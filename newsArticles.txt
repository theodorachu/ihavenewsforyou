[{"title": "Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/9I0_OlnMYSo/index.html", "text": "(CNN) As he progressed from punchline to primary contender, from frontrunner to nominee, and then from seemingly doomed general election candidate to president-elect, Donald Trump has, for all his idiosyncrasies, offered a remarkably consistent package of promises.\n\nNow, less than a week into his presidency, he is beginning to carry them out.\n\nThe grinding machinery of federal government has not checked his most extreme ambitions, as so many savvy observers predicted, and the weight of the office has not humbled or aroused in him some reservoir of internal reflection. Instead, much as we saw during the primary -- as defeated Republicans fell in line behind Trump only to be mocked or ignored -- power only emboldens him.\n\nOn Friday, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to undermine Obamacare. After a weekend spent attacking the media -- and enlisting his new press secretary to follow suit -- for accurately reporting on his inaugural crowd size, Trump kicked off Monday by reinstating a federal ban on foreign aid to organizations that include abortion or family planning in their mission statements. TPP is dead. NAFTA is on the ropes. There has been a crackdown on government social media accounts that discuss or allude to basic environmental science. Trump on Tuesday revived the Keystone XL pipeline project and ordered a review of the Dakota Access project be expedited and approved.\n\nThe wall is next. Wednesday comes with a request for federal funds to build it , though no word on how he'll compel Mexico to pick up the tab. He told ABC News on Wednesday he hopes to start construction on the wall very quickly, although getting Mexico to pay for it could get \"complicated.\"\n\nConcurrent actions will seek to increase deportations and squeeze sanctuary cities by choking off grants of federal money. In his remarks at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump undermined any notion his administration lacks the cunning to effectively implement its agenda -- with or without the acquiescence of this Congress.\n\n\"People are surprised to hear that we do not need new laws,\" he said. \"We will work within the existing system and framework.\"\n\n. Though it will not be formally titled a \"Muslim Ban,\" the coming push to delay or block entry into the United States from Muslim-majority countries -- \"terror-prone\" nations in the new vernacular -- is the logical conclusion of a policy Trump The push is slated to continue throughout the weekThough it will not be formally titled a \"Muslim Ban,\" the coming push to delay or block entry into the United States from Muslim-majority countries -- \"terror-prone\" nations in the new vernacular -- is the logical conclusion of a policy Trump introduced in December 2015 , before the first primary vote was cast. And Trump this week is expected to order a halt to the US refugee program, at least temporarily closing the door on Syrians fleeing civil war and humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nHe is also focusing on what he has taken to calling \"carnage\" here at home. The alarmist language is familiar from the campaign, when he regularly painted American cities as blood-soaked war zones. By late Tuesday, Trump had threatened intervention in Chicago, tweeting that he would \"send in the feds\" absent an immediate decline in gun violence.\n\nHours later, a little after 7 a.m. Wednesday morning, he vowed to pursue a \"major investigation\" into the massive voter fraud conspiracy he's peddled as a means of explaining away his loss in the presidential popular vote -- even though there is, again, no evidence anything of the sort occurred.\n\nAnd if that sounds outlandish, or like something that will never actually happen -- it shouldn't. Not anymore. Trump promised to smash the Washington power structure and showed he would defy all norms, social and political. His first actions have Republicans opposing the trade bills they once championed and Democrats floundering for a message.\n\nIt should be noted here that Trump is new in town and his party controls Capitol Hill. What he's doing this week requires a pen and not much more. It is not clear how effective he will be when he needs 60 Senate votes to pass a spending bill. Congress and the courts will both have their say on how to pay for these things. Less than a week into the Trump era, he has not yet been required to stare down a tectonic government bureaucracy that slows all proposals.\n\nRemember: One of the first executive actions signed by former President Barack Obama during his administration was aimed at closing the prison base at Guantanamo Bay and shuttering secret detention facilities.\n\nAn unfriendly Congress kept Guantanamo alive even as Obama shrunk its population. Trump is poised to build it up again and, according to reports in The New York Times and Washington Post, the Trump team is now drawing up plans to potentially revive the \"black sites.\"\n\nCNN has not confirmed those reports and White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the plans had not come from the White House. But they would fall in line with another promise Trump made repeatedly on the campaign trail -- to bring back torture techniques like waterboarding and \"much worse.\"\n\nAnd why would you doubt him?", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 20:51:25 GMT", "summary": "As he progressed from punchline to primary contender, from frontrunner to nominee, and then from seemingly doomed general election candidate to president-elect, Donald Trump has, for all his idiosyncrasies, offered a remarkably consistent package of promises.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump's talk puts GOP in a jam", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/-sRpJY0KbME/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) In a closed-door meeting Wednesday, House and Senate Republican leaders stressed the importance of party unity and to avoid intraparty fights that could threaten the GOP hold of Washington.\n\nBut they quickly ran into a problem: President Donald Trump.\n\nPublicly, Republicans recoiled at Trump's talk of mass voter fraud in the November elections, urging him not to use government resources to investigate a problem many in the party believe the president has vastly exaggerated -- and even Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said he wouldn't look into the matter. They dodged questions about whether Congress would appropriate billions of dollars to pay for Trump's wall along the border of Mexico.\n\nSeveral pushed back at Trump's suggestion that he may seek to restart harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, that are widely considered torture. And all this comes after Trump engaged in a fight with the media over the size of inauguration crowd, distracting from the focus of his ambitious legislative agenda at the start of his presidency.\n\nThe message many want the new President to take: Don't undercut yourself.\n\n\"Fighting over crowd size and things like that takes us off message,\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told CNN. \"If I were advising him -- and he hasn't called me -- I'd advise him and his team to stay on message, which is jobs, jobs, jobs and manufacturing.\"\n\nDespite Trump's distracting tweets and comments, the party is trying to move quickly to unite their legislative agendas. In the private meeting Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republicans that the party is considering funding Trump's border wall with Mexico through a supplemental funding package focused on border security, according to multiple attendees.\n\nDoing so could extricate the border fight from a bill that must pass to keep the government open.\n\nBut a number of Republicans are nervous about funding the wall, refusing to say if they'd back a plan to have taxpayers pay potentially billions of dollars for the project. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to have Mexico reimburse the US for the wall after initially just saying Mexico would pay for it, though many are skeptical that such an approach will work.\n\n\"When it comes to our budget, we'll have those discussions,\" said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, refusing to say three times if he'd support Congress appropriating money for the wall.\n\nPrivately, Trump convinced Ryan to prioritize a package authorizing new infrastructure projects as part of a 200-day legislative agenda for the new administration, according to one of Trump's top allies, Rep. Chris Collins of New York. Many conservatives, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, want the new infrastructure spending to be offset with spending cuts. McConnell made that case in a private White House meeting with Trump earlier this week, sources said.\n\nRyan also told members that the effort to boost infrastructure would come through various legislative proposals, such as upgrading airports, rather than one comprehensive bill, sources said.\n\n\"Initially, without the President's input, that would not have been the case,\" Collins told reporters. \"Our President has been pretty clear on setting his priorities.\"\n\nBut some of his priorities have prompted pushback, including Trump's openness to reinstating waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics.\n\n\"Those issues are settled law,\" said Sen. John Thune, No. 3 in the Senate GOP leadership, referring to a ban on waterboarding. \"Congress has spoken.\"\n\nIn a statement, Sen. John McCain of Arizona added: \"The President can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.\"\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence are set to address congressional Republicans on Thursday here in Philadelphia. Ahead of the speeches, McConnell and Ryan, speaking privately to Republican lawmakers, laid out their legislative plans -- starting with repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, gutting regulations and confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee.\n\nBut McConnell warned House Republicans not to get impatient with the deliberative nature of the Senate, saying there are limits to what his conference can accomplish with 52 members in a body where 60 votes are needed to get most things accomplished. Some House Republicans were not convinced.\n\nYet the mood was optimistic in the congressional meeting, attendees said. At one point, McConnell got a standing ovation when he said that it was his decision to leave the final Supreme Court seat vacant in the final year of Barack Obama's presidency, attendees said.\n\nBut with so many items left on the agenda, Republicans are eager for Trump to focus his energy on specific legislative initiatives -- rather than other matters, like his call for a \"major\" investigation into mass fraud during the elections.\n\nChaffetz dismissed the topic, telling reporters \"On the voter fraud issue, that really happens at the county level. I don't see any evidence. But the President has 100,000 people at the Department of Justice and if he wants to have an investigation, have at it. I just don't see any evidence of it.\"\n\n\"The oversight committee is not planning to do anything with it. If the President sees that, he's got a 100,000 he can task with doing that.\"\n\n\"I think it's very important that people have confidence in the elections and the outcome of those elections,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the No. 4 GOP leader in the House.\n\n\"I view the election as history, and we're ready to roll up our sleeves and go to work,\" Thune said.\n\nAsked about whether they were concerned about the White House not coordinating with congressional Republicans on their message and rollouts, Thune chalked up the bumpy start to a new administration in \"transition\" and noted that even the House and Senate Republicans often find themselves on opposite pages.\n\n\"It's a work in progress,\" Thune said with a laugh, as he looked over at McMorris Rodgers.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 23:12:55 GMT", "summary": "In a closed-door meeting Wednesday, House and Senate Republican leaders stressed the importance of party unity and to avoid intraparty fights that could threaten the GOP hold of Washington.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump on waterboarding: 'We have to fight fire with fire'", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/2lkfFpXTsQk/index.html", "text": "By reinstating enhanced interrogation, Trump would violate a US law ratified by the Senate in 2015 and go against the view of Defense Secretary James Mattis. CIA Director Mike Pompeo told senators earlier this month that he wouldn't sanction the use of torture, though he later said he would consider bringing back waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation measures under certain circumstances.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Trump said \"people at the highest level of intelligence\" have told him that torture does work, something military experts have refuted. He went on to say, however, that he will listen to what his Cabinet secretaries have to say about the issue.\n\n\"When ISIS is doing things that no one has ever heard of, since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?\" Trump said. \"As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.\"\n\nTrump's argument was that ISIS is beheading people and posting the videos online, but that the United States is \"not allowed to do anything.\"\n\n\"We're not playing on an even field,\" Trump said. \"I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally. But do I feel it works? Absolutely, I feel it works.\" Democrats and Republicans alike have shot down the idea of bringing back torture methods that were used by the Bush administration after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Pompeo said earlier this month that he would \"absolutely not\" restart the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation tactics that fall outside of Army Field Manuals. \"Moreover, I can't imagine I would be asked that by the President-elect,\" Pompeo said during his confirmation hearing. But in a series of written responses to questions from members of the Senate intelligence committee, Pompeo later said that while current permitted interrogation techniques are limited to those contained in the Army Field Manual, he was open to making changes to that policy. The Senate voted overwhelming to ban torture across the US government in 2015, codifying a ban President Barack Obama issued by executive order shortly after he was sworn in in 2009. Obama then signed the updated defense authorization bill into law. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said the use of torture is \"settled law\" and that \"Congress has spoken.\" The Senate intelligence committee produced a nearly 7,000-page classified report on torture, detention and interrogation after the George W. Bush administration brought back the practice. The authors of the report found the practice was ineffective and did not produce actionable intelligence. \"Reconstituting this appalling program would compromise our values, our morals and our standing as a world leader -- this cannot happen,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said in a statement on Wednesday. \"We can't base national security policies on what works on television -- policies must be grounded in reality.\"", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 22:14:13 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump said he wants to \"fight fire with fire\" when it comes to stopping terrorism, suggesting that he could be open to bringing back torture because he \"absolutely\" believes it works.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump orders construction of border wall, moves to increase deportations", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Eb1ynuqve5g/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday started to reshape US immigration enforcement policies via executive action, taking his first steps toward fulfilling some of the most contentious pledges that defined his campaign -- building a border wall and speeding the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nTrump signed two executive orders directing the construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border, boosting border patrol forces and increasing the number of immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations. The orders also call for stripping sanctuary cities of federal grant funding and announced sweeping new criteria that could make many more undocumented immigrants priorities for deportation.\n\n\"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump told employees of the Department of Homeland Security at the department's headquarters in Washington.\n\nBut while Trump directed the \"immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,\" the executive orders do not cover the cost of the wall. Trump has repeatedly promised that Mexico will reimburse US taxpayers for the construction costs, a suggestion Mexican officials have rejected out of hand.\n\nThe president's moves sent alarm bells ringing in immigrant activist circles, where questions had continued to swirl about whether Trump would truly implement many of the hard-line immigration policies he articulated during his campaign.\n\nTrump also indicated he does not need Congress to pass new legislation to implement the border control and immigration reform agenda he outlined during his campaign for president, saying he would \"work within the existing system and framework.\"\n\n\"We do not need new laws,\" Trump said soon after signing the two executive orders.\n\nThe executive orders Trump signed Wednesday call for boosting the ranks of Border Patrol forces by an additional 5,000 agents as well as for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to carry out deportations. The orders noted that the increases were subject to Congress's appropriation of sufficient funds.\n\nConstruction of the wall could begin in months, but planning for the massive project is \"starting immediately,\" Trump said Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.\n\nTrump confirmed his plans to build the wall with federal funds and then seek reimbursement from Mexico, an idea Mexico has rejected. But negotiations, he said, would begin \"relatively soon.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also for the first time appeared to articulate on Wednesday the argument he might make to Mexican officials as he looks to compel them to pay for the wall.\n\nTrump stressed Wednesday that the wall would \"help Mexico\" by deterring illegal immigration from countries further South through Mexico.\n\n\"We are going to stabilize on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's actions leave little doubt about whether his immigration policies as president would differ from his campaign rhetoric.\n\nThere remained little question, for example, about whether Trump would push to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. His increases in the number of border patrol and immigration officers -- adding 10,000 immigration officers to an ICE workforce of just 20,000 -- raised the specter of Trump's campaign promise of mass deportations.\n\nOne of Trump's executive actions was expected to call for tripling \"enforcement and removal operations/agents\" of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which is charged with arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants living in the US. The order also calls for a 5,000-person increase in Customs and Border Protection personnel.\n\nMarielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, called Trump's actions Wednesday \"extremist, ineffective and expensive\" and accused the president of using lies about immigrants to drive US policy.\n\n\"Trump is taking a wrecking ball to our immigration system. It shouldn't come as a surprise that chaos and destruction will be the outcome,\" Hincapi\u00e9 said, adding that her organization has already drafted legal papers to challenge Trump's moves.\n\nAnd Greisa Martinez, advocacy director at the United We Dream Network, argued that Trump's moves \"lay the groundwork for mass deportation.\"\n\nTrump's executive orders on Wednesday did not address those of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, which safeguard undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children or who are parents of lawful US residents from deportation. Trump during his campaign signaled he would repeal those orders.\n\nTrump also outlined new criteria for determining which undocumented immigrants should be prioritized for deportation, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions more people at the top of the federal government's list of people to deport.\n\nAny undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime that hasn't been adjudicated could be deported under the Trump administration's new policy.\n\nUnder Obama, only undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanor were considered priorities for deportation.\n\nNew priorities for deportation under Trump also include any undocumented immigrants who abuse public benefits, or simply those considered \"a risk to public safety or national security... in the judgment of an immigration officer\" -- an entirely open-ended premise.\n\nTrump's hardline immigration rhetoric and policy proposals during the campaign often put him at odds not only with Democrats but with many in his own party who called his proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border unnecessary and his calls to deport all undocumented immigrants cruel and unrealistic.\n\nTrump persevered in his hardline rhetoric throughout the campaign, resisting efforts to pivot to a more moderate stance on the issue in the general election despite calls to soften his rhetoric.\n\nNow, his actions on Wednesday took a big first step toward satisfying his political base of support that hitched to his campaign amid Trump's bold promises of building a wall, deporting undocumented immigrants and in the process creating a safer country, despite a total lack of evidence tying undocumented immigrants to higher crime rates.\n\nTrump catapulted his campaign into controversy and relevance with his announcement speech in June 2015, in which he pledged some of the hardline immigration policies he was set to enact and decried undocumented immigrants as criminals and \"rapists.\" Trump never apologized for those comments.", "publishedDate": "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:51:48 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday will start to reshape US immigration enforcement policies via executive order, taking his first steps toward fulfilling some of the most contentious pledges that defined his campaign.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump considers executive order on voter fraud", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ejj2gGDSfYI/index.html", "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump could sign an executive order or presidential memorandum initiating an investigation into voter fraud as early as Thursday, a senior administration official tells CNN. The investigation would be carried out through the Department of Justice.\n\nThe move would expand on Trump's interest in the unproven claims he has made since November's election alleging millions of illegal votes were cast, without citing any evidence.\n\n\"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and ... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\" Trump wrote in two consecutive tweets Wednesday morning.\n\nThe President wants to discuss the issue with Republican lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia and will then consider the best way to go about starting the investigation.\n\n\"He wants to tell them more about why he is talking about voter fraud\" before taking any action, the official said.\n\nShould Trump decide on the best course of action, the official said, the move could come as early as Thursday. There is some concern within the Trump White House about initiating the action before Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick to be attorney general, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes in November, but won the Electoral College and thus the presidency. Trump, however, has seemingly been fixated on the popular vote, mentioning voter fraud in regards to his popular vote loss a number of times since November.\n\nTrump's initial comments on voter fraud came Monday during a meeting with congressional leaders, where he reiterated an unsubstantiated claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe claims continued into Wednesday, when ABC News pressed the President on his opinion during an interview at the White House.\n\n\"You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe President insisted that he wants the voting process to be legitimate, pointing to a Pew report that his spokesman, Sean Spicer, used to bolster claims that there are millions of illegal votes cast during presidential elections. When ABC's David Muir told the President that the author of that report told him on Tuesday night that he found no evidence of voter fraud, Trump said that the author was \"groveling.\"\n\nTrump said he wants to launch an investigation into the matter.\n\n\"Of those votes cast, none of them come to me. None of them come to me. They would all be to the other side. None of them come to me. But when you look at the people registered, dead, illegal, and two states, and some cases maybe 3 states. We have a lot to look into,\" he said.\n\nDavid Becker, the director of the Pew study in question, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday on \"The Situation Room\" that \"there is absolutely no evidence of voter fraud even approaching (the) scale\" suggested by Trump.\n\n\"I agree completely with the secretaries of state across the country, both Republicans and Democrats, and the National Association of Secretaries of State which is bipartisan, which has said, there is absolutely no evidence of voter fraud even approaching that scale,\" he said.\n\n\"Does voter fraud exist? Yes, it does, in very small numbers. And the election officials around the country are working to investigate and prosecute those dozens of cases that might occur nationwide in an election like this. But three to five million illegal votes -- that would have been discovered not just on Election Day, but well before,\" he added. \"Fraudulent registrations, not matching the drivers license numbers and social security numbers, flagged for ID under federal law, extra provisional ballots being cast -- all of these things we would have seen, and there was zero evidence of that.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Spicer vigorously defended Trump's statement about illegal voters, though neither Trump nor his surrogates could provide evidence that any substantial illegal voting had occurred or influence the popular vote.\n\n\"I think in terms of registration, where you have got folks on rolls that have been deceased or moved or registered in two counties -- this isn't just about the 2016 election. This is about the integrity of our voting system,\" Spicer said Wednesday.\n\nTrump faced widespread criticism for his remarks, including from some congressional leaders in his own party, and Democrats have alleged that Republican efforts in the name of fighting voter fraud has the effect of preventing or delaying legal voters who traditionally back Democratic candidates\n\nOhio's secretary of state replied to Trump's tweet on Wednesday, saying his office already investigated claims of voter fraud.\n\n\"I responded ... for Ohioans, to let them know we already have an investigation, or review as we call it, underway,\" Jon Husted, a Republican, told CNN's Carol Costello Wednesday. \"In the past ... we found less than a thousand cases of voter irregularity, less than a couple hundred cases of voter fraud, and zero cases of voter suppression.\"\n\nConsidering Ohio is home to about 7 million registered voters, these cases constitute \"a small number,\" Husted said.\n\nThe reviews, which take place every two years, are best conducted at the state level, Husted said.\n\n\"I don't think that federal involvement is important in this particular matter, because the states run the elections,\" Husted said. \"We don't want federal involvement in our elections, we want to keep this in the hands of the states -- that's where it should be.\"\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie-Wasserman Schultz issued a harsh condemnation of Trump's call for an investigation, telling CNN's \"New Day\" that the tweet's message was \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\n\"He seems to be questioning the legitimacy of his own election, all while, for the last couple of months, touting how legitimate and huge his election was and historic it is. It can't be both,\" she said.\n\n\"What is the most deeply disturbing about his penchant for lying is -- if he is willing to lie about the trivial, like crowd size, or the significant, like voter fraud, then what happens if -- God forbid -- we go to war and we have our troops lives on the line and there are causalities? Is he going to send Sean Spicer out to lie about the causalities that have taken place? Are our allies going to be able to trust us?\"\n\nAnd former President Barack Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod responded on CNN on Wednesday by saying, \"It becomes an impetus for those who want to further erode voter protection for people who legitimately want to vote and are facing a series of barriers.\"\n\nWhen pushed by the media about whether Trump will call for an investigation into the matter, Spicer said, \"maybe we will,\" adding later that Trump believes in voter fraud based on \"studies and information he has.\"\n\n\"The President does believe that, I think he's stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him,\" Spicer said at Wednesday's press briefing.\n\nSpicer did not say specifically Tuesday which studies the President was using to support his claim of 3 million to 5 million illegally cast votes, but a 2014 study by Jesse Richman and David Earnest found more than 14% of non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 \"indicated that they were registered to vote.\" Only US citizens can vote in federal elections.\n\nHowever, Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, told CNN on Tuesday that his study that is apparently being cited by the White House was misinterpreted and did not support the administration's claims.\n\nA number of studies have also found no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThe Truth About Voter Fraud, a report written by experts at The Brennan Center for Justice, found voter fraud rates were between 0.00004% and 0.0009%.\n\nTrump himself -- through his lawyers -- has also argued that there was no evidence of voter fraud in the 2016 election. In a court filing objecting to Green Party candidate Jill Stein's Michigan recount petition, lawyers for the president wrote, \"All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\"\n\nJudges have identified examples of systemic efforts to distort the voter rolls in recent years.\n\nBut those efforts hurt traditionally Democratic voters and help Republicans.\n\nIn North Carolina, a federal appeals court wrote in 2016 that -- after receiving data on the use of voting practices by race -- the Republican-controlled state legislature enacted a series of laws designed to suppress African-American turnout with \"almost surgical precision.\"\n\nThe state required voters to present forms of identification disproportionately used by white people. It cut back on early voting, eliminated same-day voter registration and preregistration for voters under 18, and it eliminated Sunday voting -- with the state even arguing in court that \"counties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black\" and \"disproportionately Democratic.\"\n\n\"The General Assembly enacted them in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented African American voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting,\" Motz wrote.\n\nDemocrats also believe that new voter ID laws played a role in lowering turnout in other states -- particularly Wisconsin, where Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. Turnout there dropped nearly four points from 2012, despite record early voting numbers.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 23:57:45 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump could sign an executive order or presidential memorandum initiating an investigation into voter fraud as early as Thursday, a senior administration official tells CNN.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump finished with Supreme Court interviews", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/WyGYiV5OTHo/index.html", "text": "Trump's four finalists, the official said, are Neil Gorsuch, who sits on the federal appears court in Denver; William H.

The Border Patrol also notes that \"far fewer Mexican nationals and single adults are attempting to cross the border without authorization, while far more families and unaccompanied children are fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.\" What is different is that \"a growing share\" of these Central American migrants are surrendering to law enforcement \"to seek humanitarian protection\" rather than trying to sneak into the US undetected.

While the measure doesn't reference Islam specifically, advocacy groups said the order was plainly targeting Muslims.\n\nThe order, if enacted, would put in place tough new vetting measures in an attempt to bar potential terrorists from entering the country. Sources familiar with the order said Trump could sign it as early as Friday, but caution the language is not yet final. A senior White House official made it clear that Trump will not sign executive orders Thursday targeting the refugee program or immigration from terror-prone countries.\n\n\"In order to protect Americans, we must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward our country and its founding principles,\" the order reads. \"We cannot, and should not, admit into our country those who do not support the US. Constitution, or those who would place violent religious edicts over American law.\"\n\nThe plan outlined in the draft order indicates that once the 120-day suspension of refugee admissions ends, the US prioritize admissions of those refugees who are fleeing religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality,\" according to the order.\n\nAdmissions for Syrian refugees would be suspended indefinitely, until Trump determines the system has undergone a sufficient overhaul in vetting and screening practices. The plan would cap the total number of refugees admitted into the US during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. In addition to the months-long suspension of refugee admissions into the US, the draft order would suspend the US visa waiver programs, which allows citizens of major US allies to enter the US on a temporary tourist visa. The order also instructs the Pentagon and State Department to begin planning for \"safe zones\" inside Syria, which would provide safe harbor for civilians in the civil war-torn nation. The Obama administration had rejected safe zones as an ineffective solution to the humanitarian crisis there. And it mandates the Department of Homeland Security expedite a program of tracking migrants using biometric data like eye scans and fingerprints. Suspending the refugee program was bound to draw outcry from humanitarian groups, who have long pushed the US to accept more people seeking refuge from war and persecution. \"Make no mistake -- whatever language is used in President Trump's executive orders on refugees, immigration and visa programs -- Muslims are the sole targets of these orders,\" said Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations during a news conference in Washington. \"These orders are a disturbing confirmation of Islamophobic and un-American policy proposals made during the presidential election campaign.\" Lavinia Lim\u00f3n, president and CEO of the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, called the 120-day suspension of the refugee program \"extraordinarily cruel.\" \"It's a sad day not only for the refugees but for the country,\" she said. \"I wasn't surprised given the campaign rhetoric.

The length of the wall, when construction will begin, how much it will cost and who will pay for it remain fundamental questions.\n\nThere is also ongoing debate about the feasibility of the structure and the need for it in the first place.\n\nTrump's push for a wall dates back to the day in June 2015 when he announced his campaign and promised to \"build a great, great wall on our southern border\" and said Mexico would pay.\n\n\"Mark my words,\" he said for added effect.\n\nHis effort to turn those words into reality is expected to be formally announced Wednesday and is among several immigration-related actions anticipated in a multi-day rollout from the new administration.\n\nSince he first made the pledge, walling off our neighbors to the south became an oft-repeated promise and rallying cry, both for the candidate and his supporters. Chants of \"build that wall\" thundered through arenas and convention halls. In at least one instance, Trump himself led the cheer. Building \"an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one\" is listed as item No. 1 on his \"10 Point Plan to Put America First.\"\n\nAt the first press briefing of the new administration Monday, one of the first questions to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was about the wall. Spicer said the administration was working with agency heads and Congress to move forward on the project. He offered no further details.\n\nNot everyone is as enthusiastic as the President about building a wall, including the man whose job it was to secure the U.S. border for the past three years.\n\n\"I don't see any efficacy in building a wall across the border,\" said Gil Kerlikowske, who until last week served as Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"The border and migration issues are just unbelievably complex,\" Kerlikowske said in an interview with CNN. \"And a simple answer to a complex problem is most assuredly the wrong answer.\"\n\nTrump has yet to appoint Kerlikowske's replacement.\n\nKerlikowske said the rugged terrain in the Arizona desert and the shifting Rio Grande River in Texas, which routinely changes depth and even direction, both represent natural obstacles to building a border wall. Some of the land along the border in the Rio Grande Valley is privately owned, representing another challenge, he said.\n\nKerlikowske also noted that the vast majority of people trying to enter the US are actually showing up at border entry points and seeking asylum or turning themselves in. Most are not trying to scale the fence in the dark of night, he said. Even if a wall was built, he said, it would require a significant hiring increase to have enough agents to monitor the wall. That would be no easy feat for an agency that is currently 1,200 employees below full strength.\n\nKerlikowske said that, in addition to some 700 miles of fencing, the border is currently patrolled by agents on foot, bikes, motorcycles, ATVs and horseback. There's also an air wing, unmanned predator drones, ground sensors, infrared video and tower-mounted video with a range of 25 miles.\n\n\"It's all preferable to a wall,\" Kerlikowske said. \"Unless you monitor that wall.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump told a crowd of supporters in Anaheim, California, in May that he'd reached out to leaders in the union representing Border Patrol agents and asked whether a wall was truly needed.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, It's absolutely vital,\" came the reply, he told the crowd. \"It's an absolutely important tool. Maybe our most important tool to stop what's going on.\"\n\n\"We're going to build the wall. We have no choice.\"\n\nAt the point, the crowd began chanting, \"build that wall.\" Trump joined in from the podium.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents, endorsed Trump for President -- marking the first time the group had taken such an action.\n\nBrandon Judd, president of the council, said in a recent interview with CNN, that Trump was \"by far the best on border security\" when compared with other candidates.\n\nJudd said he didn't reach that decision based on his pledge to build a wall. He said his group favored \"barriers in strategic locations.\"\n\nBut, importantly, he didn't say those barriers had to come in the form of a wall as Trump is suggesting.\n\n'Doesn't have to be a wall'\n\n\"It doesn't have to be a wall,\" Judd said.\n\nHe called the double fencing along the border in the San Diego area \"insanely effective.\"\n\nJudd, who said he met with Trump and his transition team, argued such fencing allows agents to confront people on the US side of the border while they still have a fence in front of them to slow their progress.\n\n\"He was very much willing to listen to our perspective,\" Judd said. \"It was, you know: 'I didn't realize that'. And 'that's good to know'.\"\n\nTrump would then turn to an aide, Judd recounted, and say: \"Hey, get on this. Get back with me. I need to know more about this.\"\n\nJudd said he was confident his group's views were being taken into consideration.\n\n\"If you look at the areas they're currently surveying -- if you look at what the talk is, a lot of that is coming from us,\" he said. \"They absolutely 100% are in the process of implementing things we suggested.\"\n\nJudd said he signed a non-disclosure agreement that prohibited him from going into detail about planned construction.\n\nShawn Moran, vice president of the Border Patrol union, said he thinks most people would be surprised to learn that it's possible to drive for 30 minutes in some Border Patrol sectors and not encounter agents on patrol.\n\n\"I think a lot of Americans think you're going to see agents in towers every hundred yards,\" Moran said. \"That doesn't exist.\"\n\nHe said one instance in which a wall may have made a difference was in the 2009 slaying of Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas. Rosas was shot to death by assailants who crawled under fencing near the eastern San Diego County town of Campo.\n\nThe US-Mexico border is approximately 2,000 miles long, running from San Diego to Brownsville, Texas. Trump initially said he wanted to wall off the entire border, but has since said that 1,000 miles may do.\n\nHe has offered few details on the wall since being elected president. But speaking at a news conference earlier this month, he reiterated his pledge, referring to the border as \"an open sieve.\" He made construction sound imminent.\n\n\"Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin,\" he told reporters on Jan. 11.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that Trump transition team officials had been in discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department to begin planning a wall, including how certain environmental laws could come into play.\n\n\"It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall,\" said one U.S. official familiar with the inquiry.\n\nA review of Trump's statements on the campaign trail offers a glimpse of what he envisions -- or did at the time.\n\nTrump said his wall would be solid, strong and \"probably 35 to 40 feet up in the air.\"\n\n\"It will actually look good,\" he added. \"You know, as good as a wall is going to look.\"\n\nThe dimensions of the border barricade grew when former Mexican President Vicente Fox insisted his country would never pay for it.\n\n\"It just got 10 feet taller,\" Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last year.\n\nWhen then-Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush referred to the proposed wall as a fence in August of 2015, Trump took to Twitter to correct him:\n\n\"It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL,\" Trump tweeted, \"and there's a BIG difference!\"\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC in February, then-candidate Trump said he'd priced out the project at about $8 billion. Later that month, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity the cost would be $10 billion.\n\n\"It's going to be a very terrific wall,\" Trump said. \"$10 billion is not bad.\"\n\nHannity asked Trump, whose name is synonymous with his brand as a builder and hotelier whether the name Trump will be on the wall.\n\n\"Only if its' beautiful,\" he replied.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 21:47:13 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump is following through with one of the first pledges he made a year and a half ago when he announced his long-shot bid for the White House -- directing federal resources toward building a wall along the southern border.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "First on CNN: Democrats prepare to battle Trump on voting access", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/NSSY1DpJ000/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has called for a \"major investigation\" into his baseless claims that millions of illegal votes were cast -- but Democrats fear it will morph into new efforts to limit voting access.\n\nKey party figures are gearing up to fight what they worry will be a spate of restrictive new election laws in GOP-controlled states -- largely enacted in reaction to fears that the White House is fanning.\n\nTrump's claims of 3 to 5 million illegal votes are \"a dog-whistle for Republican legislators who are looking for the go-ahead to enact restrictive voting laws to make it harder for people to vote,\" said Marc Elias, Democrats' top elections lawyer.\n\nPriorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC and a key Clinton backer in 2016, is aiming to turn its nonprofit arm into the party's major hub to fight for voting access.\n\nElias, who was the Hillary Clinton campaign's attorney, is joining the Priorities USA board of directors and the organization is absorbing Every Citizen Counts, which spent $17 million in 2016 on Elias-led legal challenges to what it saw as restrictive voting laws in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio and Virginia.\n\nIn addition to backing Elias's efforts, Priorities USA is also building a national database that's intended to serve as a one-stop inventory of restrictive voting measures which will be shared with other progressive organizations. And it plans to launch social advocacy campaigns around its efforts to fight those measures. The group soon plans to bring on more staff to support the effort.\n\n\"We need to take a clear and aggressive stand that we're going to do everything we can,\" said Guy Cecil, the Priorities USA chairman.\n\nTrump hasn't provided any evidence to support his claims of massive voter fraud, and Elias said he sees the White House's actions as motivated by Trump's ego, rather than genuine concern about voter fraud.\n\n\"It just shows how desperate he is to avoid looking like he got fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in the election,\" he said. \"There were not millions of illegal votes. No one genuinely believes there were millions of illegal votes. And the President of the United States should be ashamed of himself for making this up.\"\n\nElias added: \"It shows how clownish he can be around these issues where he's thin-skinned.\"\n\nHis comments came after Trump's White House said it plans to launch an investigation into voter fraud.\n\n\"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and ... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\" Trump wrote in two consecutive tweets Wednesday morning.\n\nSuch an investigation would be \"completely unprecedented,\" one Justice Department official said, because there is no specific, credible allegation of voter fraud for the department to investigate. So far, officials say there is zero evidence to support Trump's claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said the investigation would focus on states where Trump did not compete, but did not say why the investigation would not also include states where Clinton did not compete.\n\nAnd the White House has offered no evidence to support Trump's claims -- repeated in a meeting with congressional leaders this week -- that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally.\n\nDemocrats said they have seen this playbook before.\n\nCecil recalled working on Mark Pryor's Senate race in Arkansas in 2002. He said GOP officials stood outside polling places, took photos of voters as they arrived and asked to see their IDs.\n\n\"This is a new version of that,\" he said. \"This is just the institutionalizing of voter suppression in a way we haven't seen in some time.\"\n\nState elections officials have said Trump is right that some voter registrations are out of date. People die and people relocate -- and due to bureaucratic backups, some counties are slow to remove those former residents from their voter rolls.\n\nBut both Democrats and Republicans argue there are actually very few instances of voter fraud in which people cast multiple ballots, vote in someone else's name or vote despite being ineligible.\n\n\"All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\" Trump's lawyers wrote.\n\nBut while cases of voter fraud are few and far between, judges have identified examples of systemic efforts to distort the voter rolls in recent years.\n\nBut those efforts voter suppression efforts hurt traditionally Democratic voters and help Republicans.\n\nSome Democrats have said those efforts were a clear indication of voter fraud.\n\nThe state required voters to present forms of identification disproportionately used by white people. It cut back on early voting, limited same-day voter registration and preregistration for voters under 18, and it eliminated Sunday voting -- with the state even arguing in court that \"counties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black\" and \"disproportionately Democratic.\"\n\nUS Circuit Judge Diana Motz wrote in that the laws were \"enacted with racially discriminatory intent.\"\n\n\"The General Assembly enacted them in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented African-American voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting,\" Motz wrote.\n\nDemocrats also believe that new voter ID laws played a role in lowering turnout in other states -- particularly Wisconsin, where Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. Turnout there dropped nearly 4 points from 2012, despite record early voting numbers.\n\nDemocrats are already preparing for fights in more states.\n\nOne possibility is Texas, where the Obama administration's Justice Department had led a challenge to the state's voter ID law, but Trump's administration has sought a pause in that case.\n\n\"I wish I could say that we are running out of states that were enacting bad voting laws to challenge. Unfortunately, a tremendous amount of damage has already been done to the ability to vote in this country by irresponsible legislative action before Trump took office,\" Elias said. \"I suspect that that now will accelerate.\"", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 22:36:21 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump has called for a \"major investigation\" into his baseless claims that millions of illegal votes were cast -- but Democrats fear it will morph into new efforts to limit voting access.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "What the US-Mexico border looks like before Trump's wall", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/NjMNwzfVbIs/index.html", "text": "The Rio Grande snakes along the US-Mexico border on January 3, 2017, near McAllen, Texas.

Trump quickly shifted the focus to the wall Wednesday after he issued an executive order saying that he would rely on a 2006 law to build his signature wall along the southern border. That announcement came to dominate much of the debate among Republican lawmakers gathered in Philadelphia. Congressional Republicans escaped Washington Wednesday to try to focus on top issues -- including replacing Obamacare. But Trump swiftly ripped the focus away with his executive action on a border wall and reports that he may reopen the use torture sites outlawed by Congress. Sen. John Thune, the Senate's No. 3 Republican who is co-hosting this week's retreat, responded to reports that Trump may seek to re-open CIA \"blacksites\" by noting that the issue was \"settled law,\" and Trump would likely have trouble changing the ban on the use of torture. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said later Wednesday pushed back on the reports, saying that the document did not come from the White House. Thune brushed aside Trump's claims of voter fraud -- and a call for an investigation -- indicating to the new President it is time to get back on track. \"I view the election as history, and we're ready to roll up our sleeves and go to work,\" Thune said. And Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the House's No. 4 Republican, said: \"I think it's very important that people have confidence in the elections and the outcome of those elections.\" And then the questions turned to how Congress would pay for Trump's proposed border wall -- which was rolled out by the White House just hours earlier. McMorris Rodgers deflected questions by saying she hadn't seen Trump's proposal yet. Thune then said that any proposal would have to be accounted for by Congress, and not add to the debt. \"On the wall, I supported the wall and, yes, it should be paid for,\" Thune said. Asked about whether they were concerned about the White House not coordinating with congressional Republicans on their message and roll outs, Thune chalked up the bumpy start to a new administration in \"transition\" and noted that even the House and Senate Republicans often find themselves on opposite pages. \"It's a work in progress,\" Thune said with a laugh, as he looked over at McMorris Rodgers.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 22:52:28 GMT", "summary": "Congress may pay for the border wall through a special spending bill being hashed out over the next two months, footing the cost of President Donald Trump's priority before seeking any refund from Mexico, Republican lawmakers said Wednesday.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "After EPA communications lockdown, environmental agencies 'terrified' of Trump", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/n3I_GFRRsmw/index.html", "text": "EPA employees have been instructed not to release press releases, publish blog posts or post anything on social media.\n\n\"These restrictions are effective immediately and will remain in place until further direction is received from the new Administration's Beach Team,\" reads the memo written by Joanne Amorosi, the communications director at the EPA's Office of Administration and Resources Management.\n\n\"Incoming media requests will be carefully screened,\" Amorosi wrote. \"No new content can be placed on any website.

The lockdowns have led to widespread discontent inside government agencies that deal with climate change and environmental protections. Career staffers at the Interior Department, which includes the Park Service, are \"terrified\" that their day-to-day operations could run afoul of the Trump administration's desires, a source with knowledge of the situation inside the government agency tells CNN. Career staffers at the department were concerned about their job security before Friday's order regarding the Twitter account, but tensions are even higher now, the source says, leaving many at the department feeling like they have to be extra careful as they go about their daily routines because it is unclear what could set off the White House or Trump's political appointees. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said reports of gag orders to the EPA are \"just appalling\" and that the Trump administration seems \"to be happy to be in a fact-free zone.\" Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, Pelosi also addressed reports of efforts to take down climate change material on the EPA website, calling such activity a \"deterioration of intellectual sources to prevent information to flow.\" \"That's what has made America great that we have open, we listen to ideas and exchange them and any country that doesn't does so to their own detriment,\" she said. Jeremy Symons, a former career employee at the EPA who worked through the transition between President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said this sort of information lock down is \"unprecedented.\" \"It didn't happen,\" Symons, who now works at the Environmental Defense Fund, said when asked whether anything like this happened during the Clinton-Bush transition. \"This administration is walking into this transition... as though the impartial experts that keep the government running are political enemies and that is a mistake at EPA or any agency.\" He added, \"It bodes badly for what we should expect moving forward from here.\" Trump agency websites are being closely watched both from both inside and outside the government. Badlands National Park's official Twitter account tweeted statistics about climate change on Tuesday, drawing attention from Democrats and others opposed to Trump administration policies. The tweets were up for mere hours before they were deleted.

At a news conference just moments after Trump's executive order was announced, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said his city wouldn't budge.\n\n\"I haven't read the content of the sanctuary city (order), but I want to make very clear, we are going to stay a sanctuary city. We welcome, just as in the spirit of what Cardinal (Blase) Cupich talked about, 'there is no stranger among us,'\" Emanuel said.\n\nBut what is a sanctuary city? And can Trump really defund them?\n\nHere's a look at what the term means and its implications in immigration policy under Trump.\n\nThe term \"sanctuary city\" is a broad term applied to jurisdictions that have policies in place designed to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions. Cities, counties and some states have a range of informal policies as well as actual laws that qualify as \"sanctuary\" positions.\n\nMost of the policies center around not cooperating with federal law enforcement on immigration policies. Many of the largest cities in the country have forms of such policies.\n\nThe idea for sanctuary cities appears to have sprung out of churches in the 1980s that provide sanctuary to Central Americans fleeing violence at home amid reluctance by the federal government to grant them refugee status. They became popular in more diverse locales to counter what officials there saw as overzealous federal immigration policies, particularly against those arrested for minor, non-violent crimes.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThere is no single definition for a sanctuary city.\n\nChicago has set up a similar fund, as has Los Angeles, and they're under consideration in other major cities, like New York.\n\nEmanuel also referenced Chicago's \"Welcoming City Ordinance,\" a collection of laws similar to others around the country that make clear Chicago will not help investigate the citizenship status of individuals unless mandated by law or a court, will not discriminate issuing city services depending on citizenship and will not cooperate with immigration detentions.\n\nThe goal of the constellation of informal and formal policies is generally to protect undocumented immigrants who are not otherwise engaged in criminal activity from being detained or deported.\n\nWho objects to these practices?\n\nSome conservatives have opposed these policies for years, as they have sought tougher immigration laws that crack down on undocumented immigrants living in the US.\n\nTrump made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign, at one time saying he would support a deportation force to round up all the millions of immigrants living in the US illegally. He has since backed off that position, with his surrogates saying his administration will prioritize removing criminals.\n\nAs major urban centers tend to be run by Democratic politicians, who support more forgiving immigration policies, many cities have been locked in battles with Republican leaders nationally over the policies.\n\nICE has also said the policies inhibit their ability to enforce immigration laws.\n\nOpponents of sanctuary cities also often cite cases of crimes perpetrated or allegedly perpetrated by undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn one of the most emotionally charged challenges to sanctuary cities, the parents of Kate Steinle, a young woman who was allegedly fatally shot by an undocumented immigrant recently released from jail, attempted to sue San Francisco over its sanctuary city policy. The lawsuit claimed the sheriff and city were partly to blame for her death.\n\nA judge ruled this month, however, dismissing the claim.\n\nStill, Steinle's 2015 murder has been a rallying cry for opponents of sanctuary cities and those who seek tougher immigration policies.\n\nThe order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after OMB's review, Spicer explained that the funding identified could be taken away.\n\nWhile the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through Congress, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.\n\nAside from congressionally provided funds, there are a number of grants administered by federal agencies that could mean big money lost to cities and states.\n\nOne such program is the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, administered by the Department of Justice, points out Hans von Spakovsky, a legal and immigration expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation who advocates for policies like those implemented by Trump.\n\nThat fund alone allocated $274.9 million in 2016, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the five states with the most allocations were California, at $30.5 million; Texas, at $21.4 million; Florida, with $17.8 million; New York, with $15.6 million; and Illinois, at $10.4 million.\n\nThe move, when finalized, will almost certainly generate court challenges.\n\nThe courts have held in the past that the federal government can only strip funding that is related to the policy involved -- so it's unlikely to hold up if the administration tried to take away highway funds, for example, according to experts. The courts have also ruled that funding decisions may not be used to \"coerce\" states into actions.\n\nBut something like the JAG program, which supports law enforcement, might be considered germane to the issue.\n\nThe matter will likely end up in the courts -- as did many of Obama's immigration executive actions.\n\n\"It's a gray area how far the federal government can go in basically engaging in what some might call coercive behavior using federal money as an angle, but that would make for a very spirited, interesting litigation fight, and in the vast majority of these cases, the federal government has won,\" von Spakovsky said in an interview before the executive orders were issued.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 22:09:05 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday designed to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities -- setting up a showdown with immigration advocates.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Academic behind voter fraud research said Trump misinterpreted his data", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/GPCo8fWRJkM/index.html", "text": "One of the academics who produced data suspected of being behind the White House's assertion that millions of illegal votes were cast in 2016 says the Trump administration and other academics are misinterpreting his research.\n\nBrian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room\" Tuesday his study on voter fraud that is apparently being cited by the White House did not support the President's conclusions.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer did not say expressly on Tuesday which study Trump has read to support his claim of 3 to 5 million illegally cast votes, but a 2014 study by Jesse Richman and David Earnest found more than 14% of non-citizens in 2008 and 2010 \"indicated that they were registered to vote.\"\n\nThe study was designed by Schaffner's Cooperative Congressional Election Study, but he told Blitzer that he and his colleagues spoke with voters who had self-identified themselves as \"non-citizens\" and discovered that they had all mistakenly clicked the wrong radio button during the survey -- and they were all actually citizens.\n\n\"It's very frustrating as I'm sure you can imagine.

He was raised by a very demanding father and his father did not tolerate anything but complete victory and success in everything that Donald did.\"\n\nBut now, Trump has finally arrived at a position where the scrutiny is intense and claims and boasts that could be put down to the braggadocio of a real estate tycoon in the business world no longer fly.\n\n\"This is the first time in his life that he has to play by rules that other people establish ... (but) he doesn't see any difference between salesmanship and being a president,\" said D'Antonio, also author of a new book about Barack Obama called \"A Consequential President.\"\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of Trump's desire for recognition is that while there are millions of Americans who would never vote Republican or who were appalled by Trump's behavior on the campaign trail, official Washington has accepted him as President with little reservation. Even Bill and Hillary Clinton made a point of attending his inauguration Friday.\n\nNotwithstanding his searing condemnation of the city's political elites in his inaugural address, congressional leaders have already traveled to the White House to yuck it up with the new President. Republicans are consulting him as they lay out a legislative schedule. Democrats, as is normal for an opposition party shut out of power, are plotting their resistance.\n\nBut Trump seems unable to turn the other cheek -- even before his inauguration he launched into a Twitter tirade against Democratic Rep. John Lewis who had said he was not a legitimate President, instead of taking the politically wiser course of just shrugging off the revered congressman's jab.\n\nSpicer offered a revealing glimpse into the President's psyche during his first briefing on Monday, prompted by a question from CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\n\"There is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has,\" Spicer said. \"And I think that it's just unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough, it's not good enough, you can't win.\"\n\nSpicer said that Trump had not been taken seriously when he started to run for president and had constantly been told that he would lose.\n\n\"He's gone out there and defied the odds over and over and over again. And he keeps getting told what he can't do by this narrative that's out there,\" Spicer said, in remarkably candid comments for a presidential spokesman.\n\n\"And he exceeds it every single time. And I think there's an overall frustration when you turn on the television over and over again and get told that there's this narrative that you didn't win.\"\n\nWhile those sentiments may accurately reflect opinion in Trump's inner circle, they do not take into account that Trump's preoccupation with triviality could become a liability for his administration.\n\nHe's already triggered a furious backlash on Capitol Hill after repeating his conspiracy theory about his failure to win the popular vote in front of congressional leaders on Monday, according to several sources.\n\n\"If the President of the United States is claiming that 3.5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy -- he needs to disclose why he believes that,\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, said he saw no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\n\"I would suggest the White House looks in their windshield and not the rearview mirror. They did something that nobody thought they could do. They should be proud (of) that and not let this be a distraction,\" Hurd told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nThere are also longer term implications for Trump's failure to develop a thicker skin.\n\nHis White House will face far more political pressure and unflattering press coverage in the future than it does now.\n\nThere will be times when it feels the Oval Office is the most isolated place in the entire world. The most successful presidents are those who can still function under that intense scrutiny. And the most capable White House staffs help a president maintain the credibility and trust that he must call upon in times of crisis \u2014 whatever his press clippings say.\n\nStill, as he fends of criticism over his comments, Trump can console himself that he is not alone in experiencing intense frustration over his press coverage and feeling he is not getting his due as President.\n\nAfter winning a landslide in 1964, Lyndon Johnson complained that journalists were criticizing him as having no rapport with voters or saying he was just the beneficiary of fighting against a weak Republican candidate in Barry Goldwater.\n\nIn comments strikingly similar to Trump's, LBJ told his adviser Edwin Weisl in a telephone call: \"I had the biggest crowd they ever had before and I got the biggest vote anybody ever got before. I had the greatest affection that had ever been demonstrated,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"But they say 'Aw-w-w-w, that doesn't amount to anything,\" Johnson said, in a transcript of the call included in the book \"Reaching for Glory\" by Michael Beschloss.\n\nSoon after his inauguration in 1993, Bill Clinton complained that he had never really had a \"honeymoon\" with the press which he thought was more interested in sensational leaks than substantive politics,\" according to the Taylor Branch's book \"The Clinton Tapes.\"\n\nStill, Clinton and LBJ did not take the same approach as Trump \u2014 who blared out his anger publicly \u2014 instead leaving it to history to reveal their fury.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 16:54:45 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump's refusal to let sleeping dogs lie now threatens to harm his presidency.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "US Defense chief to visit Japan, South Korea", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/qUbuIFqiUXk/index.html", "text": "The four-day trip beginning next Wednesday will \"underscore the commitment of the United States to our enduring alliances,\" said US Navy Capt.

Axios.com was the first to report the plan, which a source familiar with the document tells CNN has since been revised. But environmentalists say it's clear the agency is in for hard times. \"The EPA is already operating under constrained budgets, and for example we already feel they are constrained in their ability to implement the safe water and clean water acts.

So we hope the President will join us,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference unveiling the proposal Tuesday. \"And we call on the President to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop their opposition to investing in infrastructure and get on board with this plan.\"\n\nThe issue could become an early test of whether Trump's willingness during the campaign to break with Republican leaders has carried into the White House -- or if he will show patience for GOP lawmakers through a lengthy legislative process and instead target Democrats.\n\nBefore his inauguration, Trump made clear he intended to elevate Schumer as his chief opponent on Capitol Hill -- tweeting that his fellow New Yorker is Democrats' \"head clown.\"\n\nBut on Inauguration Day, the two were seen speaking at length at a congressional luncheon for Trump.\n\nThe two evidently got along Monday when Trump called both parties' House and Senate leaders to the White House for a meeting, too.\n\n\"I enjoyed the President and Sen. Schumer talking about all the people they knew in New York,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, deadpanned after Monday's meeting.\n\nSchumer said he's spoken with Trump at length about infrastructure, too.\n\n\"I told him repeatedly, 'If you want to do a bill like this, you're going to have to tell a lot of your Republicans -- particularly on the right wing -- that they're not going to get their way,' \" Schumer said. \"And he acknowledged that. So we'll see what happens.\"\n\nTuesday's $1 trillion proposal would potentially create 15 million jobs over 10 years, Democrats said. It includes $210 billion for road and bridge repair, $110 billion for water and sewer programs, $180 billion for rail and bus systems, $200 billion for new projects deemed as vital, $75 billion to rebuild schools, $70 billion for ports and $100 billion for energy grid upgrades.\n\nDemocrats said they were insisting on using tax dollars to pay for the package, rather than tax credits, as Trump advisers and Republicans have floated.\n\n\"President Trump campaigned on rebuilding the infrastructure,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said at Tuesday's news conference. \"Let's do it -- but let's do it in a way that doesn't provide huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and to large corporations.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans for years rejected former President Barack Obama's requests for more money for improvements to the nation's roads, bridges, airports and waterways.\n\nBut Trump has sided with Obama -- and even as his aides insist public-private partnerships and tax credits can be used to fulfill the President's vision, he has pledged to eliminate graft, simplify the tax code and embark on an ambitious infrastructure project.\n\n\"We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation,\" Trump vowed in his inaugural address.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters that Republicans are waiting for the Trump administration -- including McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, the nominee for transportation secretary -- to present an infrastructure proposal.\n\n\"My understanding is the administration has a team who are putting together a proposal that we can all take a look at. That includes people both inside the administration and I think the secretary of transportation. And they're going to come up with a proposal. We'll take a look at it,\" McConnell said.\n\n\"I hope it will be something credibly paid for,\" he said. \"We have a $21 trillion debt. But I think we would all like to tackle infrastructure in a credible way and hopefully that's what they'll recommend.\"\n\nSchumer and Senate Democrats are hoping to quickly drive a wedge between Trump and Republican lawmakers -- denying them time to figure out how to structure and pay for a major infrastructure bill.\n\nThe move is aimed squarely at separating Trump's blue-collar supporters from congressional Republicans.\n\n\"That is something that congressional Democrats have sought for years, but congressional Republicans have stymied us at every turn,\" Schumer said Tuesday.\n\nIt comes with Trump already using his executive power and visibility to take concrete steps to impress his Midwestern base -- pulling the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, setting a start for the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and taking executive action to advance the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nLabor unions, traditionally a key Democratic ally, had long sought those moves -- but Democratic leaders, including former President Barack Obama and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, resisted.\n\nLabor union leaders also visited Trump in the White House on Monday.\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Clinton, heaped praise on Trump for pulling out of the TPP, calling it \"an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people.\"\n\nTrump's early maneuverings have left Democrats sensing danger -- but also seeing an opening. Trump's moves on trade were criticized by Capitol Hill Republicans. And his calls for a massive infrastructure project have triggered GOP concerns about such a program's price tag.\n\nDemocrats see the need to exploit that divide quickly: In the 2018 midterm elections, Democratic-held Senate seats are on the ballot in nearly every state in the industrial Midwest, where Trump's popularity with white, working-class voters carried him to the presidency.\n\nThe party hopes Trump, already unpopular for a new president, will be toxic by the midterms -- with many Democrats pointing to Saturday's women's marches and the higher-than-expected turnout at pro-Obamacare rallies as evidence that the political tide is changing.\n\nBut as a hedge, Democrats are seeking ways to split GOP lawmakers from Trump -- giving their members ways to accuse Republicans of rejecting popular elements of Trump's platform that Democrats support.", "publishedDate": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 21:11:10 GMT", "summary": "Senate Democrats are offering President Donald Trump a $1 trillion proposal to upgrade the nation's aging infrastructure -- but he'd have to split with Republicans to get it.", "source": "CNN", "authors": "", "tags": []}, {"title": "Donald Trump Stands By Voter-Fraud Claim", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-sticks-to-voter-fraud-claim-1485304240?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy", "text": "President Donald Trump has quickly advanced a number of top policy initiatives in the opening days of his administration, placing an emphasis on creating the jobs he promised on the campaign trail.\n\nBut the president\u2019s insistence that his November vote total and inaugural-crowd size were bigger than all evidence suggests have proved a distraction, overshadowing early moves to fulfill his campaign pledges and unnerving some of the...", "publishedDate": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 22:36:34 EST", "summary": "The White House faced Tuesday a barrage of questions about President Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that millions of people voted illegally during the Nov. 8 election.", "source": "WSJ", "authors": "", "tags": ["PAID"]}, {"title": "Trump Hastens Plan for Border Wall, Immigration Ban", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-take-executive-actions-on-immigration-1485302909?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy", "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump is set to announce plans to expedite construction of a wall along the Mexican border, and is preparing orders that ban people from countries deemed a terror risk from entering the U.S. as well as suspend the U.S. refugee program.\n\nMr. Trump plans to travel Wednesday to the Department of Homeland Security, where he said he would be announcing his border-security plans.

The war, now in its sixth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people, contributed to Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II and given the Islamic State (ISIS) group room to grow into a global terror threat.\n\nRebel groups in Syria are bitter over a string of territorial losses, including last month's defeat in Aleppo, Syria's largest city.

Citizens of\u00a0Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen would be unable to obtain U.S. visas for at least 30 days.\n\nTrump is expected to sign the order this week. It was not clear if the draft will be revised before then.\n\nAccording to the AP, Trump's draft shows that he will order Homeland Security and State Department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that don't provide it. The order says the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States.\n\nExceptions would be made for diplomats, NATO visas or those people traveling to work at the United Nations.\n\nDuring the campaign Trump, said vetting procedures were inadequate and suggested that terrorists could pose as Syrian refugees to infiltrate the United States.\n\nWhile suspending visas for Syrians, Trump is also asking that officials from the departments of State and Defense to draft plans for safe zones in and around Syria.\n\nTrump has the authority to determine how many refugees are accepted annually and he can suspend the program at any time. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, restarting months later.\n\nDuring the last budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria and President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000.\n\nTrump, according to his yet-to-be-signed executive order, will cut that program by more half to 50,000. The order said while the program is suspended, the U.S. may admit people on a case-by-case basis \"when in the national interest\" and the government would continue to process refugee requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion....is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" That suggests that would allow the admission of Christians from Muslim-majority countries.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump issued orders aimed at moving ahead with a wall on the Mexican border and blocking federal funds from \"sanctuary cities\" that protect immigrants.\n\n\u201cA nation without borders is not a nation,\u201d Trump declared after signing the measures, while speaking to employees at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cBeginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.\u201d\n\nThe first order calls for the \u201cimmediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,\u201d and directs the DHS secretary to take \u201call appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct\u201d the wall using authority under existing law.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not yet clear exactly how the project might be funded or how much it would cost, Trump reiterated his vow that Mexico \u201cabsolutely\u201d will pay for the project eventually, something the Mexican government has denied.\n\n\u201cUltimately it will come out of what\u2019s happening with Mexico,\u201d Trump told ABC News in a separate interview, adding construction could begin in a matter of months.\n\nMexico\u2019s contribution aside, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said existing Homeland Security funding could be used for now to get started, and congressional appropriations eventually would be needed. The order itself calls for the preparation of congressional budget requests.\n\nThe same executive order also calls for hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and ending \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d policies for illegal immigrants, among other provisions.\n\nAnother order is aimed at helping federal immigration agents. It calls for hiring 10,000 additional officers; restoring the so-called Secure Communities program and other local partnerships; prioritizing the deportation of illegal immigrant criminals; directing the State Department to use leverage to ensure illegal immigrants are taken back by their country of origin \u2013 and moving to strip federal grant money to sanctuary states and cities that \u201charbor\u201d illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "publishedDate": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 23:03:00 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump will order the U.S. government to stop accepting Syrian refugees and suspend the issuing of visas to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, according to a draft executive order obtained by the Associated Press Wednesday.", "source": "Fox News", "authors": "", "tags": ["ee3f7d83-0c29-4c9b-8204-28ce569e5ff5", "fox-news/politics/executive/national-security", "fox-news/politics/executive/white-house", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/National Security", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House", "fnc", "fnc/politics/executive", "article", "FoxNews.com"]}, {"title": "Fox News Poll:  The American dream", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/co46n02ipQo/fox-news-poll-american-dream.html", "text": "A large majority of American voters believes they have achieved the American Dream -- or it\u2019s within sight for their family.\n\nThe latest Fox News Poll also asks, what defines the American Dream today?

AES said it was told to accelerate the pace of work so that the then-Republican presidential candidate could hold a televised media event to celebrate the \"soft opening\" of the luxury hotel prior to the November election.\n\n\n\nA statement issued by the Trump Organization said that such business disputes are not uncommon during the close-out phase of construction projects of the scale and complexity of the project.\n\n\n\n\"The Trump Organization has invested over $200 million into the redevelopment of the historic Old Post Office and is incredibly proud of what is now considered to be one the most iconic hotels anywhere in the country,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nAES said its workers were required to work overtime hours for 50 consecutive days to finish the electrical and fire alarm work at the building before the campaign event. Without the extra work, the company said the building would not have met fire codes and would not have been permitted to open.\n\n\n\nTrump's campaign orchestrated a lavish ribbon-cutting event at the hotel, which the candidate used to laud his own business acumen.

AES is also suing two of Trump's primary construction contractors.\n\n\n\nTrump's long history of refusing to pay vendors and contractors was the subject of numerous news stories last year.

The number of \"full democracies\" dropped in 2016 from 20 to 19, according to the report.\n\nThe economic organization gives grades through five categories: Electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties. It then ranks countries as either a full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid regime and authoritarian regime.\n\nWhile the report was released the first week of the presidency of Donald Trump, the group stressed the lower ranking was not due to the new administration, but rather to public confidence in government.\n\n\"By tapping a deep strain of political disaffection with the functioning of democracy, Mr. Trump became a beneficiary of the low esteem in which U.S. voters hold their government, elected representatives and political parties, but he was not responsible for a problem that has had a long gestation,\" the report reads.\n\nThe U.S. has been \"teetering on the brink of becoming a flawed democracy\" for years, according to the report.\n\nThe erosion of the U.S. public trust in government began in the 1960s with the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F.

(INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109\u2011367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104\u2011208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:\n\nSection 1. \u00a0Purpose. \u00a0Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. \u00a0Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. \u00a0Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. \u00a0The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.\n\nTransnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. \u00a0Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. \u00a0Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.\n\nFederal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border. \u00a0Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws \u2011\u2011 and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders \u2011\u2011 the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. \u00a0The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0It is the policy of the executive branch to:\n\n(a) \u00a0secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;\n\n(b) \u00a0detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;\n\n(c) \u00a0expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;\n\n(d) \u00a0remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and\n\n(e) \u00a0cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Definitions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0\"Asylum officer\" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).\n\n(b) \u00a0\"Southern border\" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.\n\n(c) \u00a0\"Border States\" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.\n\n(d) \u00a0Except as otherwise noted, \"the Secretary\" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n(e) \u00a0\"Wall\" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.\n\n(f) \u00a0\"Executive department\" shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n(g) \u00a0\"Regulations\" shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.\n\n(h) \u00a0\"Operational control\" shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. \u00a0The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:\n\n(a) \u00a0In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\n\n(b) \u00a0Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\n\n(c) \u00a0Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\n\n(d) \u00a0Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Detention Facilities. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.\n\nSec. 6. \u00a0Detention for Illegal Entry. \u00a0The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. \u00a0The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as \"catch and release,\" whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.\n\nSec. 7. \u00a0Return to Territory. \u00a0The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.\n\nSec. 8. \u00a0Additional Border Patrol Agents. \u00a0Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.\n\nSec. 9. \u00a0Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. \u00a0The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. \u00a0Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. \u00a0Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.\n\nSec. 10. \u00a0Federal-State Agreements. \u00a0It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\n(a) \u00a0In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).\n\n(b) \u00a0To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. \u00a0Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.\n\n(c) \u00a0To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.\n\nSec. 11. \u00a0Parole, Asylum, and Removal. \u00a0It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.\n\n(a) \u00a0The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.\n\n(c) \u00a0Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).\n\n(d) \u00a0The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.\n\n(e) \u00a0The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.\n\nSec. 12. \u00a0Authorization to
