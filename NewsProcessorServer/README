Hello!

I used https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world to learn Flask.

Use http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21214270/flask-run-function-every-hour for cron job advice.

How to use:
Run Server: ./runFlaskServer

Virtual Environment:
I'm using a virtual environment so you don't have to download anything. Just remember to activate it via 'source Virtualenv/bin/activate' and deactivate it by typing 'deactivate'

Weird files:
1) runtime.txt - specifies python version for heroku
2) Procfile - also for heroku
