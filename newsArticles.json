Boente said he would enforce the president\u2019s directive until he was replaced by Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala).\n\n\u201cYes, I will,\u201d he said in a brief phone interview with The Washington Post. \u201cI was enforcing it this afternoon. Our career department employees were defending the action in court, and I expect that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do tomorrow, appropriately and properly.\u201d\n\nLater Monday, he formally rescinded Yates\u2019s order and ordered Justice Department employees \u201cto do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our President.\u201d\n\nThe move came just hours after Yates ordered the Justice Department not to defend Trump\u2019s immigration order, declaring in a memo that she was not convinced the order is lawful. Yates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure that the department\u2019s position is \u201clegally defensible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\u201d Yates wrote. She wrote that \u201cfor as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\u201d\n\n[Who is Sally Yates? Meet the acting attorney general Trump fired for \u2018betraying\u2019 the Justice Department]\n\nThe stunning events marked the latest sign of turmoil over Trump\u2019s announcement Friday that he would shut the U.S. borders to refugees and those entering the country from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMore than 100 State Department diplomats have signed a memo objecting to Trump\u2019s order, arguing that it will not deter attacks on American soil. The document, which says Trump\u2019s ban will generate ill will toward U.S. citizens, is destined for what\u2019s known as the department\u2019s Dissent Channel, which was set up during the Vietnam War as a way for diplomats to signal to senior leadership their disagreement on foreign policy decisions.\n\nYates was a holdover from the Obama administration, but her move still represented notable disagreement from someone who would be on the front lines of implementing it.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nA Justice Department official said that hours after Yates released her memo refusing to defend the president\u2019s executive order, she was delivered a one-line letter from the head of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel saying that she had been removed. The White House then announced her firing with a statement criticizing her as \u201can Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to get serious about protecting our country,\u201d the statement said. \u201cCalling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\u201d\n\n[Read the White House statement on Sally Yates]\n\nSessions, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Justice Department permanently, is awaiting Senate confirmation, although it could come as early as this week. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider his nomination Tuesday, and the entire Senate must wait one day before voting. A spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment.\n\nBoente (pronounced BEN-tay), who was sworn in at 9 p.m., said he would serve until Sessions is confirmed, which he understood from news reports might happen by week\u2019s end. He declined to say when or by whom he was approached to take over as acting attorney general, and he also declined to discuss the specifics of Yates\u2019s memo.\n\nBoente is a longtime federal prosecutor who has a remarkably low-key demeanor, although he has supervised high-profile investigations and prosecutions. Assistant U.S. attorneys from his office were involved in the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, and they won the criminal convictions \u2014 which were later vacated \u2014 against former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell (R). Boente also led the prosecutions of former U.S. representative William J. Jefferson (D-La.) and former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin (D). At his swearing-in ceremony as U.S. attorney, then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch called him \u201cthat reliable middle child, the one you could always count on to be there for you.\u201d\n\nBoente would not have been first in the line of succession ordered by Obama, who had placed U.S. attorneys in the District of Columbia, Chicago and Los Angeles ahead.\n\n[Who is new acting attorney general Dana Boente?]\n\nYates\u2019s refusal to defend to Trump\u2019s immigration order \u2014 and her firing over it \u2014 capped a day in which resistance to the ban fomented inside the government and across the country.\n\nCivil rights lawyers and others across the country increased the pressure on Trump on Monday to dial back the ban \u2014 filing legal challenges to the executive order as they worked to determine whether people were still being improperly denied entry or detained. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who worked on one of the legal challenges, said of Yates\u2019s memo, \u201cIt sends a very strong message that there\u2019s something very wrong with the Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, former president Barack Obama also weighed in on the executive action through a spokesman, seeming to back those demonstrating against Trump\u2019s decree and declaring his opposition to \u201cdiscriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d\n\nObama said that he was \u201cheartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to protests at airports nationwide. He also disputed Trump\u2019s claim that his ban was based on Obama administration decisions.\n\nA Justice Department official familiar with the matter said Yates felt that she was in an \u201cimpossible situation\u201d and had been struggling with what to do about a measure she did not consider lawful. A Justice Department official confirmed over the weekend that the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel had been asked to review the measure to determine whether it was \u201con its face lawful and properly drafted.\u201d\n\nIn her memo, though, Yates said her role was broader. She wrote that an Office of Legal Counsel review does \u201cnot address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just,\u201d nor does it \u201ctake account of statements made by an administration or its surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order\u2019s purpose.\u201d\n\nThat could be a reference to Trump\u2019s campaign trail comments about a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d or the recent assertion by Trump surrogate Rudolph W. Giuliani that the president had asked him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nDemocrats criticized Yates\u2019s firing as an unfair termination of someone who was following the law. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said, \u201cWhat the Trump administration calls betrayal is an American with the courage to say that the law and the Constitution come first.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the termination \u201cunderscores how important it is to have an attorney general who will stand up to the White House when they are violating the law,\u201d and said many have doubts about Sessions.\n\nOthers, though, turned their ire on Yates.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be stated strongly enough how reckless, irresponsible and improper the behavior was of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, in refusing to defend the president\u2019s order,\u201d senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News.\n\nMiller accused Yates of \u201crefusing to defend the lawful powers of the president.\u201d He also said he had no doubt about the legality of the order.\n\nGeorge J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, said Yates\u2019s memo was a \u201cfoolish, naked political move by what appears to be an ambitious holdover official\u201d that would only create \u201cunnecessary disorder.\u201d\n\nEven with Yates gone, there remain serious questions about the implementation of the order. A lawsuit in Virginia asserted that dozens of people may have been forced to give up their green cards by Customs and Border Protection agents, although that figure could not immediately be substantiated. Lawyers in Los Angeles said they had received similar reports, though they were still exploring them.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Gelernt said that lawyers were \u201chaving trouble independently verifying anything because the government will not provide full access to all the detainees.\u201d Of particular concern, he said, was that the government had not turned over a list of detainees, as it had been ordered to do by a federal judge in New York. He said that lawyers might be back in federal court in the next day or so to forcibly get access to it.\n\n[ACLU: Delay Sessions confirmation vote until \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 is stopped]\n\nThe ACLU lawsuit in New York is perhaps the most significant of a growing number of legal challenges. The Council on American-Islamic Relations also filed a sweeping challenge Monday, alleging that the order is meant \u201cto initiate the mass expulsion of immigrant and non-immigrant Muslims lawfully residing in the United States.\u201d The lawsuit lists 27 plaintiffs, many of them lawful permanent residents and refugees who allege that Trump\u2019s order will deny them citizenship or prevent them from traveling abroad and returning home. Lawyers with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed a similar challenge in Washington state.\n\nBob Ferguson, Washington state\u2019s attorney general, also filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging broad, constitutional concerns with the order and its impact on Washington \u2014 making him the first state official to do so. That lawsuit has the support of Microsoft and Amazon.com, two companies based in Washington state. (Amazon owner Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post and has voiced Amazon\u2019s opposition to the order personally.)\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said that one lawsuit \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d and sought to minimize the action as simply subjecting 109 people to more rigorous screening. According to State Department statistics, about 90,000 people received nonimmigrant or immigrant visas in fiscal year 2015 from the seven countries affected by Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nRead more:\n\nSome international passengers entering the U.S. more easily, but members of Congress say they\u2019re still not getting answers\n\nScholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration\n\nJihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe, Rachel Weiner, Ellen Nakashima, Juliet Eilperin, John Wagner and Carol Morello contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/09/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/GQ7A77511431703991.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "The White House said Sally Yates has \u2018betrayed\u2019 the Justice Department.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky"], "keywords": ["attorney", "ordered", "trump", "yates", "justice", "presidents", "travel", "executive", "washington", "legal", "general", "dept", "department", "trumps", "ban", "order", "defend", "fired"], "tags": []}, {"title": "The Trump Effect is in full flower, and no one is immune", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-trump-effect-is-in-full-flower-and-no-one-is-immune/2017/01/31/d0364318-e7d2-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html", "text": "Less than two weeks into the presidency of Donald Trump, the center ground, to the extent it still existed, has collapsed. Trump\u2019s presidency has done more than polarize the country; it has established terms of battle likely to persist indefinitely.\n\nThe abrupt firing of acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates, after she announced that the Justice Department would not defend the administration\u2019s immigration ban in court, crystallized all that had occurred since Trump took the oath on Jan. 20. The coming fight over his Supreme Court nominee will be fiercer than before. The snowballing effect of his presidency continues at an unprecedented pace.\n\n[Trump has fired the acting attorney general who ordered Justice Dept. not to defend president\u2019s travel ban]\n\nTrump vowed to shake up Washington, shake up the federal bureaucracy and shake up the country. He is doing just that. But he has found, perhaps not to his surprise, that there is resistance on every front, resistance that is organic and widespread and that is having a cumulative effect. It can be seen almost everywhere: in the streets, in the bureaucracy he oversees, in parts of corporate America, among U.S. allies around the world and especially across social media, the most important organizing platform of our time.\n\n[Amid protests and confusion, Trump defends executive order: \u2018This is not a Muslim ban\u2019]\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates, in her office at the Justice Department on May 15, 2015, in Washington. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe effects are changing the behavior of Trump\u2019s opponents, whether they are ordinary citizens or elected officials in the Democratic Party. How much this will change the posture of Republican elected officials is a question that everyone in the Grand Old Party is grappling with day by day. Trump\u2019s presidency offers Republicans the opportunity to enact some long-sought policies and change the direction of the Supreme Court. Those benefits, however, must be weighed against the cost of allying themselves with a president as unpredictable as this one.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration, which at this point is not much more than an overworked and beleaguered White House staff aided by a few confirmed Cabinet officials, has moved swiftly to implement in some fashion his campaign promises. He might be rare among politicians, one who is prepared to keep his promises and who knows that an immediate and all-out assault on the status quo might be needed to get things moving.\n\nBut he and his team failed their first major test, with a botched rollout of one of the president\u2019s most controversial promises. The design and implementation of the immigration executive order has drawn criticism from Republicans and Democrats for its lack of clarity and for the apparent absence of proper vetting and lack of guidelines to those responsible for enforcing it.\n\nThe policy itself, predictably, has proven anathema to those who have long opposed the new president. It drew outrage when he first called for a ban on all Muslims coming into the country in December 2015. Even in modified form and language, it is still seen by Trump\u2019s critics as a Muslim ban.\n\n[Trump immigration order exposes rifts in Republican coalition]\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers have complained that the new policy has been the subject of misinterpretation and distortion. There is popular support for the concept of what Trump has called for. Securing borders is the legitimate role for the government and protecting people from threats of terrorism inside those borders is one of the government\u2019s highest obligations. Those objectives must be weighed against constitutional norms and the values of an open, democratic society. It is on those fronts that the policy \u2014 as a proxy for the Trump presidency \u2014 has ripped through the country.\n\nThe backlash within the executive branch has been particularly troubling for a businessman-president used to giving orders and having them obeyed. Yates\u2019s defiant memo guaranteed her firing and escalated the already growing warfare between the president and his critics. Both sides understood the terms at issue in that transaction and are acting with predictable and genuine outrage.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks alongside House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), protesting President Trump\u2019s ban of travelers from seven countries during a rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 30. (Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\n\nEven before Yates was dismissed, the White House had sent a stern message to others in the bureaucracy that dissent will not be welcomed. Career diplomats, using a long-standing mechanism, registered their disagreement with the new immigration ban. When asked about that Monday at his daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that, if they have a problem with the policy, \u201cThey should either get with the program or they can go.\u201d\n\nNormal rules of political jousting have gone out the window. For Democratic leaders, this is particularly important. Eight years ago, when then-President Barack Obama came to office, Republican resistance was a top-down strategy, hatched on the night of Obama\u2019s inauguration and spread through the party by its elected and other leaders.\n\nThe opposite has occurred with Trump\u2019s presidency. It has welled up and presented itself to Democratic leaders as a declaration of war. The bottom-up nature of the anti-Trump movement is best symbolized by the huge outpouring for the Women\u2019s March the day after his inauguration and then again this past weekend with protests and demonstrations springing up at airports across the country.\n\nOther signs of the resistance include the decision by various mayors to resist Trump\u2019s vow to end federal assistance to cities that protect undocumented immigrants and that the American Civil Liberties Union raised $24 million over the weekend, which is six times the amount it normally raises online in a full year. And then there is the public relations fallout on Uber after its chief executive agreed to participate in an advisory committee to the president.\n\nThe spreading message to political leaders is that cooperation with Trump will come at a cost, and Democratic leaders aren\u2019t the only ones hearing that message. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who on Friday stood in the East Room as the president declared his belief that he and she and the two countries would have an exceptional relationship, has faced mounting criticism at home for appearing too eager to become Trump\u2019s partner.\n\nDay by day, any potential bonds of trust, however tenuous, are being destroyed by an escalating tit-for-tat between the president and the opposition party. The president, responding to attacks, has taken to Twitter or in public words to belittle Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).\n\nThe result is more guerrilla warfare, with Democrats taking additional steps to delay confirmation of several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. In more normal times, both sides might slow down and wait to see how the administration shakes out.\n\nSome recalibration of tactics and strategies might still take place. But that becomes more difficult by the day. The likelihood is that the president will respond by further stirring the pot, that the Democratic opposition to Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee will be stronger and more unified that it might have been and that the lines will continue to harden. The Trump Effect is in full flower. No one is immune, and everyone is taking sides.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/31/National-Politics/Images/Botsford170131Trump11011.JPG", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "Normal rules of political combat are out the window as Trump and opponents clash.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Dan Balz"], "keywords": ["supreme", "flower", "court", "trump", "presidency", "house", "effect", "resistance", "immune", "trumps", "president", "democratic", "day"], "tags": []}, {"title": "House Judiciary chairman: Staffers had 'no control of the language' in Trump travel ban", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/31/house-judiciary-chairman-staffers-had-no-control-of-the-language-in-trump-travel-ban/", "text": "\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee pushed back Tuesday on a news report suggesting that members of his staff went behind his back to work on President Trump\u2019s executive order issued Friday barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nThe Monday evening report in Politico said that senior committee staff members \u201chelped Donald Trump\u2019s top aides draft the executive order\u201d and signed a nondisclosure agreement that would prevent them from sharing their work with members of Congress or colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut in remarks to fellow lawmakers and a press statement issued Tuesday morning, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said the staffers had his blessing to work on the Trump transition effort, much as congressional staffers of both parties have assisted this transition and previous transitions.\n\nGoodlatte said in the statement said the staffers are \u201csome of the best on Capitol Hill\u201d and are \u201cexperts in their respective fields.\u201d\n\n\u201cI proudly allowed them to provide their expertise to the Trump transition team on immigration law,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be clear, while they gave advice to the new Administration, they did not have decision making authority on the policy. The final decision was made at the highest levels of the Trump Administration, and I support the President\u2019s executive order. My staff had no control of the language contained in the President\u2019s executive order, the timing of the announcement, the rollout and subsequent implementation, and the coordination with Congress.\u201d\n\nInside the private House GOP conference meeting, Goodlatte made a similar statement, according to multiple people present, acknowledging that staff had assisted the Trump campaign and transition going back well into 2016 in adherence with ethics rules. According to the people present, Goodlatte did not leave his colleagues with the impression that the staffers had done anything wrong.\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s statement did not mention nondisclosure agreements, and a committee spokeswoman did not confirm they existed or answer questions about whether Goodlatte knew about them if they did. Media outlets, including The Washington Post, reported throughout the campaign and transition on Trump\u2019s insistence on making employees and advisers sign such agreements as a matter of course. It would be unusual for a congressional staffer to sign a nondisclosure agreement under those circumstances, said aides asked about the possible arrangement, but would not necessarily break any laws or congressional rules.\n\nWhat is not unusual is the practice of congressional aides members advising a presidential transition. The practice is routine enough that the House Ethics Committee issued guidance last year, as it has done during previous transitions, for staff members who wish to participate. The Ethics Committee memo lays out three options for staffers: provide assistance as a congressional aide, serve a \u201creimbursed detailee\u201d to the transition or take vacation or unpaid leave to serve as a volunteer.\n\nThe committee spokeswoman, Kathryn Rexrode, did not respond to questions about how the staffers in question handled their transition service.\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s aides were not the only staffers to have advised the Trump transition on immigration matters.\n\nAt least one Senate Judiciary Committee staff member was also involved as a \u201clegislative coordinator,\u201d according to a Senate GOP aide. That aide was part of a team \u201cinvolved in the drafting\u201d of immigration policy but was not involved in writing the final order issued Friday. The Senate aide added that, \u201cwhile there was knowledge that an order was being worked on, no details were shared with the committee prior to it being released.\u201d", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/04/Local-Politics/Images/House_Republicans_Ethics_81699.jpg-569bc-0538.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said staffers had his blessing to work on the Trump transition effort and did not have a say in the final executive order.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Mike DeBonis"], "keywords": ["control", "staffers", "trump", "language", "house", "travel", "transition", "judiciary", "members", "goodlatte", "statement", "chairman", "committee", "ban", "order", "congressional", "staff"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Senate Judiciary Committee spars on Sessions's nomination", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/senate-judiciary-committee-spars-on-sessionss-nomination/2017/01/31/8e5007e8-e7e3-11e6-903d-9b11ed7d8d2a_video.html", "text": "- Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed the nomination of Sen.

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal will stop referring to the countries subject to President Trump's travel ban as \u201cmajority-Muslim\u201d nations after Editor in Chief Gerard Baker said in a staff email that the term, used widely in the media, is \u201cvery loaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason they've been chosen is not because they're majority-Muslim but because they're on the list of countries Obama identified as countries of concern,\u201d Baker wrote to top editors, according to BuzzFeed, which obtained the message.\n\nBuzzFeed reported that some journalists at the newspaper are upset by Baker's order, which immediately raised eyebrows outside the Journal's newsroom, too. Baker's rationale aligns closely with White House talking points, and he recently faced criticism from fellow journalists after he said he would be reluctant to authorize use of the word \u201clie\u201d to describe false statements made by Trump.\n\nPlus, the Journal is owned by Trump supporter Rupert Murdoch, making it an easy target for accusations that it is too soft on the new president.\n\nWSJ top editor @gerardtbaker prefers to use Trump talking point to refer to countries targeted by immigration order. https://t.co/fQhkQ4oVcS \u2014 Anthony De Rosa (@Anthony) January 31, 2017\n\nWSJ editor against using \u201cmajority muslim\u201d in describing countries on travel ban, even though they are: https://t.co/YTlV6cXDNk \u2014 Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) January 31, 2017\n\nSure sounds like Gerard Baker is telling WSJ reporters to use Trump talking point in stories about the travel ban. https://t.co/HCYzgAOkyC \u2014 Ben White (@morningmoneyben) January 31, 2017\n\nIn a vacuum, Baker's directive seems consistent with his previously stated view that news outlets generally should not purport to know Trump's \u2014 or anyone's \u2014 intent. On NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this month, Baker explained his discomfort with the word \u201clie\u201d by saying that journalists \u201cstart ascribing a moral intent\u201d when they use it. It is often hard to know for sure whether a person who made a false statement intended to be deceptive or was simply wrong, which is why the media have traditionally avoided the L-word.\n\nAlthough it is factually accurate to describe the countries covered by Trump's travel ban as \u201cmajority-Muslim,\u201d the selection of that particular fact does suggest that Trump intended to target Muslims. That is presumably why Baker called the term \u201cloaded.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Baker doesn't like the idea of his reporters trying to guess what is in Trump's head \u2014 whether the president intended to deceive or intended to go after Muslims.\n\nHowever, after his appearance on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Baker wrote that \u201cif we are to use the term 'lie' in our reporting, then we have to be confident about the subject's state of knowledge and his moral intent. I can see circumstances where we might. I'm reluctant to use the term, not implacably against it.\u201d\n\nSo, Baker does believe it is sometimes possible to divine Trump's intent. What makes Baker's decision to ban use of the term \u201cmajority-Muslim\u201d hard to understand is that this is clearly one of those times.\n\nTrump's original proposal was a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d One of his top surrogates, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, reiterated in an interview on Fox News Channel on Sunday that what Trump wanted was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and that he asked a group of advisers to show him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nThe premise of the executive order Trump ultimately signed on Friday is that Muslims \u2014 not people from a handful of specific countries identified by the Obama administration \u2014 pose a threat to the United States.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) questioned whether Yates was prepared to \"say no\" to the president if necessary. Yates was fired by President Trump Jan. 30, after refusing to enforce his controversial travel ban executive order. (Monica Akhtar,Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nNow-former acting attorney general Sally Yates cemented her place in liberal lore Monday by declining to enforce President Trump's travel ban, which opponents believe is unconstitutional and un-American. And to Democrats, Trump's decision to fire her for it is proof that he's an out-of-control despot bent on running over anybody who stands in his way \u2014 the law be damned.\n\nBut is that really what happened here? The Yates firing is certainly a splashy story \u2014 stirring up all kinds of righteous indignation on the American left. But questions have arisen about just how appropriate her defiance was and how big a deal Trump's removal of her was.\n\nAfter Trump relieved Yates of her post Monday night, ProPublica President Richard Tofel weighed in with some perspective.\n\nNot a constitutional crisis for president to want his order defended. That would come if he defied court ruling that it is illegal. \u2014 Richard Tofel (@dicktofel) January 31, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, over at the Lawfare blog, Jack Goldsmith, a George W. Bush administration counsel and current Harvard law professor, argued that Yates's reasons for defying Trump's travel ban were \u201cweak.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith acknowledges that Trump's executive order banning entrants from seven majority-Muslim countries was hasty and \u201cimprudent\u201d and that Yates is within her rights to make this call. But he says her actual reason for drawing a line in the sand doesn't stand up:\n\nThe reasons that Yates then gives for deciding not to defend the EO [executive order] in court are labored and, to me, unconvincing. Most importantly, Yates does not say that she has concluded that the EO is unlawful. Nor does she say that defending the EO in court would be unreasonable. ... Yates states at the end of her letter that she is \u201cnot convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\u201d This statement summarizes the two major points above. First, she believes the standard for defending the EO is \u201cbest view of the law,\u201d not reasonable legality, and she is not convinced the EO is consistent with the best view of the law. But as noted above, the typical standard for the Attorney General to defend an EO of the President is not whether she is convinced of its legality. Rather, the standard is something closer to the idea that she should defend the EO unless she is convinced of its illegality \u2014 i.e. she defends if there is a reasonable argument for its legality. Second, Yates believes that defending the EO is inconsistent with her responsibilities to interject a policy analysis about the wisdom and justness of the EO independent of the President. For reasons stated above, I do not believe that either of these arguments are persuasive given her role. Nor are they consistent with what I understand the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney General to be.\n\nGoldsmith concludes that Yates \u201cwrote a letter that appears to depart sharply from the usual criteria that an Attorney General would apply in deciding whether to defend an EO in court. As such, the letter seems like an act of insubordination that invites the President to fire her. Which he did.\u201d\n\nThere's one key point here: Despite how her decision is being presented, Yates didn't actually say Trump's executive order isn't legal. She said she is not \u201cconvinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\u201d Yet words such as \u201cnot lawful, \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d have often been attributed to Yates. And that's a key distinction.\n\nMichael Gerhardt, a constitutional law expert at the University of North Carolina, largely agrees with Goldsmith and Tofel. He said Yates is taking an unusual stance.\n\n\u201cShe's not really stating clearly that she thinks it\u2019s unlawful; she's saying, 'I\u2019m not convinced.' \" Gerhardt said. \u201cWell, that\u2019s an odd way to formulate something.\u201d\n\nGerhardt, who has advised Democrats and served on President Bill Clinton's transition team, added that Trump's removal of Yates isn't all that exceptional.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had notable dismissals of Cabinet officials in the past, extending all the way to Andrew Jackson \u2014 if not before \u2014 so it\u2019s at least well-settled law that a president can get rid of a Cabinet member for any reason he sees fit. He's well within his authority to do this,\u201d Gerhardt said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are a lot of people jumping rather fast analogizing this to the Saturday Night Massacre. That unfolded a little differently, and the dismissals were different than these conditions. It had to do with arguable misconduct [by Richard Nixon].\u201d\n\nPeter Smith, a constitutional law expert at George Washington University, differs with Goldsmith somewhat, saying Trump's executive order may have warranted an extraordinary response. Smith said the available legal defenses of the executive order were weak and run up against \u201cthe trifecta of federal statutes, treaties and the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cA federal statute prohibits certain immigration decisions based on national origin; the United States has approved treaties requiring certain treatment of refugees; and the Constitution prohibits government action that is designed to burden members of one religious group (and to provide preferential treatment of members of a different religious group),\" Smith noted.\n\nSmith said that \u201cintuitions about the attorney general's obligations tend to turn on whose ox is being gored.\u201d\n\nAnd that's certainly a big takeaway here. The temptation on the left is to view things like what Yates did as heroic and Trump's response as petty and heavy-handed. In the face of what one side believes to be a menace \u2014 and especially religious discrimination, which is what Democrats see Trump's executive order as \u2014 any kind of resistance will be cheered.\n\nBut this is a complex legal situation \u2014 and one that invites plenty of debate.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/09/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/GQ7A77041431703989.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "Some legal experts say her case for defying Trump was weak.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Aaron Blake"], "keywords": ["eo", "law", "yates", "convinced", "executive", "attorney", "general", "complicated", "trumps", "antitrump", "legally", "president", "martyr", "sally", "order", "speaking", "movement"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Donald Trump's White House is in chaos.

(EPA/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nOn Monday night on CNN, Carl Bernstein made this proclamation: \"The president and his presidency is in chaos.\"\n\nIt's a remarkable statement given that we are only 11 days into the presidency of Donald Trump. It's also very hard to dispute.\n\nConsider this amazing \u2014 and I do mean amazing \u2014 WaPo story today about how Trump and his inner circle produced the very controversial executive order instituting a travel ban on refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The story details the infighting and blame game among Trump's top advisers and includes some eye-popping lines.\n\nAmong them:\n\n* \"Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them.\"\n\n* \u201cThe problem they\u2019ve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich of the Trump administration. (Sidebar: Gingrich is an informal adviser to Trump!)\n\n* \u201cA little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing,\u201d one White House official said of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. \u201cWe have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he\u2019s seeing shadows where there are no shadows.\u201d\n\nAny one of those lines is problematic in a normal White House. The quote from an anonymous White House official about Priebus who, let me emphasize, is the White House chief of staff, is stunning. If that line was used in \"House of Cards,\" I would roll my eyes and say it would never happen in real life.\n\nAnd, it's not just the Post story that shows the seeming tumult among Trump's senior advisers. A piece in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday details how Department of Homeland Security chief John Kelly is at odds with the White House over staffing in his organization. A Vanity Fair post details the struggles of Trump son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner as he seeks to exert influence over the president.\n\nRead any one of those stories and the word \"chaos\" jumps to mind. Or \"turmoil.\" Or \"dissension.\" All of them convey the same thing: Less than two weeks into his presidency, there is a knife fight happening daily among Trump's top aides.\n\nBernstein clearly meant his chaos comments in a negative way. Chaos, in traditional political thinking, is bad. It suggests a president who doesn't really have control over his people and a White House that resembles a roller coaster car shuddering as it travels at too high a speed down the tracks.\n\nAnd, maybe that's all true. It's possible that the Trump train is on the verge of jumping the tracks. (Mixed metaphor alert!)\n\nBut, every indication from what we know of Trump the businessman and reality TV star suggests that he revels in the chaos, that he believes the chaos produces just the sort of results he likes.\n\nThink back to the \"boardroom\" on \"The Apprentice.\" Bring everybody in. Let them attack one another and level allegations. Consult with a few of your consiglieres \u2014 George for the win! \u2014 and then make a bold and, often, unpredictable decision. Yes, that was a TV show. But it was a TV show created by Trump (and Mark Burnett). That means that the way the show worked came directly out of Trump's brain and generally speaking represents his view of how things should work.\n\nRemember that for Trump, appearances matter most. And he likes the perception of himself as the decider, the buck-stopper, the only one who can cut through all of the noise and battling egos to make the call. In order to make that image truly work, you need noise around you at all times. So Trump put in place a senior leadership team that would create it.\n\nThe other important point here is that Trump believes all of life \u2014 business and politics included \u2014 amounts to a sort of survival of the fittest/toughest. His critique of Hillary Clinton's health during the 2016 campaign was based on the idea that anyone who has a weak moment \u2014 as Clinton did at a 9/11 memorial service \u2014 can't possibly be up to the top job in the country. For Trump, the constant battles between his aides are a sort of real-life \"Survivor\" episode. The toughest SOB is the one Trump wants. And only through political combat can that be determined.\n\nThe combination of chaos, combat and constant sniping is not a bad thing in the worldview of Donald Trump. In fact, it is the one truly necessary thing.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-01-20/Bloomberg/05736295.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "Think of this White House like an episode of \"Survivor.\"", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "keywords": ["sort", "trump", "presidency", "tv", "house", "chaos", "thing", "donald", "trumps", "loves", "white", "minute"], "tags": []}, {"title": "On the death of the Senate and its long history as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/on-the-death-of-the-senate-and-its-long-history-as-the-worlds-greatest-deliberative-body/2017/01/31/b99fcbda-e73a-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html", "text": "President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nomination has the potential to do more than reshape the nation\u2019s judicial branch for years to come. It could end the Senate\u2019s long history as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\n\nLiberal and conservative activists are girding for a fight that, under current rules, gives Democrats the power to block any court nomination. But in this week\u2019s environment, with Democrats delaying Cabinet nominations and both sides calling each other names largely unheard of in the history of the Senate\u2019s genteel discourse, Republicans could take steps to eliminate that power.\n\nIf such a showdown occurs, it would be about more than ending Senate tradition of allowing an entrenched minority to stymie legislation and nominees through the filibuster.\n\nIt would be about forever changing the nature of the Senate, which the founders set up with the express goal to slow down and cool off the hasty and heated impulses more common in the House.\n\nTrump is scheduled to make his pick public Tuesday night. But long before then, some Democrats began signaling that they would attempt to filibuster the choice, whoever it is. Looming large in their minds is the Republicans\u2019 strategy through much of 2016 to block then-President Obama from filling the vacancy created after Antonin Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told reporters Monday it was \u201ca stolen seat\u201d because former president Obama\u2019s choice, Judge Merrick Garland, never even got a hearing. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has even floated the idea of a permanent filibuster until the 2020 election.\n\nLater that afternoon, conservatives fired warning shots at five Democrats facing re-election in 2018 from states that Trump won by large margins. \u201cSo this leads to an interesting conundrum for Senators like Joe Donnelly,\u201d the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to Republican leaders, wrote about the Indiana Democrat. \u201cWill he stand with the people of his state who overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump to be able to pick a Supreme Court nominee?\u201d\n\n[Democrats boycott confirmation hearings for Price and Mnuchin, blocking votes]\n\nTrump has already suggested, in an interview with Fox News last week, that Republicans should blow up the filibuster with a rules change informally known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d if Democrats successfully block his Supreme Court nominee .\n\nAt the center of this power play sits Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the self-styled institutionalist who became brutally effective at using the filibuster and all Senate procedures to impede Obama\u2019s agenda. In his own telling, other senators only began to \u201cknow who I was\u201d after his 1994 filibuster killing a campaign finance bill.\n\n\u201cThe experience was exhilarating,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, \u201cThe Long Game\u201d, \u201cand I was extremely proud to have used the rules of the Senate.\u201d\n\nMcConnell comes from a long line of filibuster supporters who believe that the maneuver, which requires 60 votes to overcome (Republicans hold just 52 seats), forces a deliberative process that usually requires the majority to find votes from the other side of the aisle and makes for more stable, lasting laws forged with bipartisan consent. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, became a landmark law cherished by both parties when 27 Republicans joined 44 Democrats to thwart a filibuster by southern senators.\n\nBut Harry Reid (D-Nev.), McConnell\u2019s predecessor as majority leader, accused McConnell of being a hypocrite who claimed to cherish the Senate\u2019s traditions and procedures but whose own actions as minority leader abused those rules to shut down agencies and commissions. By filibustering so many nominees, a few of these government bodies lacked a quorum and were unable to fully function.\n\nAfter a string of such filibusters, Reid led a party-line effort in 2013 to change the Senate rules on some votes to require simple majorities rather than 60 votes. The change applied to presidential nominees \u2014 but not to the Supreme Court.\n\nSenate procedures allow formal rule changes only with a two-thirds super majority, but Reid invoked a parliamentary trick to get around that rule.\n\nNow, with Republicans controlling both chambers and Trump in the White House, McConnell is already facing pressure from conservatives to do the same thing \u2014 and wipe out the filibuster altogether. Some House Republicans brought up that possibility at the joint GOP retreat in Philadelphia last week.\n\n[Trump close to naming nominee for Supreme Court]\n\nMcConnell returned from Philadelphia Friday and gave three interviews about the Supreme Court selection that produced three different headlines: \u201cMcConnell warns Trump to back off on killing filibuster\u201d; \u201cMcConnell all but rules out filibuster change\u201d; \u201cMcConnell guarantees Supreme Court confirmation\u201d.\n\nThe one common thread was that McConnell guaranteed the Scalia vacancy would be filled \u2014 and that the means of filling it depended on how Democrats acted. \u201cHow that occurs will depend largely on how the other side handles it,\u201d he told Morning Consult.\n\nThat\u2019s likely his way of saying that if Democrats intend to filibuster any nominee, regardless of qualifications, McConnell is willing to push his colleagues to change the rules.\n\nAt the moment, he may not have the votes to make the move, which would require 50 of his 52 Republicans to support a maneuver that they were so hostile to just three years ago when Reid executed it.\n\n\u201cI am not a proponent of changing the rules of the Senate. I hope that common sense will prevail and that we will have a normal process for considering this nominee,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters Monday evening.\n\nBut there\u2019s very little that is normal about the process now. Thousands of liberal activists gathered outside the Supreme Court Monday night at a rally opposing Trump\u2019s executive order banning refugees from around the world and foreign nationals from seven majority-Muslim nations, urging Democratic lawmakers to fight him at every turn.\n\nThe pressure on Democrats to filibuster any nominee to the high court will be tremendous. Even though 10 Democrats are up for reelection next year in states that Trump won in 2016, those Democrats know they need their own energized base to support their campaigns.\n\nOnly one Democrat seems likely to support Trump\u2019s pick at this point, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a former governor who believes in strong executive authority and who comes from a state that Trump won by 42 percentage points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a filibuster-type guy,\u201d Manchin said Monday.\n\nSome are considering delaying the bigger fight until the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 usually the court\u2019s most key swing vote \u2014 but the momentum among activists is toward constant confrontation against all Trump appointees.\n\nOur Revolution, a PAC formed by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), called on its supporters to demand Democrats force every hour of debate on every Cabinet nominee to slow up Trump\u2019s \u201creign of terror\u201d.\n\nThat type of tactics could easily force McConnell into a decision he has been able to avoid since winning the majority in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge, huge mistake in my view,\u201d he said then of the filibuster rules change. \u201cIt is hard to un-ring a bell. You know, they\u2019ve now established a precedent. It\u2019s a big issue and a big discussion.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/31/National-Politics/Images/Senate_Supreme_Court_45214.jpg-d20bb.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "With a Supreme Court nomination looming, Republicans are contemplating putting an end to the filibuster, allowing them to confirm a justice with a simple majority.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Paul Kane"], "keywords": ["body", "worlds", "supreme", "death", "court", "trump", "nominee", "senate", "republicans", "long", "rules", "greatest", "deliberative", "filibuster", "mcconnell", "democrats", "history"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Everything you want to know about the Trump Cabinet confirmation hearings, votes", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/06/everything-you-want-to-know-about-the-trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings/", "text": "Confirmation votes for President Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and other nominees have been coming fast and furious.

He is highly respected within the military establishment.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Mattis is known for making impolitic comments from time to time, such as \u201cIt\u2019s fun to shoot some people,\u201d a remark he made during a panel discussion in 2005. To lead the Pentagon, he needs a waiver from Congress bypassing a federal law that disqualifies military personnel who served on active duty in the previous seven years from becoming defense secretary. He is one of several former generals expected to join the top ranks of Trump\u2019s administration, a source of criticism for the president-elect.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is nominating Linda McMahon for administrator of the Small Business Administration. Here's what you need to know about her. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Osman Malik/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Linda McMahon\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Administrator of the Small Business Administration\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: TBA\n\nLATEST VOTE: 18-1 on Jan. 31, Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship (Russell Senate Office Building, Room S-219)\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump praised McMahon, the co-founder and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, as \u201cone of the country\u2019s top female executives advising businesses around the globe.\u201d\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Critics have alleged the WWE engaged in questionable labor practices under McMahon\u2019s leadership, including promoting steroid and painkiller abuse and requiring wrestlers to follow a grueling schedule that some say contributed to their premature deaths. Democrats who oppose her nomination say she lacks the policy knowledge to lead the SBA.\n\nBanker Steven Mnuchin is the next potential Treasury Secretary in Donald Trump's administration. Here's what you need to know about him. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Steven Mnuchin\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Treasury secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: 10 a.m. Jan. 31, Senate Committee on Finance (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 215)\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Mnuchin, a highly successful investor and former Goldman Sachs executive, \u201chas played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs,\u201d Trump said in November.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Mnuchin has no government experience and has articulated few policy views. His tenure on Wall Street seems to contradict Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on the campaign trail and has become a target for critics.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget. Here's what you need to know about the conservative congressman. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE(S): 9:40 a.m. Feb. 1, Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 342); Feb. 1, Senate Committee on the Budget\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Elected to the House in the 2010 tea party wave, Mulvaney is known as a budget policy wonk and vociferous deficit hawk, endearing him to fiscal conservatives. He has served on the House Budget, Financial Services and Oversight and Government Reform Committees.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Mulvaney campaigned for the House on a promise never to raise the debt ceiling and has voted several times against doing so, a position critics believe downplays the potentially disastrous results of a government default. Mulvaney also failed to pay more than $15,000 in state and federal payroll taxes for a household employee, according to a disclosure form obtained by The Post.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has tapped Sonny Perdue as Agriculture Secretary, rounding out his Cabinet-level picks. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue (R)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Agriculture secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nSENATE HEARING: TBA\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Perdue has a strong background in agriculture, having grown up on a farm, owned a grain and fertilizer business and trained as a veterinarian. As the former governor of Georgia, a state where farming is the largest industry, he is familiar with agricultural policy and has experience running a government bureaucracy.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Opponents believe Perdue\u2019s decisions and ties to industry will serve the interests of agribusiness and factory farming at the expense of environmental protection and animal welfare. Perdue has also made statements suggesting he is skeptical of climate change.\n\nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry leaves Trump Tower in New York on Monday, Dec. 12, 2016. (AP/Kathy Willens)\n\nWHO: Former Texas governor Rick Perry (R)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Energy secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: TBA, full Senate\n\nLATEST VOTE: 16-7 on Jan. 31, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Perry was the longest-serving governor in the history of Texas, a major oil-and-gas state.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Perry has voiced support for abolishing the Energy Department, and environmental groups worry his confirmation would mean rolling back efforts to expand renewable energy. He has also repeatedly questioned scientific findings about climate change.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be CIA director. Here's what we know about him. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: CIA director\n\nCONFIRMED? Yes.\n\nFINAL VOTE: 66-32 on Jan. 23\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Pompeo, who was elected to the House in 2010, serves on the House Intelligence Committee. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, he served as an cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company \u2014 a varied record that Trump favors. He was praised as \u201cbright and hard-working\u201d by Democratic House colleague Adam B. Schiff (Calif.).\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Pompeo has no meaningful experience in espionage. He is seen as a fierce partisan on issues such as the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the leaks by Edward Snowden, a tendency some CIA veterans fear could bias his judgment.\n\nRep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a veteran lawmaker and vehement critic of the Affordable Care Act, has been picked as President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Health and Human Services secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: 10 a.m. Jan. 31, Senate Committee on Finance (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 215)\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Price, a third-generation doctor and chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a health-care policy expert who has proposed his own alternative to Obamacare.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Critics point to Price\u2019s desire to repeal the Affordable Care Act and overhaul U.S. entitlement programs as a reason not to confirm him. Price\u2019s stock portfolio is also receiving scrutiny amid revelations he bought and sold shares in health-care companies that would be affected by legislation he worked on.\n\nScott Pruitt, attorney general of Oklahoma, arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. (John Taggart/Bloomberg News)\n\nWHO: Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt\n\nNOMINATED FOR: EPA administrator\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: 10:45 a.m. Feb. 1, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 406)\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Pruitt is an \u201cexpert in constitutional law\u201d and \u201cone of the country\u2019s top attorneys general\u201d who has a deep familiarity with federal environmental and energy regulations.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Pruitt has spent his tenure as attorney general fighting the Environmental Protection Agency. Critics point to his philosophical differences with the agency\u2019s mission as reason not to confirm him.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is nominating fast-food executive Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik,Danielle Kunitz,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Andrew Puzder\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Labor secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nSENATE HEARING: Feb. 7; Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Puzder is chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr. Trump said he has \u201ccreated and boosted the careers of thousands of Americans.\u201d\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Detractors point to Puzder\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, federal rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay and substantially raising the minimum wage to argue he should not lead the Labor Department. His ex-wife accused him of beating her \u2014 Puzder denies any physical abuse \u2014 in their 1986 divorce proceedings. He has also faced criticism for his company\u2019s use of racy and suggestive advertising.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Wilbur Ross as his nominee for commerce secretary. Here's what you need to know about the billionaire investor. (Monica Akhtar,Osman Malik,Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Wilbur Ross\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Commerce secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: TBA, full Senate\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump praised Ross, a billionaire investor who made his fortune restructuring distressed companies, as a \u201cchampion of American manufacturing\u201d and \u201cone of the greatest negotiators I have ever met.\u201d Supporters hope his experience as a turnaround specialist will boost jobs and reinvigorate troubled U.S. industries.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Ross\u2019s record of buying and restructuring troubled businesses sometimes involved layoffs and budget cuts. He is a hard-line supporter of renegotiating or withdrawing from free-trade agreements, a stance that puts him in conflict with free-market Republican orthodoxy.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Attorney general\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: 9:30 a.m. Jan. 31, Senate Judiciary Committee (Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 226)\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump has praised Sessions, a longtime adviser and supporter, as a \u201cworld-class legal mind.\u201d First elected in 1996, Sessions previously served as a U.S. attorney and attorney general for Alabama. He has earned praise from Democrats who work with him.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Accusations of racism have dogged Sessions\u2019s career. He was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after former colleagues testified he used the n-word and said the Ku Klux Klan was \u201cokay\u201d until he realized Klan members smoked marijuana.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Jan. 11 that he has picked David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Victoria Walker,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: David Shulkin\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Veterans Affairs secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nSENATE HEARING: 2:30 p.m. Feb. 1, Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Shulkin already serves as VA\u2019s Undersecretary for Health, giving him firsthand experience leading one of the department\u2019s largest administrations. He was confirmed unanimously for the job in June 2015, and prior to that, spent 30 years leading private hospitals.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Trump supporters say it is not clear Shulkin agrees with the president\u2019s desire to dramatically expand private care for veterans, and some point to ongoing problems with the Veterans Health Administration to argue he was the wrong choice. If confirmed, Shulkin would be the first VA secretary not to have served in the military.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Rex Tillerson\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Secretary of state\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: Feb. 1, full Senate\n\nLATEST VOTE: 56-43 on Jan. 30 on invoking cloture\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Trump sees Tillerson, who joined ExxonMobil in 1975 and served as its chief executive, as the \u201cembodiment of the American Dream.\u201d Trump has praised his \u201ctenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics.\u201d As a global business leader, Tillerson has experience dealing with heads of state around the world, including in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Tillerson has no experience in the public sector, received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin and brings along potential conflicts of interest from his business career. It\u2019s also unclear whether he supports sanctions implemented against Russia in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea and Moscow\u2019s support for separatists in Ukraine.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to head the Department of the Interior. Here's what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Danielle Kunitz,Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nWHO: Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.)\n\nNOMINATED FOR: Interior secretary\n\nCONFIRMED? Not yet.\n\nNEXT VOTE: TBA, full Senate\n\nLATEST VOTE: 16-6 on Jan. 31, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\nARGUMENT FOR: Zinke, an outdoor enthusiast and fifth-generation Montanan, sits on the House Natural Resources Committee. Trump praised his \u201cimpressive portfolio on Interior issues ranging from federal mineral leases to tribal affairs to public lands conservation\u201d and noted his experience and \u201cincredible leadership skills\u201d as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008.\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST: Zinke, who has spent only one term in Congress, has been widely criticized by environmental groups for opposing their agenda on issues ranging from protections for endangered species to coal extraction to gas drilling. He said during a 2014 debate that climate change is \u201cnot a hoax, but it\u2019s not proven science either.\u201d", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/11/National-Politics/Videos/Images/t_1484103538525_name_20170109_trump_thumbnail.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "Prepare for a busy couple of weeks.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Elise Viebeck"], "keywords": ["votes", "confirmation", "trump", "senate", "postwho", "washington", "cabinet", "jan", "donald", "hearings", "know", "committee", "vote", "nomination", "secretary"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Democrats boycott confirmation hearings for Price and Mnuchin, blocking votes", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-democrats-face-a-key-test-tuesday-amid-promises-to-stand-up-to-trump/2017/01/31/1685487a-e7bd-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html", "text": "Democrats intensified their opposition to President Trump on Tuesday by further delaying the confirmation of several of his Cabinet nominees amid strong Republican objections.\n\nHours after Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning certain immigrants and refugees, Democrats lashed out during a hearing held to approve his choice to lead the Justice Department. Amid concerns with information provided by his picks to lead the departments of Health and Human Services and Treasury, Democrats did not show up at another Senate committee at all.\n\nThe theatrics drew more attention to Trump\u2019s recent decisions and the growing bipartisan concern with his executive order Friday to implement a travel ban with virtually no consultation of top government officials or senior lawmakers.\n\nBut it also allowed Republicans to attack Democrats for holding up the formation of Trump\u2019s government. Ultimately, Democrats alone lack the votes needed to block any of Trump\u2019s nominees from eventually taking office \u2014 and there are no signs of Republican opposition to any of his picks.\n\nDuring a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats criticized Trump for firing Yates and said that they would not support his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), because they do not believe he would ever stand up to Trump in a similar fashion.\n\n(Monica Akhtar,Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nJust down the hallway of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the Senate Finance Committee convened to vote on Steven T. Mnuchin\u2019s nomination to serve as treasury secretary and Rep. Tom Price\u2019s nomination to be secretary of health and human services \u2014 but Democrats boycotted the meeting, forcing Republicans to reschedule both votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats once again tried and failed to stall a vote to advance Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to the full Senate amid fresh revelations that she may have plagiarized some of her answers to written questions from senators. The panel voted to refer her to the full Senate on a party-line vote.\n\n[DeVos questionnaire appears to include passages from uncited sources]\n\nAmid the rancor elsewhere, senators confirmed Elaine Chao to serve as Trump\u2019s transportation secretary by a vote of 93 to 6. And the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of former Texas governor Rick Perry to be energy secretary and Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to be interior secretary with bipartisan majorities, sending them to the full Senate for final up-or-down votes.\n\nDevelopments in the Finance Committee, however, signaled how defiant Democrats remain in stalling Trump\u2019s nominees.\n\nWhen the meeting began, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) sat alone at the dais with just three other Republican senators. Having just come from the Judiciary hearing, Hatch told his colleagues, \u201cJeff Sessions isn\u2019t treated much better than these fellas are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of this is just because they don\u2019t like the president,\u201d Hatch said, later adding that Democrats \u201cought to stop posturing and acting like idiots.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) agreed. \u201cI think this is unconscionable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe did not inflict this kind of obstructionism on President Obama,\u201d added Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), the only other senator in the room. He added that the Democrats were committing \u201ca completely unprecedented level of obstruction. This is not what the American people expect of the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nBut just four years ago, Republicans similarly boycotted a Senate committee\u2019s vote on Gina McCarthy to serve as President Barack Obama\u2019s interior secretary. Senators said at the time that she had refused to answer their questions about transparency in the agency.\n\nOther walkouts have happened, most famously in 2003, when Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, dispatched U.S. Capitol Police officers to find Democrats who left a hearing where Republicans were trying to pass a pension bill. He later apologized for his heavy-handed tactics on the House floor.\n\nShortly before the Finance hearing began, committee Democrats huddled in the office of the panel\u2019s ranking member, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and agreed that they would all boycott the session, aides said.\n\nThe boycott was prompted by Democrats\u2019 concerns that Mnuchin initially misstated his personal wealth on financial disclosure forms and misstated how OneWest Bank, a bank he led as chairman and chief executive officer, scrutinized mortgage documents. Democrats have also raised questions about Price and his personal financial investments in health-care companies and legislation he promoted that could have benefited several of the same companies. Some of the stock trades, as well as campaign donations from companies, closely coincided with one another.\n\nA series of stock buys the lawmaker made in an Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, has brought scrutiny for weeks. In 2016, he received a discounted price for his purchases as part of a private offering made to only a certain number of investors; the questions have been whether he received certain insider information from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a company board member and its largest investor, and whether he got a special price when he bought $50,000 to $100,000 in shares last year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Price received a \u201cprivileged\u201d offer that he had mischaracterized in the hearings when he said such offers \u201cwere available to every single individual that was an investor at the time.\u201d\n\nInnate Immunotherapeutics chief executive Simon Wilkinson told The Washington Post Monday that the SEC places some restrictions on who can receive such offerings. However, Wilkinson said Price received the same 12 percent discount as about 620 shareholders in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. He also said Price was one of 20 Americans in that group, all of whom fit the definition of \u201ca sophisticated or accredited investor.\u201d\n\nStanding outside his office as the markup was to begin, Wyden told reporters that Price\u2019s statements contradicted those by Wilkinson and other company officials.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum,\u201d Wyden said, \u201cI believe the committee should postpone this vote and talk to company officials.\u201d\n\nMuch of the drama of Tuesday morning unfolded along a fluorescent-lit hallway on the second floor of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Wyden and fellow Democrats announced their plans to forego the finance panel\u2019s vote to a pack of reporters situated near Wyden\u2019s office and the committee room where angry Republicans fumed. A few steps away was the Judiciary Committee room, where Sessions\u2019s future was being debated and where at least pair of protesters were removed.\n\nShuttling between the two committees, Hatch told reporters he had no idea Democrats had planned to protest his hearing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the most pathetic things I\u2019ve seen in my whole time in the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.), added that the Democratic boycott of Price would make it difficult for Republicans to enact crucial elements of their agenda like revamping the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt gets a lot harder; we need him there,\u201d Thune said.\n\nIn the Judiciary hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and other Democrats strongly defended Yates against Trump\u2019s claim that she had betrayed the Justice Department.\n\nYates\u2019s defiance of Trump \u201ctook guts,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThat statement said what an independent attorney general should do. That statement took a steel spine to have the courage to say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no confidence that Sen. Sessions will do that,\u201d she added. \u201cInstead, he has been the fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter in Congress of the Trump agenda.\u201d\n\nRepublicans defended Sessions, but said little about Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nIn the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Democrats tried postponing the vote on DeVos, complaining she had just submitted written responses to hundreds of questions on Monday night. Democrats discovered that some of those responses appeared to use several sentences and phrases from other sources without attribution \u2014 including from a top Obama administration civil rights official.\n\n[Here are Betsy\u2019s DeVos\u2019s answers to 139+ questions from Democratic Sen. Murray]\n\nThe panel then toiled over the actual vote on DeVos\u2019s nomination, with Democrats complaining that it shouldn\u2019t count because Hatch \u2014 a member of the committee who was simultaneously dealing with events in the Judiciary and Finance meetings \u2014 was allowed to submit a proxy vote. Without him in the room, the 23-member committee would have deadlocked. After a recess and several minutes of heated argument, Republicans ordered a revote with Hatch in the room and approved DeVos along party lines, 12 to 11.\n\nAmid growing public concern with Trump\u2019s travel ban, Democrats have faced louder calls from within their party to boldly confront the new administration. But further delays could have far-reaching consequences, as became evident on Monday night when the Justice Department was plunged into turmoil.\n\nTrump fired Yates, an Obama-era appointee, for refusing to defend his travel ban in federal court. In her place Trump installed Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who is expected to hold the job until Sessions is confirmed as attorney general.\n\nWhile senators toil over the qualifications and positions of Trump\u2019s nominees, he has started meeting with world leaders, reshaping immigration and trade policy and tasked congressional Republicans with overhauling the nation\u2019s health-care system \u2014 with most of the seats around the White House Cabinet Room still empty.\n\nSchumer was unapologetic on Monday, telling the Spanish-language network Univision that \u201cSenate Democrats, we\u2019re the accountability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Donald Trump accountable,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cWe\u2019re not letting him rush the Cabinet through.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost\n\nKaroun Demirjijan, Kelsey Snell and Kimberly Kindy contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/31/National-Politics/Images/AFP_L93UH.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "The move effectively stalls the confirmation process.

This is harder than it sounds: Because we conduct elections at the county level and congressional districts sprawl around states in whatever way best ensures partisan control, matching up those two sets of data requires a lot of close attention being paid to random precincts.\n\nDoing so, though, allows us to get a more complete picture of the extent to which U.S. voters split their tickets in 2016. In other words, we can now see where districts voted for a member of one party for Congress and the presidential candidate of the other party.\n\nOver time, the number of places that have done that has declined. We looked at this in 2014, using data from Polidata and past Daily Kos analysis. This allowed us to see how split-ticket voting has evolved since 1992.\n\nConsider this chart, contrasting congressional and presidential votes this year.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nIf every congressional district were won by members of the House and presidential candidates of the same party and margin, every dot would fall on that yellow diagonal line. A lot come close! Dots above the line saw a wider margin for the Republican in the congressional race; those below, a wider margin for the Democrat. The region that\u2019s blue indicates districts where the Democrat won both races. The red region shows the Republican winning both.\n\nNotice that most of the dots fall into one of those regions. Most voters, in other words, voted for the same party to hold the House seat and the presidency. But not all. The dots in the upper left and lower right quadrants split their tickets.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how that\u2019s evolved over time. Notice how the dots are increasingly clustered around the yellow line as we look back at election results.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nFor off-year elections, we compare congressional results with the preceding presidential election. So notice what happens in 2010, for example: More dots above the yellow line as Republicans fared much better in congressional races.\n\nIt can be hard to see precisely how many districts split their votes in that animation, though. So here\u2019s a simple graph of ticket-splitting in each congressional election since Bill Clinton won in 1992.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nYou see far fewer light-colored bar areas this year than 20 years ago. Not an all-time low in our data set, but close. (The low was 2012.) This isn\u2019t necessarily all because of split-ticket voting, mind you. Some voters may have gone out to vote for the member of Congress that they liked, but then skipped voting in the presidential race. But the effect is the same: a district that\u2019s a dichotomy.\n\nSo where were those split districts this year? Here.\n\n(An earlier version of this map didn\u2019t render properly. It has been updated.)\n\nHillary Clinton picked up districts in California, Washington and New York won by Republican members of the House, though she would have won those states anyway. Donald Trump picked up districts in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin \u2014 in the region that powered his surprise electoral victory. Clinton overperformed in cities in Texas, narrowing the margin there relative to how then-President Obama did in 2012, but she didn\u2019t come close to winning the state. (Although the final margin there was narrower than in Iowa.) That\u2019s the big picture of the 2016 election: Clinton doing better in places with a lot of votes, leading her to a popular vote victory. But Trump doing better where it matters.\n\nSplit ticket voting doesn\u2019t happen very often any more. In 2016, though, where it happened was important \u2014 to Clinton\u2019s detriment.", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/01/SplitDists_v2.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "A look at ticket-splitting since 1992.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Philip Bump"], "keywords": ["tickets", "dots", "voting", "won", "places", "explain", "congressional", "washington", "thats", "districts", "ones", "split", "parties", "2016", "margin", "presidential", "election"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Democrats boycott Senate hearing for Mnuchin, Price", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/democrats-boycott-senate-hearing-for-mnuchin-price/2017/01/31/5f081c16-e7d7-11e6-903d-9b11ed7d8d2a_video.html", "text": "- Democrats boycotted a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee in which Steven Mnuchin, President Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, and Rep.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly will huddle with congressional leaders on Capitol Hill Tuesday afternoon, following a bipartisan backlash to President Trump\u2019s executive order halting refugee entries and banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nRepublican and Democratic committee leaders have been invited to the closed-door meeting with Kelly, according to Democrats familiar with the plan. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said he has already communicated directly with Kelly and will not be attending.\n\nKelly is one of several of Trump\u2019s chosen Cabinet members who were reportedly unaware of the details of the executive order before Trump signed it \u2014 a revelation that many members of Congress found perplexing.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers were irate that Trump did not warn them about the executive order, despite promises to keep them in the loop about major policy moves. Many complained that the order was \u201ctoo broad,\u201d especially in targeting legal permanent residents who happened to be out of the country, and in its apparent focus on Muslims \u2014 despite the administration\u2019s protestations that the order was not a Muslim ban.\n\n[From order to disorder: How Trump\u2019s immigration directive exposed GOP rifts]\n\nKelly released a statement over the weekend announcing that allowing U.S. green card holders to enter the country was \u201cin the national interest\u201d and that absent \u201csignificant\u201d information to the contrary that indicates a threat to public safety, someone\u2019s lawful permanent residency should allow them re-entry into the United States on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNonetheless, lawmakers still want to Kelly to detail how he intends to implement the order \u2014 a point Democratic committee ranking members stressed in a letter they sent to him Sunday night, as reported by Politico, asking for an \u201cemergency meeting.\u201d Since then, Trump has fired acting attorney general Sally Yates, who ordered the Justice Department not to defend the executive order over concerns it might not be lawful.\n\nThe Tuesday meeting may not satisfy others on the Hill who want their own audience with Kelly to demand answers. On Monday, a group of Democratic senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee also sent Kelly a letter asking for an emergency meeting with the homeland security chief to discuss \u201cyour plans to implement President Trump\u2019s order\u201d as it pertains to legal permanent residents and the use of a religious criteria to determine who is allowed entry into the United States.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/25/Cops-Courts/Images/632685636.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "DHS chief John Kelly heads to the Hill after lawmakers demanded an audience to grill him about how he would implement Trump's order on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian"], "keywords": ["executive", "united", "leaders", "meeting", "congressional", "immigration", "states", "chief", "trumps", "kelly", "president", "security", "dhs", "order", "talk", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"title": "The Daily 202: Trump sacking acting A.G. raises new questions about his respect for the rule of law", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/01/31/daily-202-trump-sacking-acting-a-g-raises-new-questions-about-his-respect-for-the-rule-of-law/588feeb8e9b69b432bc7e09d/", "text": "With Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Back in 2015, when the idea of Donald Trump in the Oval Office seemed far-fetched, Jeff Sessions wanted to know whether Sally Yates was willing to stand up to the president.\n\n\u201cYou have to watch out, because people will be asking you to do things you just need to say no about,\u201d the Alabama senator told her during her confirmation hearing to become deputy attorney general. \u201cDo you think the attorney general has the responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that's improper? A lot of people have defended the [Loretta] Lynch nomination, for example, by saying: 'Well, he appoints somebody who's going to execute his views. What's wrong with that?' But if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, I believe that the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has the obligation to follow the law and the Constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president,\u201d Yates said.\n\nSessions, who will soon be attorney general, circled back to the issue: \u201cLike any CEO, with a law firm \u2014 sometimes the lawyers have to tell the CEO: 'Mr. CEO, you can't do that. Don't do that. We'll get us sued. It's going to be in violation of the law. You'll regret it, please.' No matter how headstrong they might be. Do you feel like that's the duty of the attorney general's office?\u201d\n\nYates assured him: \u201cI do believe that that's the duty of the attorney general's office, to fairly and impartially evaluate the law and to provide the president and the administration with impartial legal advice.\u201d\n\nJust as it turns out Trump literally meant what he said on the campaign trail and planned to follow through, last night Yates was true to her word. The acting attorney general ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend his immigration order temporarily banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. She was promptly fired.\n\n-- Trump\u2019s order was reviewed by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel before it was issued. But Yates said in a memo explaining her decision that the OLC failed to take into account intent, which is relevant in a court of law. Over the weekend, Rudy Giuliani (who is lunching with the president today) went on Fox News to say that Trump told him he wanted to have a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and requested that the former New York mayor work with experts to show him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d (Any kind of religious test would be plainly unconstitutional.)\n\n-- Trump\u2019s move last night, while legally defensible, raises fresh questions about the president\u2019s commitment to the rule of law. It follows several episodes during the campaign that were far outside American norms.\n\nRecall when he said that a federal district judge, Gonzalo Curiel, could not properly adjudicate a fraud lawsuit against Trump University because his parents were born in Mexico. (Paul Ryan called this the textbook definition of a racist statement.)\n\nAt a debate in October, Trump said he would \u201cinstruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look\u201d into Hillary Clinton if he got elected. \u201cIt's awfully good someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Clinton said. To which Trump replied, \u201cBecause you'd be in jail.\u201d\n\nIt is against the law to waterboard terrorism suspects, yet Trump suggested several times last week that he might still order it.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia's bench chair is draped in black after his death. (Franz Jantzen/Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)\n\n-- The decision to fire Yates also raises profound questions about Trump\u2019s view of the judiciary as an independent branch of government. Firing Yates gives Democrats more fodder to rigorously scrutinize whomever Trump announces tonight at 8 p.m. as his pick for the Supreme Court. What kind of conversations has the president had with this person? Did he ask him to make any commitments about anything? Would Trump stop himself, or would anyone on his staff stop him, from calling this justice directly to complain about something he doesn\u2019t like or to press him on a case that\u2019s before the high court?\n\nTrump was asked during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last spring what kind of person he\u2019d pick to replace Antonin Scalia. His answer? Someone who \u201cwould look very seriously at (Hillary\u2019s) email disaster.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d probably appoint people that would look very seriously at her email disaster because it\u2019s a criminal activity, and I would appoint people that would look very seriously at that to start off with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou talk about a case. Now that\u2019s a real case. If she\u2019s able to get away with that, you can get away with anything.\u201d\n\nJudges in our system have nothing to do with investigating or prosecuting crimes, of course, but it\u2019s not clear Trump understood that when he made the comment.\n\nPresident Trump speaks on the phone with the prime minister of Australia in the Oval Office on Saturday. Note the portrait behind him. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\n-- Trump said last month that he would not name his Supreme Court pick until after Sessions was confirmed as attorney general. Sessions has cleared the Judiciary Committee yet, let alone the full Senate, but Trump is going forward with the announcement. Last week, Trump said he would make the announcement on Thursday. Then he moved it up to Tuesday. Sean Spicer was asked why during his briefing yesterday. \u201cBecause he wanted to,\u201d the press secretary said.\n\nThat\u2019s a refreshingly honest answer in some ways, but it also encapsulates Trump\u2019s approach to the presidency thus far.\n\nTrump has hung a portrait of Andrew Jackson next to his desk in the Oval Office, the latest data point to show how he sees himself as the natural heir to the Jacksonian tradition. In 1832, when the Supreme Court struck down a Georgia law that allowed for the seizure of Cherokee lands, both the state and Jackson just ignored it. It\u2019s possibly apocryphal, but the seventh president is purported to have said: \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision. Now let him enforce it.\u201d\n\nJeff Sessions is sworn in during his confirmation hearing to be attorney general on Jan. 10. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\n-- Last night\u2019s donnybrook makes it very hard for any Senate Democrat, with the possible exception of Joe Manchin, to confirm Sessions when he comes up for a vote on the floor. The blowback from the base and leadership would be intense.\n\n-- Sessions has been the intellectual godfather of all Trump\u2019s hard-line actions thus far. Robert Costa and Philip Rucker have a fantastic story about his influence: \u201cThe author of many of Trump\u2019s executive orders is senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, a Sessions confidant who was mentored by him and who spent the weekend overseeing the government\u2019s implementation of the refugee ban. The tactician turning Trump\u2019s agenda into law is deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn, Sessions\u2019s longtime chief of staff in the Senate. The mastermind behind Trump\u2019s incendiary brand of populism is chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who, as chairman of the Breitbart website, promoted Sessions for years. Then there is Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who considers Sessions a savant and forged a bond with the senator while orchestrating Trump\u2019s trip last summer to Mexico City and during the darkest days of the campaign.\n\nBannon emailed The Post that Sessions as \u201cthe clearinghouse for policy and philosophy\u201d in Trump\u2019s administration, saying he and the senator are at the center of Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-America movement\u201d and the global nationalist phenomenon: \u201cWhat we are witnessing now is the birth of a new political order, and the more frantic a handful of media elites become, the more powerful that new political order becomes itself.\u201d\n\n-- Keep in mind: Because he knows he has the votes to get confirmed, Sessions has repeatedly declined to recuse himself from potential Justice Department investigations into Trump, his family and his aides \u2013 on anything from conflicts of interest to potential Russia connections. The incoming AG\u2019s close personal and professional ties would raise questions about his willingness to challenge the president.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n\nWith contributions from Elise Viebeck (@eliseviebeck).

He told The Post that he will agree to enforce the immigration order, and he was sworn in about 9 p.m. on Monday. Rachel Weiner reports: \u201cBoente, a 33-year veteran of the Justice Department, most recently oversaw the prosecution of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell \u2014 a case ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court. Lawyers who have known Boente \u2026 said he has a reputation for being tough but even handed. While he has not been vocal about his political views, they said, he would not have agreed to be thrust into the role of defending President Trump\u2019s controversial executive order banning some migrants unless he believed it was legally sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an interview, Boente noted his office already had been supporting the president\u2019s order in a challenge brought in Virginia federal court[:] \u2018I was enforcing it this afternoon,\u2019 Boente said. 'Our career department employees were defending the action in court, and I expect that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do tomorrow, appropriately and properly.'\"\n\n-- REACTION FROM THE HILL: House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) declined to criticize Yates, saying her decision on the executive order was likely similar \u201cto an evaluation we all made.\" \"And that was it did not appear to be specific in nature,\" the Texas Republican said. \"So it may be a matter of clarity it may be a matter of illegality to him, it may be a matter of several things. It did not look as complete and succinct as what I think I would've wanted.\"\n\n-- HOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS MESSAGING: Stephen Miller went on Fox News to attack Yates: \u201cIt can\u2019t be stated strongly enough how reckless, irresponsible and improper the behavior was of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, in refusing to defend the president\u2019s order,\u201d he said, accusing her of \u201crefusing to defend the lawful power of the president.\u201d He added that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d about the legality of the order.\n\n-- Trump himself tweeted twice this morning:\n\nNancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017\n\nWhen will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017\n\nTrump, flanked by Mike Pence and John Kelly, speaks at DHS HQ last week. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nTHE FALLOUT INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE REFUGEE BAN:\n\n-- TICK TOCK on how Trump\u2019s immigration order took the GOP from order to disorder, via Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Robert Costa: \u201cInside the West Wing, tensions flared as differences in management style emerged between two factions: one led by [Bannon and Miller], who wrote the immigration order, and the other composed of [Reince Priebus] and his deputies, who are accustomed to operating with a more traditional chain of command. Miller, 31, was the public face of the order and the populist wing of the White House over the weekend, directing department and agency chiefs as well as explaining and defending the move \u2026\n\n\u201cAs it became evident that the rollout of the executive order bordered between clumsy and dysfunctional, people in Trump\u2019s orbit divided over who was at fault, with some blaming Miller. Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge \u2026 \u2018The problem they\u2019ve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway,\u2019 said Trump ally Newt Gingrich.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, Trump\u2019s leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials \u2014 Bannon and Miller chief among them \u2014 are actively shaping policy and guiding the president\u2019s decisions. Others \u2014 such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and [Spicer] \u2014 function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions. The competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues\u2019 motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence.\"\n\n-- At least three top national security officials \u2014 Jim Mattis at Defense, John Kelly at DHS and Rex Tillerson at State \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of the directive until around the time Trump signed it. From the Associated Press\u2019s Julie Pace and Eric Tucker: \u201cLeading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark. \u2026 Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday\u2019s signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed. A senior U.S. official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump\u2019s order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president\u2019s political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order.\u201d\n\n-- Kelly has clashed with the Trump administration over staffing and other decisions in recent days, leaving the agency without a second-in-command as it tried to institute a new travel ban during a chaotic weekend at U.S. airports. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Damian Paletta and Aruna Viswanatha report: \u201cWhen [Trump] selected Mr. Kelly, the pick won broad support from Republicans and Democrats in part because they believed the retired Marine general would be willing to speak up and challenge Mr. Trump. That tension didn\u2019t take long to materialize. Mr. Kelly hasn\u2019t been able to name the deputy he wants at the agency, people familiar with the matter said, and he fought off attempts by the White House to put Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state known as a hard-liner on immigration, into the position. Mr. Kelly was also frustrated at not knowing the details of the travel ban earlier, so he could prepare his agency to respond, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d\n\n-- Dozens of State Department diplomats have signed on to a \u201cdissent channel\u201d document expressing opposition to the ban and expressing the view that it \u201cwill not achieve its aim of making our country safer.\u201d The dissent channel is a mechanism by which State Department employees can express policy disagreements without fear of retribution, Abby Phillip explains. But Sean Spicer delivered a stern message to dissenters, suggesting that the \u201ccareer bureaucrats\u201d who disagreed with the order should not continue to serve in the government: \u201cEither get with the program or they can go,\u201d he said. Asked to clarify whether he was suggesting that public servants who disagree with the president should leave their posts, Spicer doubled down. \u201cIf somebody has a problem with that agenda, then that does call into question whether ... they should continue in that post or not,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress gather on the Supreme Court steps during a news conference about Trump's executive orders. (AP/Alex Brandon)\n\nTHE POLITICAL FALLOUT:\n\n-- Democrats have all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with Trump following his newly-implemented travel ban, while Republicans accused him of leaving them in the dark before signing the controversial order. Ed O'Keefe, Sean Sullivan and Kelsey Snell report: \u201cSeizing on growing public outcry \u2026 Democrats on Capitol Hill launched what they said would be a protracted fight on several fronts. It will include public protests against the ban, delaying Cabinet confirmations and an attempt to reject Trump\u2019s pick to serve on the [Supreme Court]. The plans represent a sharp pivot in Democratic strategy after weeks of vowing to work with Trump. ;We should be using our time on the floor to talk about the dangerous consequences to U.S. national security,' said Sen. Christopher Murphy. 'We can take a pause in confirmation votes to try to get this executive order right. You know this is going to get Americans killed if we don\u2019t take our time to understand what this order is and what its consequences are.'\"\n\nThe ban also significantly deepened fissures in Trump\u2019s already-fragile relationship with Congressional Republicans: GOP leaders complained they were not consulted before Trump issued his order \u2013 and at least a dozen key Republicans said the order \u201ctook them by surprise.\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said he was not briefed beforehand: \u201cI know that they said they talked with some staffers on the Hill \u2014 not in our office,\u201d Corker said. Asked whether he was consulted in the drafting of the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said simply: \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n-- It turns out several senior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee secretly helped draft the order without informing their own party leadership. Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade, Jake Sherman, and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cLike other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law,\u201d a House Judiciary Committee aide said. \u201cHowever, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll out and implementation.\u201d It\u2019s rare for White House officials to circumvent congressional leadership to deal directly with committee aides \u2013 and in another bizarre twist, they also had to sign nondisclosure agreements. Their work reportedly began after the election and before Trump was sworn in.\n\n-- Barack Obama weighed in publicly for the first time since leaving office, criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration ban and praising the surge of demonstrations and political activism that has broken out across the country in response. \u201cThe President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\" Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement. He also rejected comparison of Trump\u2019s ban to his 2011 policy, which temporarily slowed the processing of Iraqi refugees. (The Post\u2019s Fact Checker gave Trump three Pinocchios for this claim.)\n\n\u201c[His] decision to speak out \u2014 after pledging to do so in rare instances \u2014 underscores the predicament he and many of his top advisers find themselves in just days after leaving the White House,\u201d Juliet Eilperin explains. \u201cWhile the president repeatedly emphasized the need to ensure a smooth transition and not interfere with the workings of the new administration, the adoption of a policy antithetical to the values he espoused while in office caused him to break his silence.\u201d\n\nTHE MORAL FALLOUT:\n\n-- The leader of the conservative Southern Baptist Convention, Russell Moore, penned an open letter to Trump saying that his church is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the ban and called on the president to affirm his administration's \"commitment to religious freedom and the inalienable human dignity of persecuted people.\" \u201cAchieving the right balance between compassion toward refugees \u2014 one of the most vulnerable groups of people among us \u2014 and protection of Americans is crucial if the United States is to remain a model for freedom around the world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is one thing to debate whether the vetting process is adequate. It is quite another to seek to potentially turn our backs on Syrian refugees permanently.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cMany Republican members of Congress have made a Faustian bargain with [Trump],\u201d writes New York Times columnist David Brooks. \u201cThey don\u2019t particularly admire him as a man, they don\u2019t trust him as an administrator, they don\u2019t agree with him on major issues, but they respect the grip he has on their voters, they hope he\u2019ll sign their legislation and they certainly don\u2019t want to be seen siding with the inflamed progressives or the hyperventilating media. Their position was at least comprehensible: How many times in a lifetime does your party control all levers of power? When that happens you\u2019re willing to tolerate a little Trumpian circus behavior in order to get things done. But if the last 10 days have made anything clear, it\u2019s this: The Republican Fausts are in an untenable position. The deal they\u2019ve struck with the devil comes at too high a price. It really will cost them their soul.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cEvery U.S. president since World War II has disagreed with the stunted and self-defeating view of the country now held by Trump,\u201d says Post columnist and former Bush adviser Michael Gerson, who calls the travel ban a \u201cpicture of American shame.\u201d \u201cOver the past century \u2014 in some ways from the beginning \u2014 the United States has been a cheerfully abnormal nation. American identity (in this view) is not based mainly on blood or soil, but rather on the patriotic acceptance of a unifying creed. And the United States has often accepted refugees, reflecting its deepest values and building reserves of trust and respect. This is the difference a creed can make: When Ronald Reagan spoke on foreign policy, tyrants sat uneasy on their thrones and dissidents and refugees took heart. When Donald Trump speaks on foreign policy, tyrants rest easier and dissidents and refugees lose hope. Trump came to power promising that masterful leadership would replace the \u2018stupid\u2019 kind. This action was malicious, counterproductive and inept \u2014 the half-baked work of amateurs who know little about security, little about immigration law and nothing about compassion.\u201d\n\n-- The Atlantic, \u201cHow to Build an Autocracy,\u201d by David Frum: \u201cIf this were happening in Honduras, we\u2019d know what to call it. It\u2019s happening here instead, and so we are baffled. Everything imagined above\u2014and everything described below\u2014is possible only if many people other than Donald Trump agree to permit it. It can all be stopped, if individual citizens and public officials make the right choices. The story told here, like that told by Charles Dickens\u2019s Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, is a story not of things that will be, but of things that may be. Other paths remain open. It is up to Americans to decide which one the country will follow.\u201d\n\n-- Thousands of leading academics \u2013 including 40 Nobel laureates \u2013 signed a petition denouncing Trump\u2019s executive order as discriminatory and \u201cfatally disruptive\u201d to immigrants, communities, and families affected by the ban. \u201cIt is inhumane, ineffective, and un-American,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nSyrian children play in a makeshift refugee camp in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. (Getty)\n\nTHE HUMAN FALLOUT:\n\n-- The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 20,000 people in precarious conditions would be banned from traveling to the U.S. under Trump's directive. From the New York Times\u2019 Somini Sengupta, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush: In a statement, the agency said it was \u201calarmed at the impact\u201d of the executive order. Those who are referred for resettlement, it said, \u201care the most vulnerable \u2014 such as people needing urgent medical assistance, survivors of torture, and women and girls at risk. The new homes provided by resettlement countries are lifesaving for people who have no other options.\u201d\n\n-- Some refugees awaiting medical care had expedited application processing \u2013 and now, aid officials say the prolonged wait could be their death sentence. Our Africa bureau chief Kevin Sieff tells their stories: \u201cOne is a 9-year-old Somali child in Ethiopia with a congenital heart disease that cannot be treated in a refugee camp. Another is a 1-year-old Sudanese boy with cancer. A third is a Somali boy with a severe intestinal disorder living in a camp that doesn\u2019t even have the colostomy bags he needs. After [Trump\u2019s] executive order \u2026 their resettlement in America was put on hold. Now, the organization responsible for processing refugees in sub-Saharan Africa, Church World Service, says that order could be their death sentence.\u201d\n\nMany on the list had begun to leave the refugee camps before the ban went into effect -- such as a severely ill 38-year-old widow and mother of seven. Like many, she had given away her tent and humanitarian supplies before departing. Now, if forced to return to the refugee camp, they will be treated as new arrivals \u2013 waiting all over again to receive a card entitling them to rations or shelter. Because many of the refugees\u2019 U.S. clearances will expire during the 120-day suspension, it could take them months or even years to get to re-complete the process a second time.\n\n-- The ramifications of Trump\u2019s travel ban are even having a spillover effect on European dual nationals, where thousands of citizens of U.S.-allied nations could also be barred from traveling to America. The news prompted a fresh wave of outrage and confusion that threatened to open an early rift across the Atlantic. Anthony Faiola reports: \u201cFollowing instructions from the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. embassies in Berlin and Paris warned Monday that German and French citizens who are also dual nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 the seven mostly Muslim nations targeted by the ban \u2014 would fall under the travel ban, joining people who hold passports only from those countries. The Trump administration, however, may be favoring the dual nationals of some Western nations \u2014 a turn of events that could further complicate the White House\u2019s already floundering relations with Europe[:] After talks with the White House, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, for instance, reassured his nation Monday that dual British nationals of the flagged Muslim nations have received an \u2018exemption\u2019 from the travel ban.\"\n\n-- This story is breaking through. The headline on the front page of the Commercial Appeal in Memphis is: \u201cHow Trump\u2019s ban puts St. Jude patient\u2019s family in limbo.\u201d\n\nTHE DIPLOMATIC FALLOUT:\n\n-- The travel ban is intensifying anti-American backlash in Iraq, threatening Washington\u2019s relationship with its main partner in battling the Islamic State. The Iraqi parliament voted for a reciprocal ban on visas for Americans. Loveday Morris and Mustafa Salim report: \"The Iraqi lawmakers\u2019 decision is subject to government ratification, but it underscores the growing resentment over a U.S. executive order that imposed visa restrictions on Iraqis and citizens of six other Muslim-majority nations. In a terse statement, Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari described the ban as unreasonable, given that Iraq is sacrificing the \u201cblood of its sons\u201d in the front-line fight against ISIS, and urged the U.S. to consider. About 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq to train and assist Iraqi forces, which are close to forcing ISIS militants from their stronghold in Mosul. Given the two countries\u2019 close military cooperation on the Mosul offensive, Trump\u2019s decision to impose visa restrictions has drawn particular ire in Iraq. [And] exacerbating that anger, many Iraqis hold the United States responsible for their lack of security because of its 2003 invasion.\"\n\n-- One sad example: A four-star Iraqi general who commands elite American-trained counter terrorist forces in the battle against ISIS has been kept from entering the U.S., where his family has been relocated for their safety. He\u2019d had plans to visit them next week, CBS News reports, until he was told not to bother. \u201cI have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning,\u201d he said. \u201cNow my kids are now asking if I\u2019m a terrorist.\u201d\n\n-- A petition calling on Britain to cancel Trump\u2019s state visit has more 1 million signatures, pushing the issue onto the Parliament\u2019s agenda amid furor in London over Trump\u2019s ban. The petition is currently the second-most signed initiative on Parliament\u2019s website. (Karla Adam)\n\n-- Bigger picture, America\u2019s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends. The New York Times\u2019 Peter S. Goodman reports: \u201cThey have heard the mantra \u2018America First\u2019 from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump\u2019s denigration of the [E.U.] and his apparent esteem for [Putin]. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world. Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. [Now] many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs \u2026\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that America is our best friend,\u201d said Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. \u201cIf that\u2019s no longer the case, if that\u2019s what we need to understand from [Trump], then of course Europe will look for new friends.\u201d\n\nTom Price testifies before the Senate Finance Committee last week.

Grimaldi reports: \u201cThe Georgia Republican \u2026 testified in his Senate confirmation hearings on Jan. 18 and 24 that the discounted shares he bought in Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., an Australian medical biotechnology company, \u2018were available to every single individual that was an investor at the time.\u2019 In fact, the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares of the company\u2014an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose from an invitation from a company director and fellow congressmen.\"\n\nHAPPENING TONIGHT:\n\n-- President Trump will announce his Supreme Court nominee in prime-time.

Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett reports: He said in a Monday morning interview that he will filibuster any pick that is not Merrick Garland, adding that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of his caucus will oppose Trump\u2019s nomination. \u201cThis is a stolen seat. This is the first time a Senate majority has stolen a seat,\u201d Merkley said. \u201cWe will use every lever in our power to stop this \u2026 I will definitely object to a simple majority.\u201d On Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also reminded her Twitter followers that Supreme Court nominees can still be blocked by the Senate minority, unlike all other executive and judicial nominees. And Chuck Schumer has said he will fight \"tooth and nail\" any nominee who isn't \"mainstream.\"\n\nMORE ON THE TRUMP TAKEOVER:\n\n-- The White House announced that it will keep some key protections that the Obama administration extended to LBGT workers. Juliet Eilperin and Sandhya Somashekhar reported yesterday that a draft of a potential executive order was circulating in Washington over the weekend that would overturn the former president's directive barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the federal workforce and by federal contractors.\n\n-- Trump said Lockheed Martin has slashed $600 million from the cost of the F-35 fighter jet program, capping weeks of private meetings with CEO Marillyn Hewson and public criticisms of the program\u2019s cost. Aaron Gregg reports: Trump said that the cost-savings would apply to the company\u2019s next 90 planes, but offered scant details on how the program or contract would change as a result. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Lockheed, number one we\u2019re cutting the price of their planes by a lot but they\u2019re also expanding and that\u2019s going to be a good thing. Ultimately they\u2019re going to be better off,\u201d Trump told reporters. The F-35 costs about $100 million per plane, though Lockheed has said it already expects the cost of the aircraft to drop to $85 million as it increases production. It was unclear from Trump\u2019s statements how much, if any, of the cost-savings are new, or whether the savings were already in place before he intervened.\n\n-- Sean Spicer fired back at critics who he said were \u201cnitpicking\u201d Trump\u2019s recent statement on the Holocaust by highlighting the fact that he made no mention of Jews or anti-Semitism \u2013 a move that the administration insists was intentional. Abby Phillip reports: \u201cIt is pathetic that people are picking on his statement,\u201d Spicer told reporters during a White House briefing. \u201cI mean, the idea that you're nitpicking a statement that sought to remember this tragic event that occurred, and the people who died in it, is just ridiculous.\" Trump\u2019s Friday remarks on the Holocaust have prompted a wide array of criticism from a number of Jewish groups, including the Trump-allied Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\n-- Former Obama chief strategist David Axelrod criticizes Steve Bannon\u2019s appointment to the National Security Council in a CNN op-ed \u2013 saying that, contrary to what Trump officials have claimed, he and fellow adviser Robert Gibbs were not privy to the most sensitive NSC meetings. \u201cAs a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his [NSC] Principals committee over the strategy \u2026 in the war with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the president's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it. Our access also came with limits. We were barred from some of the most sensitive meetings on the Afghanistan-Pakistan policy review so as not to inhibit discussions. Beyond that, Gibbs and I did not attend regular meetings \u2026 Our expertise was in politics and communications, not national security and foreign policy and our attendance, much less participation, in these meetings would have been inappropriate.\u201d\n\n-- A team of former Trump campaign strategists have launched a nonprofit to bolster his White House agenda. The new organization, America First Policies, appears to be loosely modeled off the one started by Obama allies after his White House victory, Matea Gold reports.

That last job is so essential that a volunteer has stepped in to field calls. Melania Trump\u2019s quiet first week may signal that she is reluctantly grappling with how to embrace the increased scrutiny. Or she could simply be taking her time to determine how she will make an impact.\u201dStill, others said the First Lady\u2019s reserve could heighten interest when she does surface: \u201cSometimes less is more, and she represents that side of the equation,\u201d said Jane Hampton Cook. \u201cHer husband is more, more, more.\u201d\n\n-- Vanity Fair, \u201cCan Jared and Ivanka outrun Donald Trump\u2019s scandals?\u201d by Emily Jane Fox: \u201cThroughout the campaign, Jared Kushner wore a number of hats. A 36-year-old political novice \u2026 [Kushner has been credited with] his ability to manage the more severe messages being pushed out by the likes of Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller. But according to a source familiar with the situation, Kushner\u2019s influence on his boss may be flagging. Last week, Kushner spent 24 hours trying to broker a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The source said that Kushner was even considering flying to Mexico [to convince Pe\u00f1a Nieto] \u2026 But less than 12 hours later, it all fell apart. \u2018Kushner was [expletive] furious,\u2019 the source told me. \u201cI\u2019d never once heard him say he was angry throughout the entire campaign. But he was furious.\u2019 Kushner also appears to have already endured the physical toll of the job. He has become pale, the source noted. His body language and his demeanor toward Trump had changed, and he had lost a noticeable amount of weight from his already slight frame in just a week. Unlike the campaign, Kushner and Trump\u2019s futures are no longer entirely in their own control. Both have hitched themselves to her father\u2019s wagon and, just 10 days in, are starting to see signs that it might not work out well for their own ambitions. Trump, after all, is about Trump.\u201d\n\n-- Shane Bouvet, the 24-year-old FedEx courier who worked as Trump\u2019s volunteer social media coordinator in Illinois, and who borrowed shoes and a tux to attend his presidential inauguration, said he has received a $10,000 check from Trump in the mail. Justin Jouvenal reports: The generous gift came after Trump said read a profile about the Bouvet in The Post and requested to meet him while he was in Washington. \u201cShane \u2014 You are a great guy \u2014 thanks for all of your help,\u201d a note from Trump on presidential stationary read. Bouvet said he is planning to use the money to pay for chemotherapy for his father, who is suffering from bladder cancer.\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n-- CLICKER --> \u201cWhat life is like living with a \u2018love doll\u2019 in Japan,\u201d by Kenneth Dickerman: \u201cIn 2007, Ryan Gosling played a character who has trouble making friends or even socializing with people in a movie called \u2018Lars and the Real Girl.\u2019 Eventually, Lars learns to get past his insecurities and begins a relationship with a real woman ...

This was the actual statement.\n\nWhen will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s Twitter complaints often have the feel of coming from the @shepherd_saw_a_wolf account: Frustrated excoriations pegged to semi-accurate argumentation. But in this case, Trump is correct.\n\nThe president got out to a quick start on his nominations but only filled his final slot shortly before the inauguration. Since then, the Senate has confirmed two of his picks: James Mattis to lead the Pentagon and John Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security. Everyone else is waiting.\n\nCompare that to the last new Republican to enter the White House, George W. Bush in 2001. Bush got a late start on his Cabinet picks, since he didn\u2019t become president-elect until mid-December. But his team was filled out quickly. Even when his nominee to run the Labor Department was withdrawn \u2014 indicated by striping, below \u2014 he was able to find a replacement rapidly.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s Cabinet wasn\u2019t filled out quite as quickly.\n\nIf all of Trump\u2019s remaining picks were approved today, only one recent president would have seen a slower approval process on average: George H.W. Bush.\n\nBut all of them won\u2019t be confirmed today, of course. Here\u2019s an animated look at the recent history of confirmations.\n\nSo Trump has a point. The only problem is that the attorney general nomination is not the best example of how much the process has been delayed. In fact, if Sessions is confirmed Tuesday, it will be a relatively quick confirmation for a nominee to run the Justice Department, relative to the past 40 years.\n\nA better example would have been secretary of state. No president over that period has had to wait more than five days past inauguration for their chief diplomat to be approved.\n\nThat will have to wait for Trump\u2019s next Twitter press conference, I guess.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/11/National-Security/Images/Trump_Attorney_General_58211.jpg-e5a93.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "But Jeff Sessions isn't the best example of that to highlight.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Philip Bump"], "keywords": ["confirmed", "right", "run", "trump", "nominee", "far", "presidents", "cabinet", "slowly", "trumps", "picks", "department", "president", "general", "approved", "filled", "recent"], "tags": []}, {"title": "DeVos questionnaire appears to include passages from uncited sources", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/devos-questionnaire-appears-to-include-passages-from-uncited-sources/2017/01/31/50577dec-e7be-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html", "text": "The nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, speaks during her confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 17. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, in written responses to questions from senators, appears to have used several sentences and phrases from other sources without attribution \u2014 including from a top Obama administration civil rights official.\n\nThe responses from nominee Betsy DeVos were submitted Monday to the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is voting Tuesday morning on her confirmation.\n\nIn answering a set of questions from Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on how she would address bullying of LGBT students, DeVos wrote: \u201cEvery child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, thrive, and grow.\u201d\n\n[Here are Betsy\u2019s DeVos\u2019s answers to 139+ questions from Democratic Sen. Murray]\n\nThat sentence is almost identical to language used by Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division under President Barack Obama, in a news release announcing the administration\u2019s controversial guidance to schools on how to accommodate transgender students.\n\n(Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions)\n\n\u201cEvery child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow,\u201d Gupta said in the May 2016 release.\n\nRob Goad, a White House education adviser, said in an email: \u201cThis is character assassination. The secretary designate has long been referencing the need for safe and supportive learning environments, free of discrimination, for all students, so that they can learn, achieve, thrive, grow and lead successful productive lives. To level an accusation against her about these words included in responses to nearly 1,400 questions \u2014 139 alone from the ranking member \u2014 is simply a desperate attempt to discredit Betsy DeVos, who will serve the Department of Education and our nation\u2019s children with distinction if confirmed.\u201d\n\nThe revelation comes as Democrats are making an all-out push against key Trump nominees \u2014 including DeVos, attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin, and others. But Democrats cannot block those confirmations unless they can convince a handful of Republicans to break with the new president.\n\nDeVos has come under withering scrutiny from Democrats who have raised concerns about her advocacy for school privatization initiatives, her financial ties to the education industry and the seemingly weak grasp of federal civil rights laws she demonstrated at her confirmation hearing this month.\n\nMurray made reference to the apparent copying in remarks at the committee vote.\n\n\u201cThis nominee is being jammed through with corners being cut and with the minority being brushed aside,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just received responses to hundreds of written questions yesterday, less than 24 hours before this scheduled vote, and with no time to fully review and ask any follow-up questions. Though, I will say, upon initial review, many of the responses look copied and pasted from previous statements or are simple reiterations of the law and no true responses at all.\u201d\n\nIn a set of questions about her views on lesbian, gay and bisexual students, including about whether transgender students should be able to use bathrooms that match their gender identity, DeVos answered: \u201cEvery student deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, achieve and thrive and are not discriminated against. Period.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThat language is similar to language appearing in an article in a magazine published by ASCD, an organization devoted to education leadership.\n\nThe article outlines what educators can do to create schools that are supportive of transgender students, and concludes: \u201cYou \u2014 as an educator and an ally \u2014 can dramatically shift the school climate to one that is safe, supportive, and inclusive: a place where all students can learn, achieve, and thrive.\u201d\n\nIn other instances, answers that DeVos submitted in Murray in her 62-page response used text verbatim from federal statutes and Education Department materials without direct quotation.\n\nIn one response, to a question about whether she would continue the practice of publishing a list of schools under Title IX civil rights investigations, DeVos said, \u201cOpening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has made a determination about the merits of the complaint.\u201d\n\nThat language mirrors an Education Department website: \u201cOpening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that OCR has made a determination with regard to the merits of the complaint.\u201d\n\nOther responses refer to a requirement that the department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights \u201cmake an annual report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress summarizing the compliance and enforcement activities\u201d of the department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and that the assistant secretary is authorized \u201cto collect or coordinate the collection of data necessary to ensure compliance with civil rights laws within the jurisdiction\u201d of the civil rights office.\n\nThose are verbatim excerpts of a 1979 federal statute, but the law is not quoted or cited.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/31/National-Politics/Images/Senate_Trump_Cabinet_27221.jpg-4ef4b.jpg", "publishedDate": "", "summary": "Trump\u2019s Education Department nominee is set for a committee vote Tuesday morning.", "source": "Washington Post", "authors": ["Mike DeBonis"], "keywords": ["passages", "supportive", "responses", "nominee", "rights", "civil", "uncited", "education", "devos", "sources", "students", "questions", "questionnaire", "include", "appears", "secretary"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Yes, there are 'alternative facts.'

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nNervous laughter broke out in my classroom last week when I announced that we would be discussing alternative facts about poverty. My students knew I was alluding to Kellyanne Conway\u2019s claim that the Trump administration\u2019s estimates of the inaugural crowd size were \u201calternative facts.\u201d\n\nAlthough the claim was discredited and mocked, here\u2019s the difficulty: There are indeed such things as alternative facts. What matters in a democratic society is the ability to distinguish alternative facts from falsehoods.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nFacts (like government statistics) are socially constructed.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that reality doesn\u2019t exist; it means we use social processes to observe reality and create facts to describe it. That\u2019s plain if we look at government statistics. Consider two familiar examples, the unemployment rate and the poverty rate.\n\n[This is what Trump voters said when asked to compare his inauguration crowd with Obama\u2019s]\n\nPresident Trump has made critical comments about the unemployment rate, saying it underestimates how many people who want to work actually are out of work, and that it overstates the recovery. Although at times Trump\u2019s rhetoric was excessive, he has a point. \u201cTo be classified as unemployed, a person must be without work, be available for work, and have actively searched for work,\u201d according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn practice, that means that people who have given up looking for work don\u2019t show up in the unemployment rate. Neither do people working part time who would prefer to work full time.\n\nThere are many such limitations to the unemployment statistic, as labor economists know. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics regularly compiles and reports six measures of \u201clabor underutilization.\u201d The unemployment rate is only one of them, but it\u2019s the one most widely reported.\n\nOr consider the official poverty measure. The official poverty measure compares family income to three times the cost of food for a thrifty diet in 1963. By the census definition, family income doesn\u2019t include cash that low-income workers may receive from refundable tax credits; nor does it account for noncash government benefits such as food stamps.\n\nThe list of limitations goes on. For years, the Census Bureau has been developing an alternative measure of poverty (the Supplemental Poverty Measure) that tries to overcome these and other defects.\n\nThese alternative measures, in essence, provide alternative facts that can change how we think about the world we inhabit. For example, when the Supplemental Poverty Measure is compared to the official poverty measure, it indicates that more elderly people and fewer children are poor. Those are alternative facts.\n\nThe gap between the abstract concepts we use to discuss policy and the concrete indicators we use to construct facts implies that claims about alternative facts cannot be hastily dismissed. And if there are alternative facts, reasonable people can disagree. Presidential spokesman Sean Spicer has observed: \u201cSometimes we can disagree with the facts.\u201d\n\nSo what is the difference between reasonable people disagreeing about facts and people spreading falsehoods?\n\nConsider two examples of public discourse:\n\nPresidential spokesperson 1: \u201cRecent reports indicating the unemployment rate is down are very misleading. The unemployment rate masks the extent to which people are out of work and exaggerates how fully the economy has recovered. The real rate is closer to 40 percent.\u201d\n\nPresidential spokesperson 2: \u201cAlthough we welcome news that the unemployment rate is down, the administration is aware of the limitations of this statistic. To understand economic conditions more fully we are also monitoring alternative statistics that take a broader view of labor force participation and indicate that labor underutilization is a more significant problem than the unemployment rate suggests.\u201d\n\nIn the two examples above, spokesperson 1 should be asked to explain the claimed 40 percent rate. If he or she does not or cannot do so, that claim should not be taken seriously.\n\nSpokesperson 2 should also be asked to explain.

Here\u2019s a closer look at the three leading contenders.\n\nJudge Thomas Hardiman\n\nThomas Hardiman, one of the names on Trump\u2019s original list, is reportedly among the top contenders for the nomination. Like Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, Hardiman sits on the federal appeals court in Philadelphia. He was nominated twice by President George W. Bush for judicial posts \u2014 once to become a federal trial judge in Pittsburgh, and once for his current seat \u2014 and both times, he saw little to no opposition in the Senate.\n\nIn his decade on the federal appeals court, Hardiman has not had many occasions to weigh in on White House policies, making his views on hot-button national issues somewhat less clear.\n\nBut he has had to consider disputes over issues like policing and gun laws.

During the campaign, Trump vowed to fight gun control efforts as president and protect the Second Amendment.\n\nIf confirmed, Hardiman would be the only justice on the Supreme Court who did not attend law school at Harvard or Yale. His bachelor\u2019s degree from Notre Dame is the first college degree anyone in his family has earned, and he drove a cab to pay for his law studies at Georgetown University.\n\nPicking a Supreme Court nominee who does not have an Ivy League background would also burnish Trump\u2019s image as an outsider willing to shake up the state quo in Washington.\n\nJudge Neil Gorsuch\n\nNeil Gorsuch, who sits on the federal appeals court in Denver, also saw an easy path to confirmation for his current seat. His confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in 2006 lasted all of 20 minutes; Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the only senator in attendance.\n\nSome of Gorsuch\u2019s most notable rulings since then have come against Obama administration policies. In 2013, he signed onto a ruling blocking the Obama administration from requiring the Hobby Lobby store chain to provide contraceptive coverage as part of its employee health insurance plans.\n\nBut if Trump is looking for an anti-elite, outsider candidate, Gorsuch does not fit the bill.\n\nGorsuch is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. Before becoming a judge, Gorsuch spent a decade in Washington, where he worked for a private law firm and briefly served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nFederal appointments are in the family: Gorsuch\u2019s mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was named by President Ronald Reagan to be the first female head of the Environmental Protection Agency. She was forced to resign after 22 months in office, after being cited for contempt of Congress because of her refusal to hand over Superfund records.\n\nJudge William Pryor\n\nWilliam Pryor\u2019s path to a federal appellate court judgeship was not as smooth as Gorsuch\u2019s or Hardiman\u2019s.\n\nIn 2003, President George W.

But that wasn\u2019t until 2005 \u2014 and even then, he won confirmation on a close 53 to 45 vote. He lost the vote of at least one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a signal that he could face opposition from moderate Republicans again if he gets picked for the high court.\n\nPryor is arguably the most controversial pick among the leading candidates for the nomination.

Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, will likely move to uphold the president\u2019s policy. Sessions is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\nStill, it set up a dramatic standoff between a president and his own Justice Department just days into his tenure.\n\n\u201cI am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\u201d Yates wrote in a letter announcing her position. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\u201d\n\nMore: rare but not unprecedented for DoJ to decline to defend a law or executive order.

As protests erupted at airports over the weekend and confusion disrupted travel around the globe, some of Trump\u2019s top advisers and fellow Republicans privately noted they were not consulted about the policy.\n\nAt least three top national security officials \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order in the media.\n\nOther parts of Trump\u2019s administration were voicing dissent Monday. A large group of American diplomats circulated a memo voicing their opposition to the order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. In a startlingly combative response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer challenged those opposed to the measure to resign.\n\n\u201cThey should either get with the program or they can go,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nThe blowback underscored Trump\u2019s tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, many of whom he met for the first time during the transition, as well as with the government bureaucracy he now leads.

Photo by Kevin Lamarque/ReutersUpdated Jan. 30 at 9:30 p.m. ET| President Donald Trump fires acting Attorney General Sally Yates hours after she instructed Justice Department attorneys to not uphold theexecutive refugee and immigration ban.In a statement, the White House said Yate &#8220;betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,&#8221; adding that the executive order was approved by the department&#8217;s legal counsel.&#8220;Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,&#8221; the statement continued.The White House named attorney Dana Boente to serve as acting attorney general until Senator Jeff Sessions is fully confirmed by the Senate.Original story:WASHINGTON \u2014 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a Democratic appointee, on Monday directed Justice Department attorneys not to defend President Donald Trump&#8217;s controversial executive refugee and immigration ban, joining a growing group of administration officials distancing themselves from the new president&#8217;s order.Her directive was likely to be temporary, given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump&#8217;s pick for attorney general, will likely move to uphold the president&#8217;s policy. Sessions is awaiting Senate confirmation.Still, it set up a dramatic standoff between a president and his own Justice Department just days into his tenure.&#8220;I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution&#8217;s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,&#8221; Yates wrote in a letter announcing her position. &#8220;At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.&#8221;There should be an embedded item here. Please visit the original post to view it.Trump responded Monday by accusing Democrats of delaying approval of his Cabinet nominees for political reasons. &#8220;Now have an Obama A.G.,&#8221; the president wrote on Twitter.The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve Sessions&#8217; nomination Tuesday and he could be approved by the full Senate soon after.Yates&#8217; abrupt decision deepened the discord and dissent surrounding Trump&#8217;s order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. As protests erupted at airports over the weekend and confusion disrupted travel around the globe, some of Trump&#8217;s top advisers and fellow Republicans privately noted they were not consulted about the policy.At least three top national security officials \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials.Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order in the media.Other parts of Trump&#8217;s administration were voicing dissent Monday. A large group of American diplomats circulated a memo voicing their opposition to the order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. In a startlingly combative response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer challenged those opposed to the measure to resign.&#8220;They should either get with the program or they can go,&#8221; Spicer said.The blowback underscored Trump&#8217;s tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, many of whom he met for the first time during the transition, as well as with the government bureaucracy he now leads. While Trump outlined his plan for temporarily halting entry to the U.S. from countries with terror ties during the campaign, the confusing way in which it finally was crafted stunned some who have joined his team.Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday&#8217;s signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed.

Without the knowledge and whether those people are back there, we can\u2019t help.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even members of Congress said they were in the dark. Representative Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat, was at Dulles trying to find out if people being detained had access to lawyers, as a federal judge had ordered.

DON BEYER, D-Va.: That\u2019s exactly correct right now.

Congresswoman Barbara Comstock is a Republican who\u2019s long advocated for stricter vetting of immigrants. But she said this move was too broad and poorly executed.\n\nREP. BARBARA COMSTOCK, R-Va.: We need to go back to the drawing board on this. As I have consistently said, we shouldn\u2019t have a ban on people coming to this country based on religion.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: The executive order caused problems outside the U.S. as well. With the policy issued so swiftly, Ali Abdi didn\u2019t know what to do. Abdi is a Yale Ph.D. student originally from Iran who was studying abroad. He lives in the U.S. and has a green card. And even though officials have clarified that means he can come home, he was worried about trying.\n\nI spoke with him via Skype from Dubai this morning.\n\nALI ABDI, Green Card Holder: There has been even changes in the way the order has been interpreted over the last 48 hours. And I am very, very hopeful that the other side of the U.S., which is not bigotry and racism, changes the status quo.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: He says people like him are not the ones to be feared.\n\nALI ABDI: Let\u2019s see who are these people who are now banned from entering the country. There are students like me, graduate students who are doing their Ph.D.s, doing their master\u2019s. And they were later meant to serve the American public by teaching there, by producing knowledge there.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another Ph.D. student and green card holder tried her luck getting back home on Friday night. Nisrin Elamin is Sudanese, but she\u2019s lived in the U.S. for 20 years. She\u2019s getting her Ph.D. at Stanford, but was in Sudan doing research. Her return was a homecoming like no other.\n\nNISRIN ELAMIN, Green Card Holder: I was taken to a room and I was patted down, which was quite uncomfortable because I was touched in my chest and groin area. And then I was handcuffed very briefly, at which point I started to cry, not so much because of the handcuffs, but because, at that point, I felt like I was probably going to get deported.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: After more than five hours at JFK Airport in New York, Elamin was released and told it would be best for her not to leave the U.S. again, leaving her potentially separated from her family indefinitely.\n\nNISRIN ELAMIN: But the order, as it stands right now, my parents aren\u2019t green card holders, and they, at this point, will not be able to apply for a visa to enter the United States if they wanted to visit me.\n\nSimilarly, my sister, who lives in Australia and is a dual citizen, cannot apply for a visa. So, at present, we\u2019re in three different continents, and we can\u2019t see each other because I\u2019m also not comfortable traveling. And that makes me very sad. It also scares me a little bit.\n\nZAINAB CHAUDRY, Council on American-Islamic Relations: With just a stroke of a pen, people\u2019s lives have changed completely.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Zainab Chaudry is with the Council on American-Islamic relations. She arranged for some speakers to come to this Muslim center in Maryland to help answer people\u2019s questions. Her group, CAIR, filed a federal lawsuit today challenging the constitutionality of the president\u2019s order.\n\nZAINAB CHAUDRY: I received a phone call from a man who\u2019s not a citizen. He\u2019s a legal permanent citizen, LPR, and his mother passed away in Iran. And he was advised by his attorney to not travel to Iran to bury his mother because he wouldn\u2019t be able \u2014 chances are he wouldn\u2019t be able to return to the United States.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last night at his mosque in Washington, D.C., Imam Talib Shareef said even American citizens in his congregation are afraid.\n\nTALIB SHAREEF, Imam: They\u2019re afraid because they don\u2019t know. Obviously, there\u2019s a sense of anger right now that this is happening. They\u2019re saying, how could this have been allowed to happen? They\u2019re contributing citizens. They haven\u2019t done anything wrong. They have no intentions of doing anything wrong.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: He\u2019s worried these fears could fester into anger, and stir the pot of resentment.\n\nTALIB SHAREEF: We\u2019re now going to create enemies and we\u2019re going to divide the country further.

She served as the United States\u2019 top diplomat during the Clinton administration.\n\nWhen we spoke a short time ago, I began by asking her reaction to the Trump White House ban on immigrants from seven countries.\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT, Former U.S. Secretary of State: Judy, I\u2019m appalled, because it\u2019s done everything except keep America safer.\n\nAnd let me just say, I kind of have looked at things thinking that they made this executive action without really understanding what it\u2019s all about. So, it was unprepared, I would say, because they didn\u2019t really see how the government works. They didn\u2019t really contact the various departments that are part of this homeland security, trying to figure out what would happen once you do something like this from the Oval Office.\n\nSo, unprepared. And then I think, also, part of the problem was, they didn\u2019t understand what I say the unintended consequences of this, because the truth is that the countries that have been designated are now reacting, creating more problems for us, and then banning people \u2014 our people from going there.\n\nFor instance, in Iraq, how do we protect our troops? What about the people that are interpreting? And then I think all of it is based on untrue facts. And so I think it is a very serious problem in terms of how the whole system works.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me take a couple of those, one at a time.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying is if \u2014 they\u2019re saying, if they had let the rest of the government know what they were doing, that it would have leaked, and they said there would have been a flood of people trying to get in. And they also say that they\u2019re basically only following what the Obama administration had done a few years ago in listing countries that were the most for the United States to fear in terms of terrorism.\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, the latter is true.\n\nWhat was happened was, there was an incident where something was coming out of Iraq. They were concerned about what the facts really were. They wanted to re-vet some people. They didn\u2019t have enough manpower to do that, so things slowed down.\n\nSo there is nothing like that that happened in the Obama administration. I think the excuse about not letting others know, first of all, they need to understand that the government, in fact, when people trust each other, doesn\u2019t leak out when it\u2019s an important issue.\n\nBut how can you not let the departments that have something to do with executing the order not know? Because I think that they were genuinely surprised by, you know, how slow it was, what happened when they detained people, what happened then when there were demonstrations against it.\n\nSo I\u2019m willing to say they were surprised at the reaction to it, but that\u2019s a sign of the fact they didn\u2019t understand what they were doing.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The other argument they make, Secretary Albright, is this will all settle out, it\u2019s just the hurly-burly of the first few days, that it\u2019s only 109 people, they said, out of over 300,000 travelers over the weekend, and that we\u2019re all making too much of this.\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT: No, we\u2019re not, because what it\u2019s shown is that the United States is not prepared to deal with something that the president has decided he wants to do, so it puts real question as to how the system works.\n\nIt also has undermined other countries\u2019 trust in what we do, trying to figure out who in the department is responsible for what. And then I actually think it\u2019s a gift to those that hate us, because now what has happened is ISIS is really kind of saying, yes, right, this is what America is like, you can\u2019t trust us.\n\nAnd so I think they basically were completely unprepared for what they kind of unwrapped, without really considering the unintended consequences, and I don\u2019t think it makes us any safer.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: One of the other moves the Trump administration made over the weekend was to announce a reorganization of the National Security Council, which, in effect, appears to downgrade the role of the director of national intelligence, and also the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThey had also downgraded the role of the CIA director, but they now in the last \u2014 today have restored that. How do you read that move on the part of President Trump?\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I teach about decision-making, so I have been thinking about this.\n\nAnd I think it also wasn\u2019t thought out, and partially because \u2014 we have heard a lot of stories about how the transition really wasn\u2019t done very well. I have been transitioned into and I have done the transitioning. It\u2019s a fascinating process of turning over the crown jewels when it\u2019s done properly. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAnd so I think they didn\u2019t understand how the system works, and, in fact, downgrading the role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Maybe they think they already have too many generals, but the bottom line is that it\u2019s important for that person to be in the meetings no matter what.\n\nAnd what they have done is say only when it\u2019s really necessary, decided by the national security adviser, and the same for the director of national intelligence. It\u2019s important to know the intelligence and the response of the military.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The other change they made was to add Steve Bannon, who is a senior adviser to the president, to the \u2014 the campaign adviser \u2014 add him to the National Security Council attendees, principals \u2014 I guess you call it principals list.\n\nTheir argument is, well, the Obama administration had people like David Axelrod and others who sat in on national security meeting.\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT: That \u2014 you know, frankly, that is the most outrageous thing that they have done, is to add somebody with an extreme ideology to those that are supposed to be making decisions based on U.S. national interests, not on ideology.\n\nAnd it\u2019s one thing to have one of the advisers come in on occasion when the issue is some combination of domestic and foreign policy, but not to have somebody with the views of Bannon that we now hear to be there all the time.\n\nAnd the troublesome part about all this is, what is the circle around the president? Who does he listen to? And the examples that we have had, whether it\u2019s now with the immigration executive action or just generally, is the decision-making process.\n\nWe\u2019re not a new country. We have had a decision-making process. And they have, in fact, developed something different. And, Judy, I thought the following. Disruption is not a bad thing for bureaucracy. Destruction, however, is very dangerous.\n\nAnd so what we have seen in the last week, I think, is dangerous.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, last question. Impression of Rex Tillerson, who is the president\u2019s designee to be the next secretary of state?\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I have met him. I think he\u2019s a very fine person. He\u2019s been a very good CEO of Exxon.\n\nThe question is how he\u2019s going to operate within this particular setup, how he\u2019s going to work with the State Department, where a top group of people have left who are some of the operational people, and then how is he going to define what the roles of the State Department is?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state, thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Great to be with you.

We have had a decision-making process. And they have, in fact, developed something different. And, Judy, I thought the following. Disruption is not a bad thing for bureaucracy. Destruction, however, is very dangerous.And so what we have seen in the last week, I think, is dangerous.JUDY WOODRUFF:Very quickly, last question. Impression of Rex Tillerson, who is the president&#8217;s designee to be the next secretary of state?MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:Well, I have met him. I think he&#8217;s a very fine person. He&#8217;s been a very good CEO of Exxon.The question is how he&#8217;s going to operate within this particular setup, how he&#8217;s going to work with the State Department, where a top group of people have left who are some of the operational people, and then how is he going to define what the roles of the State Department is?JUDY WOODRUFF:Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state, thank you very much for talking with us.MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:Great to be with you.

They include places where ISIS controls foreign territory. And they are places where people are coming in to receive terrorist training and then being pushed out to carry out acts of terrorism across Europe, perhaps in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nAnd so, absolutely, it makes sense to put a temporary bar on people holding those passports from coming into the United States. Also another really important part of this executive order was the reviewing our refugee program, also putting that on hold, because we have huge problems with terrorists abusing our refugee program.\n\nI might just give you a quick statistic there. Since the 1990s, there have been 18 major terrorists who have either committed acts of terror or names you would recognize who got into our refugee program. The blind sheik, Omar Abdel-Rahman, came in through the refugee program. The two Boston Marathon bombers originally came into the United States through the refugee program.\n\nThe Bowling Green, Kentucky, terrorists, refugee program. So, it makes sense to say, hey, we\u2019re a very generous nation. We give out more asylum. We allow in more refugees than any other country on the planet, but we are going to reassess how we screen people because way too many terrorists are fraudulently coming into the United States as refugees.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: The one problem with all that argument is that, of the seven countries singled out, no refugees from those particular countries are implicated in any attacks. Were the wrong countries picked?\n\nKRIS KOBACH: No, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nThe Bowling Green, Kentucky, I believe those were from Iraq. The geographical locus \u2014 focus of where the terrorists are active changes with time, right? So, al-Qaida wasn\u2019t necessarily active in the exact same countries now.\n\nSomalia has become much more active as a place where terrorist training and terrorist activity occurs. So it only makes sense that the seven countries or 10 countries or however many we\u2019re most interested in might change over time as the facts on the ground change.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: A practical question here. You mentioned Somalia.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to do extreme vetting of someone who comes from Somalia, how on earth do you do that? Somalia doesn\u2019t even really have a functioning government. What does extreme vetting look like when a person comes out of a country like that?\n\nKRIS KOBACH: That\u2019s a great question, because what happens when someone comes in, let\u2019s take, for example, someone coming in as a refugee.\n\nSo, they say that they have a credible fear of persecution \u2014 that\u2019s the legal standard \u2014 in their home country. Well, if the home country doesn\u2019t even have a functioning government, you don\u2019t have any police departments, you don\u2019t have any centralized database of records, you may not have any way of verifying anything that this person is saying.\n\nAnd, right now, in the refugee program for the past, you know, 10 years or so, there has been a sort of get-to-yes mentality, take the refugee\u2019s, the intending refugee\u2019s word for it.\n\nI think we have to be much stricter. And we have to say, look, we need some proof, we need some evidence that your story is true, because there are so many cases that we learn about after the fact where the refugee\u2019s story was completely untrue.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Seems like that would be very difficult to come up with any kind of documentation in that situation.\n\nKRIS KOBACH: It would. It may be.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Let\u2019s talk about politics for just a \u2014 yes.\n\nSome Republicans on the Hill are even expressing concerns about this, Senator McCain among them, saying that it basically fits in \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing \u2014 fits into the ISIS narrative, in essence, that their \u2014 the propaganda that they spew out is that America is anti-Muslim, and this fits into that narrative well.\n\nIf the real concern, the real threat is homegrown terrorism, incited by the Internet, by Twitter, by Facebook, if that\u2019s the real threat, haven\u2019t we made ourselves less safer by adding to this ISIS narrative?\n\nKRIS KOBACH: I don\u2019t think so at all.\n\nI mean, we as a nation can walk and chew gum at the same time. You\u2019re absolutely right. Homegrown terrorism is a threat, but so is imported terrorism where the terrorists are trained overseas and they are sent to the United States to kill Americans.\n\nSo we have to do both. And there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t do both. But this is the best way to put enhanced screening on people seeking entry to the United States, the best way to protect the American public.\n\nAnd, remember, that\u2019s the first and highest purpose of the United States government is to protect American citizens. We are not facing an invasion from a conventional army anytime soon, but we are facing individual acts of terrorism. And many of those individuals come in across our border through a port of entry.\n\nAnd we owe it to the American people. The U.S. government owes it to the American people to be very cautious in allowing someone in from these regions of the world where we know ISIS is active and there is active terrorist activity and training going on.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Is it possible, though, we have given ISIS a case in point for their argument that the U.S. is anti-Muslim?\n\nKRIS KOBACH: I don\u2019t think so.\n\nYou know, I hear the argument made that this executive order is anti-Muslim, and it seems to me that that\u2019s clearly false. I mean, the \u2014 it\u2019s based on the country of origin. So, if you\u2019re an atheist, if you\u2019re a Christian, if you\u2019re a Jew coming from one of these countries, you will be subject to the same bar on entry as a Muslim coming from these countries.\n\nFurthermore, you have got about 40 additional countries in the world that are majority Muslim and they are not affected by this executive order. So, clearly, on its face, it is not anti-Muslim. It is a geographic-based action to secure America from people coming from dangerous places in the world.\n\nIt is a geographic ban. It\u2019s not in any way a religious ban.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: OK, but there is a religious component to this. Christians, of course, are specifically singled out for priority.\n\nLet me ask you this. You teach or have taught constitutional law. How does this square with the Constitution? You know, I\u2019m your student for a moment. Teach me about the Constitution and how this jibes with what the founding fathers were thinking.\n\nKRIS KOBACH: OK.\n\nWell, first of all, the \u2014 no one who is outside of the United States and is not a United States citizen has a constitutional right to enter the United States. I have heard some people who are critics of the president\u2019s executive order argue that it\u2019s unconstitutional. That\u2019s absolutely incorrect.\n\nThere is no constitutional right to enter the United States. Even if you have already been in the United States in the past, you have no constitutional right to come back in.\n\nSecond thing is, the Congress has the authority to \u2014 it has what\u2019s called plenary authority to pass laws relating to immigration. It has the first and highest authority to pass those laws.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a statute, Title 8, Section 1182F, which gives the president a discretion that if he feels that the entry of any alien or class of aliens would be detrimental to the national interests of the United States, he can exclude those individuals.\n\nAnd there are similar statutes going all the way back to the beginning in 1789 with the Alien Acts. George Washington, after they were passed, had authority to exclude or remove anyone who was a national security threat way back then.\n\nSo, legally speaking, the president is on absolutely secure ground. People may quibble about the politics of it all, but I think, in terms of the national security of the United States, these executive orders are a win. And I think that you will find that, in the end, the vast majority of Americans will be supportive.\n\nMILES O\u2019BRIEN: Kansas Secretary of State and former Trump adviser Kris Kobach, thank you very much.\n\nKRIS KOBACH: My pleasure.", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kobach1-e1485825332129.jpg", "publishedDate": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 23:35:38 +0000", "summary": "Watch Video|Listen to the AudioMILES O&#8217;BRIEN:And for a different point of view, I spoke a short while ago to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who was a top adviser to Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and transition process.I began by asking him whether the U.S. is safer now as a result of the White House ban.KRIS KOBACH,Secretary of State, Kansas: These seven countries are the hotbeds of terrorism.

He said he was going to move on immigration.\n\nAMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Right.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The public reaction is interesting. A Pew poll out earlier this month showed, what, by 48 to 42 percent, people supported this.\n\nAMY WALTER: Yes, this is actually \u2014 this is a Quinnipiac poll that came out earlier this month.\n\nAnd they said very specifically support or oppose suspending immigration from terror-prone areas, right, sounds very familiar, even if it means turning away refugees. So, they put that in there as well \u2014 48 percent approved.\n\nBut, as you know, Judy, the world that we live in right now, not surprisingly, 72 percent of Republicans supported it. Only 24 percent of Democrats said they supported it, and independents closely divided. And such we have the world that we\u2019re going to inhabit, it looks like, for the foreseeable future.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, what we\u2019re watching is a very divided political reaction, Democrats almost universally saying this is a terrible idea, Republicans divided.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, National Public Radio: Yes, Democrats rallying at the Supreme Court tonight, introducing legislation that will go nowhere or not even be able to be brought up on the floor, but Democratic lawmakers are protesting.\n\nOn the Republican side, there are sort of a range of reactions. There are people who strongly support what President Trump has signed and what he is doing. There are others who are expressing concerns, and that sort of falls into two categories.\n\nThere are people who express a moral concern or a concern that action like this could actually make us less safe, rather than more safe, could give a propaganda advantage to organizations like ISIS. That\u2019s John McCain, Lindsey Graham. Not very many Republican senators going that far.\n\nMost of them are talking more about like logistical challenges, about the rollout could have been a better. Well, the rollout could have been a lot better.\n\nBut one senator said, this extreme vetting proposal needed more extreme vetting itself.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, is there \u2014 we\u2019re so early into this next term.\n\nAMY WALTER: That\u2019s right.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a political calculation for these Republicans?\n\nAMY WALTER: Right. I think a lot of them are still waiting to find out how people are reacting to it.\n\nSo, we pointed to the poll, which was theoretical. What do you think about the theory behind this? \u2014 48 percent support. Now that we have seen it, the rollout clearly varying, not very good, once we see the sort of human cost of it, is this going to change people\u2019s minds, or are they going to get just even more hunkered down in this?\n\nAnd, as we all know, politicians like to wait and watch for where the folks are going. I think it\u2019s really important, to Tam\u2019s point, that even those Democrats who sit in red states, really red states, have come out unambiguously against Donald Trump. And even Republicans who sit in sort of squishy, tentatively Republican districts, most of them have held back and not said much.\n\nSome have come out, but mostly they have held back. I think you are going to see those battle lines. As we saw in that poll, if you\u2019re a Democrat, you are going to support Trump \u2014 you\u2019re going to oppose him. If you\u2019re a Republican, you are going to support him.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And yet, Tam, we see, looking at a news organization, or at least an editorial page that normally is very friendly to Donald Trump, The Wall Street Journal, writing today, very critical, saying the way \u2014 critical of the way it was done, saying he needlessly alienated people, but then goes on to say, \u201cThe danger is, he will alienate the friends and allies at home and abroad he needs to succeed.\u201d\n\nSo, The Journal taking a longer look at this.\n\nTAMARA KEITH: Right.\n\nAnd that gets to some of the national security concerns, that national security experts and veterans of national security argue that this could actually put us in more danger, that there are \u2014 the best allies that America has in fighting organizations like ISIS are Muslims themselves.\n\nAnd I think that that\u2019s getting at that, but it also gets at a little \u2014 it\u2019s almost like a more liberal editorial board saying to the Obama administration, oh, my gosh, you really could have done the rollout of Obamacare better several years ago.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.\n\nWell, it reminds us, Amy, these issues are complicated.\n\nAMY WALTER: They are.\n\nAnd I think I will go back to the point that you brought up earlier, which is, elections have consequences. Donald Trump the candidate said he was going to do this. A lot of people voted. Millions and millions of people voted for Donald Trump the candidate. He\u2019s now the president, and he\u2019s going through and he\u2019s doing this.\n\nAnd so the sort of outrage that we\u2019re seeing around the country, while it\u2019s not surprising, it\u2019s also has to \u2014 you have to remember that this is something that he promised that he was going to do on the campaign trail and that he\u2019s putting out in reality.\n\nWhat we need to do \u2014 and we talked about this last week \u2014 is to wait and watch for the longer-term implications.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nAMY WALTER: Is it going to have an impact on our national security? We don\u2019t know. There may be something linked to that. Is it going to have something to do with our diplomacy? Is it going to have a detrimental impact on our diplomacy? Maybe. We don\u2019t know yet.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that this is something he said he was going to do, and he\u2019s implementing it.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly to both of you, another thing we saw is the influence of Steve Bannon, senior adviser to the president. We saw the president in the last few days say that he wants to add Steve Bannon, Tam, to the National Security Council principals, the people who sit in on these very important private sessions on what the country does.\n\nSteve Bannon is turning out to be a major player there.\n\nTAMARA KEITH: And when the senior stuff was announced, he was announced at the same time as the chief of staff as sort of a co-equal.\n\nAnd it\u2019s very clear \u2014 it was clear in the inaugural address. It\u2019s been clear in many of these memoranda and orders that his voice is there, his words are there.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And people watching because of this alt-right narrative around Breitbart.\n\nAMY WALTER: Right, and that he is going to be a very influential voice. But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s name on all the legislation and all the executive orders, and the buck stops with him.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, Politics Monday, thank you both.\n\nTAMARA KEITH: You\u2019re welcome.\n\nAMY WALTER: You\u2019re welcome.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.\n\nAnd a postscript.

But several critics have claimed the short-term number could be higher.\n\nOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union estimated that between 100 and 200 people were immediately impacted by the order. The New York Times reported that 173 people overseas were blocked from boarding planes to the U.S. And over the weekend, thousands of people protested the orders at airports in New York, Washington, D.C., Detroit and elsewhere around the country as people arriving in the U.S. were detained, making the final number of people unclear.\n\nAdding to the confusion, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Sunday that \u201cgoing forward\u201d the executive order wouldn\u2019t block U.S. green card-holders from reentering the country. The comment seemed to contradict part of the original executive order, and opened the door to more questions about how the new policy will be implemented. According to CNN, at least 170 people with green cards were admitted into the U.S. through Sunday afternoon.\n\nRegardless of the number of people affected in the order\u2019s immediate aftermath, it has long-term implications. One news report suggested up to 134 million people worldwide could be impacted by the new travel restrictions.\n\nThe claim: Court stays issued over the weekend will block Trump\u2019s order\n\nThe rundown: The federal court rulings did not block the entire order\n\nA federal judge in Brooklyn issued a stay Sunday temporarily blocking parts of President Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees. The ruling came after the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqi citizens, who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York upon arriving in the U.S.\n\nA federal judge in Virginia issued a similar ruling over the weekend blocking travelers who had been detained at Dulles International Airport, outside of Washington, D.C. from being deported. That ruling also ordered that the detained travelers be given access to an attorney.\n\nThe decisions were a victory for opponents of the policy. But they\u2019re just the first step in what could be a lengthy legal battle. They also didn\u2019t block Trump\u2019s entire executive order: The rulings only blocked federal officials from deporting green card-holders who were detained after the order went into effect. The court decisions didn\u2019t weigh in on the constitutionality of President Trump\u2019s policy, meaning that some provisions in the executive orders could still be upheld in court.\n\nThe claim: Trump\u2019s order is similar to President Obama\u2019s 2011 review of Iraqi visas\n\nThe rundown: There are a number of key differences\n\nIn defending his executive order, President Trump compared the ban to actions taken by President Obama during his first term in office.\n\n\u201cMy policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nBut a review of the record shows that\u2019s a big stretch.\n\nIn 2011, the Obama administration announced plans to review the status of around 58,000 Iraqi refugees living in the United States. The review was launched after two Iraqi men were arrested on federal terrorism charges in Kentucky that year. (They had tried to ship weapons and money from the U.S. to insurgents in Iraq, and also admitted to building bombs used against American soldiers in Iraq. The men plead guilty and were sentenced to federal prison in 2013).\n\nObama\u2019s order reviewed the immigration status of the 58,000 Iraqi refugees, and set up a stricter vetting process for Iraqis seeking special visas to enter the U.S. The extra security clearance caused delays in processing visas. The program was eventually rolled back in 2014, then reinstated the following year.\n\nBut the program was not a blanket ban on all refugees from Iraq, which is what President Trump imposed with his executive order last week. Obama issued a statement Monday saying his actions never halted Iraqi visas, but instead created a tougher temporary vetting system. The Trump administration\u2019s actions are significantly broader.\n\nThe claim: Trump\u2019s order builds on Obama\u2019s 2015 refugee policy\n\nThe rundown: The new order is significantly broader\n\nPresident Trump and administration officials also compared his executive order on refugees to a visa waiver program put in place by the Obama administration in 2015. But that comparison isn\u2019t totally accurate, either.\n\nIn late 2015, Obama signed a year-end spending bill that included a change to an existing visa waiver program. The measure, called the \u201cVisa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015,\u201d placed restrictions on natives of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria applying for U.S. visas. The restrictions also applied to anyone who had traveled to those countries since 2011.\n\nEarly last year, the Department of Homeland Security expanded the list of restricted countries to include Yemen, Somalia and Libya. In recent days, Trump administration officials have pointed to these two policies, claiming the Obama administration came up with the list of countries to which the new executive order applies.\n\nThe Obama administration did create the list, but the visa waiver program vetted applicants on a \u201ccase-by-case basis,\u201d as the Department of Homeland Security noted last February. The program still allowed people from the listed countries to apply for visas, and gave exemptions to certain individuals, such as humanitarian aid workers and journalists. \u201cThe new law does not ban travel to the United States, or admission into the United States,\u201d DHS said in its statement last February.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order, on the other hand, puts a 90-day freeze, without exemptions, on refugees and visa holders traveling to the U.S. from the seven listed countries. And it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering the country as well.\n\nThe claim: The order makes the U.S. safer\n\nThe rundown: A lot of lawmakers \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 don\u2019t think so\n\nPresident Trump said Sunday that the order would make the country safer, while dismissing criticism that it amounted to a de facto ban on Muslims entering the country. \u201cThis is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keep our country safe,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\n\nSome Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, backed the refugee order. But many GOP officials said they believed the policy would not make the country safer, breaking from the president on one of his signature campaign issues.\n\nSens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) issued a joint statement saying the order could \u201cbecome a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d They added: \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d\n\nFormer Republican officials criticized the order as well. Mitch Daniels, a former governor of Indiana and official in the George W. Bush administration, said he hoped Trump would \u201crethink\u201d the policy.\n\n\u201cIf the idea is to strengthen the protection of Americans against terrorism, there are many far better ways to achieve it,\u201d Daniels, the president of Purdue University, said in a statement.", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RTSXU2T-e1485813926808.jpg", "publishedDate": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 22:24:21 +0000", "summary": "Protesters in Queens, New York hold signs in support of immigrants and refugees.

But many GOP officials said they believed the policy would not make the country safer, breaking from the president on one of his signature campaign issues.Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) issued ajoint statementsaying the order could \u201cbecome a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d They added: \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201dFormer Republican officials criticized the order as well. Mitch Daniels, a former governor of Indiana and official in the George W. Bush administration, said he hoped Trump would \u201crethink\u201d the policy.\u201cIf the idea is to strengthen the protection of Americans against terrorism, there are many far better ways to achieve it,\u201d Daniels, the president of Purdue University, said in a statement.The postFact checking Trump&#8217;s new immigration orderappeared first onPBS NewsHour.", "source": "PBS", "authors": ["Daniel Bush"], "keywords": ["trump", "checking", "country", "executive", "administration", "immigration", "program", "trumps", "president", "refugees", "order", "fact", "obama"], "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Editors' Picks", "refugee order"]}, {"title": "Confusion, questions and handcuffs met this Sudanese scholar at the airport", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/confusion-questions-handcuffs-met-sudanese-scholar-airport/", "text": "Student Nisrin Elamin of Sudan describes what was different this time when she arrived at JFK airport in New York late Friday night.\n\nSudanese-born Nisrin Elamin, a Ph.D. student studying anthropology at Stanford University, is used to intensive questioning when she reenters the U.S. with her green card.\n\nBut on Friday night, it was different.

Some news reports had indicated Kelly found out about the order while mid-flight on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe did know the executive order was coming \u2026 we knew it was coming, it wasn\u2019t a surprise, it was coming and then we implemented it,\u201d Kelly said, noting that he \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t learn about it on an airplane.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order and the immediate implementation of it caused confusion at airports, particularly when it came to travelers affected by the order who were already in the air when it was signed. Some travelers from the seven affected countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- were detained for hours upon arrival at U.S. airports until a judge granted a stay on their deportations Saturday night.\n\nBut Kelly said there was no such chaos at U.S. Customs, suggesting that the \u201cchaos\u201d at airports was from protests outside of immigration checkpoints.\n\n\u201cOur officers who are at the counter so to speak, the only chaos they saw was what was taking place in other parts of the airport,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey knew what they were doing as immigrants or not immigrants but foreign nationals presented themselves.\u201d\n\nKelly also defended the order as necessary for national security, saying it is a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be characterized as a \u201ctravel ban\u201d or a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not, I repeat, not a ban on Muslims,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe Homeland Security mission is to safeguard the American people, our homeland, our values -- and religious liberty is one of our most fundamental and treasured values. It is important to understand that there are terrorists and other bad actors that are seeking to infiltrate our homeland every single day.\u201d\n\nHe said the various executive orders Mr. Trump have signed are a \u201cmatter of national security,\u201d and said he has directed DHS to implement the immigration-related order \u201cprofessionally, humanely and in accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nTop-level DHS officials, including the acting heads of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), explained the process that has unfolded as officials sorted out who the order applied to and how to most efficiently implement it.\n\nKevin McAleena, the acting head of CBP, said more than one million travelers traveled into the U.S. by air in the first three days the order was in place, 500,000 of which were foreign nationals.\n\nOf those, McAleena said the U.S. denied boarding to 721 travelers, processed waivers for 1,060 lawful permanent residents and 75 visa-holders. He also said 872 refugees will be arriving this week after waivers are processed for them.\n\nStill, he said it\u2019s \u201cfair to acknowledge\u201d that communications about the order \u201chaven\u2019t been the best in the initial rollout of this process.\u201d", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/31/6a504999-37c0-4f8f-b2d0-296cfb02e68c/thumbnail/1200x630/848a112b42e7183e416404d346b50554/2017-01-10t214440z-695572600-rc140e94d010-rtrmadp-3-usa-congress-kelly.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:33:16 -0500", "summary": "\"We knew it was coming,\" Kelly told reporters Tuesday after accusations that the abrupt rollout had caught federal agencies off guard", "source": "CBS News", "authors": ["Emily Schultheis"], "keywords": ["trump", "implementation", "travelers", "travel", "knew", "signed", "defends", "ban", "chief", "officials", "homeland", "coming", "kelly", "security", "john", "dhs", "order"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Elaine Chao confirmed as Treasury secretary by Senate", "url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elaine-chao-confirmed-as-treasury-secretary-by-senate/", "text": "The Senate has confirmed Elaine Chao to serve as Transportation secretary in the Trump administration.\n\nThe vote was 93-6 on Tuesday.

We\u2019re not here to take care of people,\u201d said Jim Buterbaugh, the head of custodial work and maintenance at a public school in the western Montana town of White Hall. \u201cI understand that people need help, but there are other ways besides bringing them here.\u201d\n\nButerbaugh, who has actively fought the re-settlement of Syrians in Montana, was frustrated that Trump\u2019s moratorium did not include countries such as Saudi Arabia, where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from. The executive order also did not include the creation of safe zones for refugees, which he favors.\n\nMike Honaker has some misgivings, too. A Trump supporter in a struggling West Virginia coal town, he didn\u2019t think \u201cblitzing everybody\u201d with an order that spread chaos around the world was the right way to go.\n\nBut Honaker worries about terrorism and does not have a problem with Trump\u2019s plan to screen refugees more thoroughly. Overall, Honaker likes 85 percent of what the president has done so far.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s shaking it up, the whole of Washington, D.C., and half the country, like he said he would,\u201d he said.\n\nAttorney Terri King, 56, said Trump\u2019s order has widespread support in her Rust Belt city of Middletown, Ohio.\n\nThe only people who don\u2019t support it are \u201cthose who are paid to protest on the left ... and some Democrats,\u201d said King, an also-ran in a GOP congressional race last year.\n\nVenitta Ferguson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, said national security was a priority for her during the election, and Trump has delivered on what he promised.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what he\u2019s done,\u201d the 59-year-old Ferguson said. \u201cWe\u2019re in that kind of world where to ignore the possibility that even one person out of 10,000 has ill intentions is foolish.\u201d\n\nCharles Lewis, a retired firefighter in Topeka, Kansas, said he voted for Trump in part because of national security issues, and he supports the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe need to know who these people are,\u201d said Lewis, 64. \u201cI just don\u2019t think this nation is secure. We\u2019re a day late and a dollar short on everything.\u201d", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/15/b15f21b8-7841-4d56-8b8e-85cd4a4195fc/thumbnail/1200x630/c3a0ff49ec2442b12dc8976335522411/ap-16113028142993.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:49:58 -0500", "summary": "Red state residents applaud controversial executive order that sparked protests in big cities", "source": "CBS News", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "keywords": ["seven", "think", "trump", "hes", "immigration", "nation", "fans", "trumps", "need", "president", "security", "order", "refugees", "playing"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Congressional leaders blindsided, scrambling on refugee ban", "url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/congressional-leaders-blindsided-scrambling-on-refugee-ban/", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When President Donald Trump paused the nation\u2019s refugee program with the stroke of a pen, top congressional leaders of his own party were left to find out the same way the general public did: from the media as Trump signed the order.\n\n\u201cI guess one of you guys probably told me about it. Thank you for that,\u201d GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Monday.\n\nThen, as lawmakers struggled to gather details for constituents about the temporary halt to all refugee admissions, as well as immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, at least one prominent GOP senator was told that the State Department had been instructed not to communicate with Congress.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of answers as of today. In fact my staff was told the State Department as of today was ordered not to talk to Congress about this issue,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \u201cThat cannot be a permanent position, we expect answers here fairly soon.\u201d\n\nNext followed the surprising news, first reported by Politico, that the administration\u2019s repeated claims that Hill Republicans were involved in drafting the executive order apparently referred to staffers on the House Judiciary Committee who acted without the knowledge of GOP leadership.\n\nEach new revelation set off alarm bells on Capitol Hill where Republicans, eager to give Trump the benefit of the doubt barely a week into his presidency, are confronting repeated bouts of chaos of the administration\u2019s own making. The failure to consult with lawmakers ahead of time on the immigration executive order set the stage for high-profile Republicans to criticize the measure once it started attracting widespread controversy \u2014 and so they did, though House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have remained largely supportive.\n\nAnd the administration\u2019s decision to make a major foreign policy move with no notice to Congress raised questions about how well the Trump White House will work with Capitol Hill to push through a massive legislative agenda that includes repealing and replacing Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, overhauling the tax code and building a border wall. Although many Republicans remained optimistic that the failures amounted to growing pains for the new administration, congressional relations under the Trump administration seemed to be off to a sour start.\n\n\u201cI think they understand, let me put it that way, that this was not handled in the most productive manner,\u201d Corker said. \u201cMy guess is next time they attempt to do something that is far-reaching like this there\u2019ll be a lot more communication.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order pauses America\u2019s entire refugee program and indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria. Federal judges in New York and several other states issued orders that temporarily block the government from deporting people with valid visas who arrived after Trump\u2019s travel ban took effect. Trump fired the Justice Department\u2019s acting attorney general Monday after she refused to defend the order in court, replacing her with someone who would.\n\nThroughout the day Monday, as confusion continued at home and abroad over the scope and implementation of the order, White House officials led by press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that Hill Republicans were involved in drafting the order and were aware of it beforehand. Yet top aides to House GOP leaders repeatedly disputed that assertion, leaving it unclear what Spicer was talking about.\n\nFinally late Monday, confirming some details of a report in Politico, the House Judiciary Committee said that some staff members had been \u201cpermitted\u201d to lend their expertise on immigration to the Trump transition team. Yet leadership was not aware, and earlier in the day committee officials had said that the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, was not consulted on drafting the executive order, so the staff effort appeared to take place behind the backs of top House Republicans, an unusual circumstance.\n\nTop GOP senators including Rubio, Corker and John McCain of Arizona all said the order was overly broad or poorly implemented and needed to be revisited, something that the administration is confronting anyway because of court challenges. Several lawmakers said they were hopeful the administration would come up with a better alternative, and that next time a major decision is made, the Hill will be involved early on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to pick a fight,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. \u201cIt\u2019s a new administration, everybody\u2019s learning their way.\u201d", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/03/15/a675eaf2-2629-4d2d-ae2e-44a0643e7cdb/thumbnail/1200x630/2130922a2127befe0a91789251f697d3/2016-03-15t045737z762984750gf10000345666rtrmadp3usa-election-rubio.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:26:20 -0500", "summary": "Republican, Democratic lawmakers say they were given little warning about immigration shake-up", "source": "CBS News", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "keywords": ["scrambling", "leaders", "house", "refugee", "republicans", "administration", "gop", "way", "hill", "committee", "ban", "blindsided", "told", "order", "congressional", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump administration says it will keep LGBTQ protections", "url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-says-it-will-keep-lgbtq-protections/", "text": "The White House says the new administration has no interest in rolling back protections of LGBTQ workers.\n\n\u201cPresident Donald J.

With degrees from Harvard and Oxford and establishment credentials, Gorsuch has a judicial philosophy modeled after Antonin Scalia, the justice he would replace.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople talk about members of their professions as lions of the profession, and I often have a difficult time understanding the analogy.

In his book, \u201cThe Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\u201d he argues for the sanctity of life.\n\n\n\nAlso on Mr. Trump\u2019s shortlist is Hardiman, whose nomination in the fall of 2006 to the federal appeals court was so uncontroversial just one senator attended the hearing. Hardiman is considered a law-and-order judge and favors gun rights.\n\n\n\nIf Gorsuch is blue blood, Hardiman is blue collar. He\u2019s the first member of his family to graduate from college \u2013 Notre Dame, with honors \u2013 and he put himself through Georgetown Law driving a taxi. He would be the only justice from outside the Ivy League, as he discussed at a law school forum with Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we should have people from other law schools. It\u2019s all Harvard and Yale,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters Monday that he\u2019d made up his mind. But whoever he chooses better brace for a fight.

Of those, 392 were admitted (two were denied: one Canadian dual citizen walked back across the Canadian border, and the other was arrested on an outstanding criminal charge).\n\nBy Sunday night, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it was no longer holding any individuals at U.S. airports over green card issues.\n\nOn Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus revised the administration\u2019s treatment of green card holders, and told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the executive order did not place \u201cfurther burdens on people that hold green cards.\u201d But he added that CBP agents have wide discretion in questioning travelers from these countries, and those traveling back and forth from one of those countries will get \u201ca few more questions.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, President Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she ordered Justice Dept. lawyers to stop defending Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning new arrivals to the U.S. from the seven Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Trump named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as acting attorney general until Sen. Jeff Sessions is confirmed as attorney general by the Senate. His nomination is to be voted on in committee Tuesday before consideration by the full Senate. Although Senate Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to block the nomination, they can use procedural maneuvers to draw the process out.\n\nRefugees\n\nThe order also bars all refugees from entering the U.S. for four months, and indefinitely halts any refugees from Syria. The president said the ban was needed to keep out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s order immediately suspended for four months a program that last year resettled in the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. An immediate 90-day ban was put in place for all immigration to the U.S. from the seven Muslim majority nations.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, ordering that anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war, are indefinitely blocked from coming to the U.S. The president explained as he signed the order, \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.\u201d\n\nHis ban on asylum-seekers came down even as Iraqis endangered by work for the United States in their home country were midflight to their hoped-for refuge in the United States. As a result, they and countless other refugees, their families and aid workers scrambled Saturday as Muslim travelers were turned back on arrival at U.S. airports or blocked from boarding flights to America.\n\nThe president said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give agencies time to develop a stricter screening system. He directed Homeland Security and State Department officials to review the refugee application and approval process and find any more measures that could prevent those who pose a threat from using the refugee program.\n\nSome exceptions may be made -- the U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \u201cprovided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country.\u201d The order does not specify which religions the president had in mind, but in an interview with CBN News, he said \u201cwe are going to help\u201d Syrian Christians, whom he said had suffered more persecution than Muslims.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order.\n\nDuring the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order would cut refugee limit to 50,000.\n\nBorder security and immigration enforcement\n\nThe wall\n\nPerhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s signature issue during the presidential campaign was his promise to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d across the southern border.\n\nThe White House says that the order he signed Wednesday marks the beginning of the fulfillment of that pledge. The order calls for the homeland security secretary to \u201ctake all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border.\u201d\n\nHowever, the order does not indicate how construction of the wall will be funded, although it does call on the homeland security secretary to find funds for the wall\u2019s construction, and prepare budget requests for Congress. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay for the wall, although he\u2019s been vague on how that would happen. In recent days, the White House has said that the wall might be financed by a tariff imposed on Mexican-produced goods.\n\nIn any event, Mexico\u2019s president has repeatedly said his nation willnot pay for the wall. But Mr. Trump may have some leverage over his Mexican counterpart in that the United States sends that nation millions of dollars in aid, although Mr. Trump has said the wall would cost at least $8 billion, and perhaps as much as $12 billion.\n\nOther estimates put the figure much higher. Regardless, the executive order instructs the heads of government agencies to determine how much the U.S. hands over to Mexico each year, indicating that some of that funding could go towards the wall.\n\nThe executive order also calls for 5,000 new border patrol officers. Mr. Trump often touted his support from border patrol officers while on the campaign trail, saying they supported his plan to lock down the southern border.\n\nThe authority rests with Congress to allocate the funds necessary to hire those new officers, but Republican Congressional leaders have said they are prepared to devote billions to the wall project while Mr. Trump works with Mexico on funding.\n\nBut funding isn\u2019t the only impediment to building a wall along the southern border \u2013 even if, as Mr. Trump has indicated, the wall does not cover its entire expanse.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, apparently there are a great many of the lands adjacent to the border in private hands, so the government would first have to seize the land by eminent domain or purchase it from the owners and then deal with the construction problems,\u201d Philip Schrag, a Georgetown Law professor and expert on immigration policy, told CBS News.\n\nThe undocumented inside the U.S.\n\nSanctuary cities\n\nIn a September speech on immigration, Mr. Trump promised to \u201cend the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths,\u201d and he said those cities would not receive taxpayer dollars.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday followed through on that promise, signing an executive order that would withhold federal grant money from sanctuary cities.\n\nThe order doesn\u2019t specify what kind of funding could be blocked, although it seems to suggest that the targeted dollars are controlled by the Justice Department and Homeland Security and referred to jurisdictions that bar local officials from communicating with federal authorities about an individual\u2019s immigration status.\n\n\u201cJurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply\u201d with federal immigration laws, the order says, \u201care not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the attorney general or the secretary [of Homeland Security].\u201d\n\nPeter L. Markowitz, a professor at Cardozo Law School in New York, said such an attempt to cut off funding would face strong legal challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution prohibits the president from defunding jurisdictions that won\u2019t do his bidding,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in federal law that requires localities or states to participate in federal immigration enforcement. Second, the Constitution grants Congress - not the president - the power to determine how federal dollars are spent.\u201d\n\nSanctuary cities offer safe harbor for undocumented immigrants who might otherwise be deported by federal immigration law enforcement officials. According to a Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report last year, there are over 140 sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities and counties -- across the U.S., including at least 37 cities -- San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Miami and Los Angeles, among others.\n\nThe mayors of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, San Jose, Oakland, and Austin, among others, said they\u2019d defy the order. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, however, abandoned the sanctuary status over the fear that his city would lose millions in federal funding.\n\nThe order also called for the hiring of 10,000 additional immigration officers for law enforcement, subject to the availability of funding.", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/29/74fec7cd-def5-4d72-a84e-4b189f5963bf/thumbnail/1200x630/e2698dc8eac1d813e02ce96ad537d52e/copley-2017-01-29t203550z-2086939065-rc1f306cbcc0-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-immigration.jpg", "publishedDate": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 20:54:33 -0500", "summary": "The new president signed three executive orders addressing border security, law enforcement, national security and refugees -- here's what they do", "source": "CBS News", "authors": [], "keywords": ["trump", "wall", "executive", "immigration", "order", "federal", "trumps", "mr", "president", "security", "border", "orders", "know"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Allies warn Trump's travel ban will be \"lifeline\" for ISIS", "url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-travel-ban-us-allies-diplomats-cables-isis-retaliation-muslim-world/", "text": "WASHINGTON -- American diplomats in four majority-Muslim nations have sent cables this week to the State Department warning that U.S. allies fear jihadists will use President Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban on people from seven nations, and all refugees, as a propaganda tool, and that Western installations in the Middle East could face retaliation.\n\nThe cables, seen Monday by CBS News, came over the course of just 24 hours from diplomats in Qatar, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. Of those nations, only Sudan is among the seven from which travelers are now barred entry to the United States under President Trump\u2019s executive order. All four are political allies and partners with the U.S. on security matters.\n\nIn each cable, the characterizations of the reactions to the ban from the public, press and social media were the same: outrage and condemnation.\n\nThe cable from Qatar included warnings that the executive order will fuel ISIS propaganda and undermine the U.S.-led counter-ISIS coalition\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cYou could not have given our adversaries better propaganda material,\u201d a senior Qatari official told U.S. diplomats, adding that the travel ban would be \u201cfront-page material\u201d for ISIS\u2019 online propaganda magazines. He predicted that jihadists would use the ban to try and shore up recruitment, just as ISIS numbers are showing real signs of decline. \u201cThe timing of this has given the group a lifeline.\u201d\n\nThose concerns were echoed Monday by former CIA deputy director Mike Morell, who told CBS News he believed the Executive Order, \u201cis going to make the threat worse. It is going to make us less safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s playing right into the ISIS narrative. ISIS has not said anything about this yet, but people around ISIS, who amplify its message, are talking about it, and they are saying, \u2018See? We told you, this is a war against Islam.\u2019 So this is going to be a recruitment boon for ISIS,\u201d Morell said.\n\nA Senior Qatari military official said, according to the cable from that country viewed by CBS News, that ISIS could exploit tensions between Iraqis and U.S. military personnel in the ongoing operation to liberate Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul, from the terror group.\n\n\u201cCoalition support, particularly the on-the-ground presence of U.S. forces, could be in jeopardy,\u201d said the Qatari military official.\n\nCBS News has spoken to people with first-hand knowledge of the operation in question -- Iraqi military commanders on the ground -- who have lamented Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban and expressed concerns that it may complicate the vital cooperation between U.S. and Iraqi forces.\n\nGen. Talib al Kenani commands the elite, American-trained counter-terrorism forces that have led the fight against ISIS for two years.\n\n\u201cThere are many American troops here in Iraq,\u201d he told CBS News at his fortified compound in Baghdad. \u201cAfter this ban, how are we supposed to deal with each other?\u201d\n\nAl Kenani believes the \u201cban needs to be reviewed\u2026 We thought we were partners with our American friends, and now we realize that we\u2019re just considered terrorists.\u201d\n\nAn official from Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told American diplomats the travel ban could embolden jihadists groups to strike at Western targets or key U.S. partners \u2013 including his own country.\n\n\u201cThis ban is like a target on the backs of all Muslim U.S. allies in the region,\u201d the official said.\n\nThere was also concern that the Executive Order could bolster Iran\u2019s role in the Middle East. According to the senior Qatari military official: \u201cQatar\u2019s military establishment is concerned that the move could embolden Iranian activity in Iraq and further increase sectarian tensions in an unstable region.\u201d\n\nSudan -- which is included in the temporary ban along with Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen -- \u201cexpressed frustration\u201d that the order came despite U.S.-Sudanese cooperation on counterterrorism.\n\nThe U.S. Charge d\u2019affaires was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Khartoum for an explanation. U.S. officials were asked, \u201cwhat Sudan had done to merit such treatment,\u201d as there was confusion as to why the country had been included in the list of seven.\n\nThe general population in Sudan, according to the cable sent to Washington, sees the travel ban as \u201can affront to their national pride.\u201d\n\nA Sudanese opposition leader \u201cwarned against taking steps seen by the Muslim population to be extremist as Muslim extremists would use it to their advantage.\u201d\n\nWith sanctions on Sudan lifted just before President Obama left office, the government \u201cexpressed concern that the timing of the ban coincided with a time when Sudanese businesspeople needed to travel to the U.S. to build new relationships.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cable from the U.S. Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the public there has been vocal in its denouncement of the ban, labelling it \u201cIslamophobic,\u201d and voicing concerns they could be added to the list.\n\nIn the cable from Indonesia, diplomats said government officials expressed their \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d with the ban, while the largest circulation newspaper called it \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and \u201cracist,\u201d and warned the move could spark acts of \u201crevenge\u201d by other countries.", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/14/2627f606-e74d-4d04-a7c2-a5db67e5f2d4/thumbnail/1200x630/ab480fe8293eae2a611367ef95e06371/mosulu.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:19:48 -0500", "summary": "American diplomats in Muslim world have sent assessments back to Washington, and overwhelming message is a stark warning from our allies", "source": "CBS News", "authors": [], "keywords": ["official", "isis", "trump", "lead", "sudan", "travel", "muslim", "retaliation", "diplomats", "order", "warn", "military", "ban", "world", "told", "cable", "help"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump to sign cyber security executive order", "url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cybersecurity-executive-order/", "text": "The president is expected to sign an executive order on cyber security at 3:15 p.m. The order will advise agency and department heads that they will be held accountable for cyber security, CBS News\u2019 Mark Knoller reports.\n\nAgency and department heads will be directed by the executive order to use the best practices from the private sector to enhance cyber security.

There is no denying that the Electoral College was intended to address specific American realities when the Constitution was being written in 1787. And there weren\u2019t any other electoral democracies around in those days to look to for inspiration and ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes overlooked that in 2004 we could have had yet another disconnect between the Electoral College outcome and popular vote totals.\n\nWith 60,000 flipped votes in Ohio, John Kerry John KerryTake it from Italy's past, don't tinker with US electoral systems Trump\u2019s dangerous move to politicize the National Security Council State Dept. senior management team resigns: report MORE would have won the presidency with almost three million fewer votes than George W. Bush. Presumably that result would have been quite suitable to most people unhappy with how things turned out in 2016.\n\nHowever one feels about the Electoral College, though, its abolition would require amending the Constitution, and that is not going to happen.\n\nIt is actually a good thing, in my view, that the U.S. election system is not easy to change, especially when it comes to the highest-stakes elections. It is one thing to talk about a reform in the national interest, but in fact quite unreasonable to expect political parties and other organizations involved in a reform effort to see it as anything other than an effort to promote their specific interests. A cautionary tale is coming these days from our friends and allies in Italy.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Italy has experimented with various electoral systems for its two houses of parliament, which in essence \u201celect\u201d the government.\n\nThe Italian Constitution does not specify what system to use for electing legislators, but the drafters of the country\u2019s 1948 constitution clearly favored a proportional system, in which a party\u2019s percentage share of the vote would determine the share of seats it held in the legislature.\n\nIn the postwar Italian system, even small parties could make it into parliament, and coalition governments became the norm. Proportional systems are very good at representing the specific political preferences of voters, less good at producing stable, long-term governing majorities. Italian voters, however, lived quite happily through dozens of government reshuffles. Very few of them sincerely wanted a return to the strong executive power of the Mussolini era, and the political system reflected that.\n\nSince that system imploded, however, with the end of the Cold War, followed by corruption investigations that destroyed the parties that had governed for over forty years, the Italians have tried various approaches to creating more solid and stable governing majorities, able to deal better with an increasingly complex international scene.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2005, they tried a somewhat more British-style electoral system, with most legislators elected by simple majority as sole representative of a given district, while retaining some proportional distribution of votes as a lifeline to small parties. Distinctly confusing.\n\nIn 2005, the Berlusconi government pushed through a new electoral law that returned fully to proportional representation, and was intended to assign a hefty bonus to the biggest vote getter \u2013 a guaranteed majority of over 50 percent of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate.\n\nIn the end, this system did not have the anticipated huge benefits for Berlusconi\u2019s center-right coalition. They lost very narrowly to the center-left in 2006, though they won handily in early elections two years later.\n\nIn 2013, the law worked again to the benefit of the center-left, when it narrowly beat Berlusconi\u2019s center-right coalition in nation-wide totals and got a solid majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The region-by-region system for Senate elections, on the other hand, produced only a very narrow plurality for the center-left, with the populist 5 Star Movement running a strong third.\n\nMatteo Renzi, leader of the center-left Democratic Party and prime minister from February 2014 to December 2016, tried a major restructuring of the political system. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nVoters rejected his efforts to revamp the Senate, and the Constitutional Court, which performs part of the functions of the U.S. Supreme Court, has just heavily modified Renzi\u2019s 2015 law on elections to the Chamber of Deputies. It was intended to favor the big political parties, like his own, by introducing a second round of balloting between the two biggest vote getters from the first round, with the winner receiving \u2014 wait for it \u2014 a bonus to ensure a solid majority.\n\nThe parts of the law still in effect do foresee a prize for a party that manages to get 40 percent of the vote in the one round of balloting, to guarantee it 54 percent of seats in the Chamber. The Democrats and the 5 Star Movement are both polling around 30 percent, far from the 40 percent threshold, but the constitutional referendum in December indicated how undercounting of populist votes by pollsters is a problem in Italy, not just in the U.S.\n\nThe current obsession of the Italian political mainstream, not surprisingly, is to make sure that the electoral system does not produce a governing majority for the populists in the next parliamentary elections, which have to take place by early 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated story, and not an encouraging one. When Italy\u2019s political leaders started fiddling with the electoral system back in the early 1990s, they opened the proverbial Pandora\u2019s box.\n\nThe stated objective of providing governments with more solid majorities in parliament, and presumably the ability to act in more determined and incisive fashion, makes sense.\n\nThe problem is that all the multiple revisions of the electoral system have been intended to serve the specific, sometimes transitory, interests of the political forces that have pushed them through. This risks feeding popular disgust with governing elites, which is a powerful driver of support for populist movements.\n\nThose in democratic societies who feel a compelling desire to modify electoral systems should look carefully at the Italian experience, and weigh the risks of going down a similar path. Sometimes it truly is better to do nothing.\n\nExamples are abundant. Rather than relying on re-engineering of electoral systems, we should focus on doing a better job of politics.\n\nEric R.

She should reconsider.\n\nBrexit Really Was About Immigration.\n\nNigel Farage, the UK Independence Party, made clear that the number one issue in forcing Brexit was immigration.\n\nWhile polling says Brexit was about \u201csovereignty\u201d, the polling may reflect something akin to the \u201cBradley Effect\u201d, where voters lie to pollsters to hide their racial prejudice, but as applied to immigrants.\n\nBut even if that is not the case, immigration was a major factor for \u201cLeave\u201d voters. According to the Lord Ashcroft poll after the Brexit vote:\n\n\u201c(33 percent) said the main reason was that leaving \u2018offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.\u2019 Just over one in eighth (13%) said remaining would mean having no choice \u2018about how the EU expanded its membership or its powers in the years ahead.\u2019\u201d\n\nA solid 46 percent, then, were concerned, directly or indirectly, about the UK future of UK immigration.\n\nThe Wrong Hill to Die For\n\nIt seems an odd choice for Merkel to center her intransigence in the Brexit negotiations on the EU\u2019s freedom of movement.\n\nThe rules covering \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d in Europe are complex and disparate and apply in varying degrees to EU members and non-EU members through the Schengen Agreement, an element of EU aquis, or law.\n\nGermany is among the most liberal European nations with respect to immigration, and fully adheres to the Schengen Agreement, but Britain has never signed on to it (save for some law enforcement protocols).\n\nIndeed, the UK and Ireland have the strictest rules for migration from within the EU of any of the EU nations. While EU residents traveling within the Schengen Area, which is different from the EU, are able to travel without a passport or national identity card, they cannot enter the UK without such documents.\n\nA Triple Threat of Risk\n\nMerkel\u2019s position on immigration presents an array of risks: first, to her own political future; next, to the liberal democratic norms of Europe; and, finally, to Germany\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Risk to Merkel\u2019s Chancellorship\n\nMerkel\u2019s popularity see-sawed in the fall, following the Nice terror attacks. But the Berlin Christmas Market attack did not significantly damage Merkel\u2019s popularity. It has, however, induced her to take a harder line on immigration.\n\nStill, Merkel\u2019s Chancellorship remains at risk:\n\nGermany\u2019s \u201cAlternatives for Germany\u201d (AfD) party, avowed opponents of immigration, beat Merkel\u2019s party by two points in bundesland, or state, elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Merkel\u2019s home district. (Her Christian Democrat Union (CDU) party maintained control of the bundesland legislature with a coalition of its Federal Republic coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU)).\n\nLast week, the leader of the party that is the strongest challenger to Merkel\u2019s chancellorship, the German Social Democrats (SPD), pulled even with Merkel in polling for the coming chancellor\u2019s race. That leader, Martin Schulz, a left of center former EU Parliament president, will run against the center-right Merkel when a chancellor is selected by the victors of the German Bundesrat (parliament) elections later this year.\n\nEarlier this month, Merkel\u2019s governing coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU) reiterated its call for a 200,000 cap on migrants, a demand it has had since at least last fall.\n\nWhile there is little doubt Germany will retain a mostly centrist government, it may not retain Merkel as chancellor.\n\nThe Risk to Europe\n\nPlaying the \u201cimmigration card\u201d in the Brexit negotiations risks the entirety of the EU because it virtually assures that hardline, anti-EU, anti-immigration, nationalists, like France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, who currently leads polls in France, Holland\u2019s Geert Wilders, and the other EU nationalist leaders will use Merkel\u2019s intransigence on immigration to build broader populist political support among their respective nations\u2019 electorate.\n\nIf they\u2019re successful, Britain\u2019s exit from the EU may be just the first of more EU member nations to leave.\n\nThe Risk to Germany\u2019s Economy\n\nGermany is, perhaps, the biggest de facto currency manipulator in the G-8. It has the second highest trade surplus as a percentage of GDP (after Holland) of any leading exporting country, including China and was added to a \u201cwatch list\u201d of currency manipulators by the Treasury last year.\n\nWhile manipulator countries usually sell their own currency for that of other nations to lower the value of the home country currency, Germany\u2019s manipulation is more subtle.\n\nGermany props up the weaker EU economies of Southern Europe with a policy that bankers call \u201cextend and pretend:\u201d lending good money after bad, with the expectation the loans are unlikely to be repaid or, at best, that their terms will be extended far into the future. That keeps the weaker economies in the Eurozone and reduces the value of the euro relative to other currencies, the same objective of traditional manipulators.\n\nBy empowering rightists, populists and nationalists in the EU, Merkel risks Germany\u2019s own version of \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d as the strongest export economy in Europe.\n\nIf Merkel helps the rightists, nationalists and populists come to power in Europe, as discussed above, she puts the euro at risk. If Eurozone governments return to their own sovereign currencies, Germany\u2019s export economy will suffer substantially because its exports would be more expensive. Even Germany\u2019s \u201cextend and pretend\u201d loan portfolio to poorer EU countries will require a substantial write-down that could throw Germany into a deep recession.\n\nAll this points to May very possibly being better able to steer Britain through Brexit better than Angela Merkel can steer Germany \u2013 and the EU \u2013 through the change.\n\nThe chancellor would be wise, then, to tread carefully in trying to impose free movement as a condition for the UK\u2019s access to its market. It is a decidedly unpopular policy with a large segment of European voters.\n\nMerkel\u2019s migration policy was even contested Sunday by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, her powerful finance minister. Notably, Sch\u00e4uble reacted strenuously to Theresa May\u2019s threat to make Britain a tax haven in her speech of January 17th. But his support for EU freedom of movement has been much more muted.\n\nSch\u00e4uble, an erudite, conservative, politician who has sometimes been more popular than Merkel, has likely already surmised the political risks of continuing the free movement issue and has set other priorities for Germany in the Brexit negotiations.\n\nChancellor Merkel would be wise to follow his lead.\n\nJ.G.

Nelson said he is concerned Chao wasn't consulted by the administration on drafting the order, but urged his colleagues to support her so that Chao could work with the White House on critical issues in the future.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I found out in that conversation was the nominee to be the secretary of Transportation had not been consulted by the White House, not in advance, not during, not after, the implementation of those orders,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe need Secretary Chao as someone who \u2026 will be in a position to offer level-headed, good experience-based advice to the government going forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow that she\u2019s confirmed, Chao hopes to establish an infrastructure \"task force\" to start exploring the best ways to upgrade the nation\u2019s ailing transportation system.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nWASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday met with top executives from some of the biggest drugmakers, calling on them to boost U.S. production and lower prices, while he also promised to speed up approval times for new medicines.\n\nTrump reiterated that the government was paying too much for medicines in its health programs for older, disabled and poor people and said he would soon appoint a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration leader.\n\nAt the same time, the meeting between Trump and the pharmaceutical executives signaled a defusing of tensions between the two that have kept drug stocks in check since the presidential election. Shares of most of the group rallied Tuesday following the meeting, even as the broader stock market slid.\n\nHigh drug prices have become a national issue during the past two years as healthcare costs rise. Pharmaceutical stocks have seesawed since Trump was elected, rising on hopes that he would not enact changes and more recently falling on comments about what actions he might take to lower their prices.\n\n\u201cTrump is a populist above all else, and having these (drug) prices skyrocket, he\u2019s commented that under his administration, this is not going to happen,\u201d said market strategist Quincy Krosby of Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nShe said Trump was playing a balancing act between controlling prices and loosening regulations. \"I don\u2019t think the majority of Americans want all regulations lifted from drug makers.\u201d\n\nAttending the meeting were top executives at Merck & Co Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen Inc and Switzerland's Novartis AG as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America lobbying group.\n\nAccording to a transcript of the televised portion of the meeting, Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway promised to add 1,600 U.S. jobs at his California-based biotechnology company.\n\nLilly and Merck said by email after the meeting that they were encouraged by Trump's focus on innovation.\n\nLilly said discussion topics also included stronger trade agreements, tax reform and removing \"outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation.\"\n\n\"Tax, deregulation - those are things that could really help us expand operations,\" Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said.\n\nOfficials at the other companies did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.\n\nShares of the six companies were mostly higher, for an overall gain averaging 0.7 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in the broad S&P 500. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 0.9 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the S&P 500 health care index gained 0.6 percent.\n\n\"ASTRONOMICAL\" PRICING\n\nTrump told the drugmakers that pricing had been \"astronomical.\"\n\n\"We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid,\" Trump said, citing the nation's government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled that together are the largest U.S. purchaser of medications.\n\nTrump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers' outsourcing their production, and he called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States.\n\nForeign countries must pay fair share for drug development costs, he added. \"We're going to end global freeloading.\"\n\nThe United States typically pays more for drugs than any other developed nation.\n\nNovartis CEO Joe Jimenez, who is chairman-elect of the industry lobbying group, said last week that he wanted to talk to Trump about efforts to develop pricing models that would pay for clinical results rather than a flat price per pill, as well as plans to replace the Affordable Care Act, which is popularly known as \"Obamacare.\"\n\nTrump spooked pharmaceutical and biotech investors by saying on Jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were \"getting away with murder\" on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it.\n\nCompany executives, meanwhile, have tried to tread a careful line in defending their industry while expressing optimism that the United States would continue to reward scientific advances.\n\n\"Regulations - great, streamlining the FDA, perhaps,\" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago said. \"But if Trump is going to address his constituency, drug prices have to come down.

Democrats said they were delaying because they wanted more information on Price's stock trades in an Australian medical company and reports that Mnuchin's former bank, OneWest, used automated \"robo-signings\" of foreclosure documents, which apparently contradicted statements the nominees had made to senators.\n\nRepublican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called the Democratic boycott \"shocking\" and \"offensive.\"\n\n\"They're going to vote no. They've made that very clear,\" he said to other Republicans on the committee. \"I think they ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots. What's the matter with the other party? Are they that bitter about Donald Trump?\"\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters Democrats were not ready to consider either nominee.\n\n\"We've made clear that we need additional information to make these judgments,\" he said.\n\nIt was unclear when the committee votes could be held. But a spokesman for Wyden, Taylor Harvey, indicated it was not the Democrats' intention to leave the two nominees in limbo indefinitely. \"Our hope is we can resolve these issues and continue the markup (voting) soon,\" he said.\n\nThe Democrats said they wanted more information about Price and Mnuchin after media reports appeared to contradict statements that they had made in confirmation hearings and subsequent written statements.\n\nIn Mnuchin's case, the Columbus Dispatch newspaper cited documents showing that OneWest used automated \u201crobo-signings\u201d - a method for approving mortgage documents that was criticized for not fully considering them - after the former Goldman Sachs executive and OneWest chairman flatly denied those practices to senators.\n\nWyden said Democrats also wanted more information about a Wall Street Journal article that said Price received a privileged offer to buy a biomedical stock at a discount, contrary to his congressional testimony this month.\n\nPrice had testified the discounted shares he bought in Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd were available to all other investors at the time but the Journal said that in fact he was one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors who were invited last year to buy the discounted shares.\n\n\"The company is directly contradicting Congressman Price, indicating he didn\u2019t tell the truth. And he misled the Congress and he misled the American people,\" Wyden said.\n\nBarney Keller, a spokesman for Mnuchin\u2019s transition, dismissed the Ohio newspaper\u2019s report as \"bogus,\" saying courts had already rejected allegations that a OneWest official\u2019s signings of documents cited in the report were \"robo-signings.\"\n\n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell and David Lawder; Editing by Bill Trott and Cynthia Osterman)", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170131&t=2&i=1170882800&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED0U0ZK", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:24:05 -0500", "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday boycotted a planned committee vote on two of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees, Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Tom Price to head the Health and Human Services department, postponing the vote.", "source": "Reuters", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "David Lawder"], "keywords": ["information", "documents", "onewest", "senate", "price", "boycott", "delay", "nominees", "wyden", "democrats", "committee", "vote", "mnuchin", "wanted"], "tags": ["politicsNews"]}, {"title": "Trump to name U.S. high court pick on Tuesday as Democrats plan fight", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/c8jMAwNRvcI/us-usa-court-trump-idUSKBN15F1OW", "text": "(L-R) William Pryor, a judge on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and Thomas Hardiman, who serves on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump was set to unveil his pick for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday as Democrats, still fuming over the Republican-led Senate's refusal to act on former President Barack Obama's nominee last year, girded for a fight.\n\nTrump has announced he would reveal his choice to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, at the White House at 8 p.m. (0100 GMT on Wednesday).\n\nThe court is ideologically split with four conservative justices and four liberals, and Trump's pick can restore its conservative majority.\n\nA source involved in the selection process said Trump has made his choice between two conservative U.S. appeals court judges appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe two contenders are Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and Thomas Hardiman, who serves on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the source said.\n\nCNN, citing an unnamed source, said Gorsuch has been told he is the likely choice. The network also reported that both Gorsuch and Hardiman were being brought to Washington ahead of the announcement.\n\nWilliam Pryor, a judge on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, had earlier been mentioned as a possible nominee.\n\nA senior Senate Republican aide said that at a meeting on Monday night, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had been informed of Trump's pick and that it is an \"outstanding choice.\"\n\nUnder the Constitution, a president's Supreme Court nomination requires Senate confirmation.\n\nAmid partisan tension since Trump took office, Democrats remain enraged because Republican McConnell refused last year to allow the Senate to consider Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for the vacant seat. That action has little precedent in U.S. history.\n\nGambling that Republicans would win the presidency in the Nov. 8 election, McConnell argued that Obama's successor should get to make the pick. The move paid off with Trump's victory, but the court has run shorthanded for nearly a full year.\n\nA Supreme Court justice can have influence in national affairs for decades after the president who made the appointment has left office. Some Democrats have said the Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat from Obama by refusing to confirm Garland.\n\nDemocratic Senator Jeff Merkley has vowed to pursue a procedural hurdle called a filibuster for Trump's nominee, meaning 60 votes would be needed in the 100-seat Senate unless its long-standing rules are changed. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a 52-48 majority, meaning some Democratic votes would be needed to confirm his pick.\n\n\"We need to fight this Constitution-shredding gambit with everything we've got,\" Merkley said in a statement.\n\nCONTENTIOUS ISSUES\n\nTrump's appointee could be pivotal in cases involving abortion, gun, religious and transgender rights, the death penalty and other contentious matters.\n\nMcConnell on Monday warned Democrats that senators should respect Trump's election victory and give the nominee \"careful consideration followed by an up-or-down vote,\" not a filibuster.\n\nTrump, who took office on Jan. 20, said last week he would favor Senate Republicans eliminating the filibuster, a change dubbed the \"nuclear option,\" for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats block his pick.\n\nGorsuch, Hardiman and Pryor have strong conservative credentials.\n\nGorsuch, 49, joined an opinion in 2013 saying that owners of private companies can object on religious grounds to a provision of the Obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women.\n\nHardiman, 51, has embraced a broad interpretation of the constitutional guarantee of the right to bear arms and has backed the right of schools to restrict student speech.\n\nPryor, 54, has been an outspoken critic of the court's 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion, calling it \"the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.\"\n\nConservatives are hoping the high court will back restrictions imposed on abortion by some Republican-governed states.\n\nSince it had only eight members after Scalia's death, the court has steered clear of some controversial issues.

He has rejected what he called the \"ethno-nationalist\" tendencies of some in the movement.\n\nAfter becoming chief executive of Trump's election campaign in August, the former Goldman Sachs banker and Navy veteran helped lead him to victory over Clinton.

The White House said Yates \"has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States\" and portrayed her actions as political.\n\nTrump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect America from terror attacks but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out Muslims and defiles America's historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants.\n\nYates, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, was days away from being replaced by Trump's pick for the top spot at the Justice Department, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\n\"Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe White House said that Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was sworn in at 9 p.m. ET and would be acting U.S. attorney general until Sessions is approved.\n\nBoente said in an interview with the Washington Post that he would enforce the immigration order.\n\nDRAMA\n\nThere have been only a handful of instances in U.S. history of top Justice Department officials publicly breaking with the White House.\n\nThe most famous example was in 1973, when then-Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned rather than obey President Richard Nixon\u2019s order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe incident, which became known as the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" was a public relations disaster and is seen as a turning point in Nixon's administration.\n\nThe drama at the Justice Department is another sign of how hastily Trump's immigration order was developed and how little it was reviewed by the agencies now grappling to implement it.\n\nThe White House said key government officials were briefed before Trump signed the order on Friday, but there was little coordination or consultation, resulting in confusion. Most State Department officials found out about it from media reports.\n\nOfficials from the State Department circulated a draft memo of dissent on Monday, saying Trump's move would hurt America's image abroad and inflame anti-American sentiment.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed the memo. \"These career bureaucrats have a problem with it? I think that they should either get with the program or they can go,\" he told reporters at his daily briefing.\n\nAn internal Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters showed 348 visa holders were kept from boarding U.S.-bound flights this week, and more than 200 people came to the United States but were denied entry.\n\nMore than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at airports, including 394 green card holders, who are legal permanent residents of the United States, the document said.\n\nTrump's administration is granting waivers from the refugee ban to allow 872 people into the country this week - refugees that had already been cleared for resettlement in the United States and were in transit when the order came out.\n\nTens of thousands of people protested Trump's order in major American cities and at airports on the weekend.\n\nObama took the rare step of weighing in, saying through a spokesman that he was heartened by the political activism on the issue.\n\nEmployees of Alphabet Inc's Google in San Francisco, Mountain View, Seattle and other cities held protests. Backed by a sign that said \"We are a nation of immigrants,\" Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet, said he was outraged by the order.\n\n\"The U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees,\u201d he said in a YouTube video of his remarks.\n\nTECH BACKING FOR COURT CHALLENGES\n\nFederal judges blocked deportation of those detained under the order through the weekend, and more lawsuits were filed on Monday.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country's biggest Muslim advocacy group, filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 people.\n\nWashington state filed a lawsuit, arguing that Trump\u2019s order violates the equal protection clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Several other Democratic state attorneys general have said they are considering legal action.\n\n\"It is an insult and a danger to all of the people of the state of Washington, of all faiths,\" Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, told reporters.\n\nAmazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc, both of which are based in Washington state's Seattle area, are supporting the state's suit.\n\nAmazon scrapped a business trip for a senior company lawyer who was born in Libya but has UK citizenship, according to a declaration filed in support of the lawsuit. Forty-nine of its employees were born in one of the banned countries, and seven new hires may need to be placed in offices outside the United States, it said.\n\nA declaration from Expedia said the order could impact the travel itineraries of at least 1,000 customers, costing it refunds as well as expenses to monitor how the order is applied and who exactly is affected.\n\nThe U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, has been the most vocal corporate opponent to Trump's order. A group of top companies plans to meet on Tuesday to discuss how best to support legal challenges.

Many said they first learned it had been enacted through the news media.\n\nThe order and its unveiling was led by Stephen Miller, Trump's senior policy adviser who worked extensively on immigration issues in the office of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he became aware of the executive order \"at the time it was being issued\" and he was briefed \"as it rolled out.\" He added he had a \"good\" conversation with John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on Monday and they agreed in the future to \"make sure things are done correctly.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, told members in the House GOP Conference meeting today that he gave his staff permission to volunteer for the transition and that work ended on January 20th, according to multiple sources.\n\nGoodlatte did not indicate whether he knew about the non-disclosure agreements and this particular executive order, but sources said he insisted that his staff had nothing to with the rollout of the order, which he echoed in a statement after the meeting.\n\n\"My staff on the House Judiciary Committee are some of the best on Capitol Hill. They are experts in their respective fields and I proudly allowed them to provide their expertise to the Trump transition team on immigration law,\" he said in a statement Tuesday morning.\n\n\"To be clear, while they gave advice to the new administration, they did not have decision making authority on the policy,\" he continued. \"The final decision was made at the highest levels of the Trump Administration and I support the President\u2019s executive order.

He deferred to the House Judiciary Committee on further details and was not asked directly about the NDAs.\n\nRyan stressed it is the president\u2019s chief responsibility to keep Americans safe, but admitted it is \"regrettable\" there was confusion over the weekend on the particulars of the executive order.\n\nHe dismissed criticism of the order, pointing to the SAFE Act that passed through the House in the wake of the Paris massacre. He said he is supportive of the government\u2019s refugee resettlement program, but said it requires proper review and vetting.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with taking a pause,\" he said.", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ap-house-judiciary-committe-jc-170131_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:38:15 -0500", "summary": "An unusual move, staff were allegedly asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement.", "source": "ABC News", "authors": ["John Parkinson", "More John", "More Benjamin", "Abc News"], "keywords": ["transition", "trump", "allegedly", "house", "executive", "agreement", "signed", "immigration", "work", "committee", "presidents", "worked", "nondisclosure", "order", "congressional", "staff"], "tags": ["Politics"]}, {"title": "Democrats Boycott Committee Votes on Trump Cabinet Nominees", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-boycott-committee-votes-trumps-picks-treasury-health/story?id=45168280", "text": "Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee this morning boycotted scheduled votes for two of President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, arguing the nominees had lied to the committee about their business or investment dealings.\n\nThe move seemed to take Republicans on the committee by surprise and effectively stalled the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep.

He held a printout of a newspaper article in the Columbus Post-Dispatch this week that argues Mnuchin \u201cmisled\u201d the Senate about the mortgage practices of a bank he helped to run.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to this committee today, because we want the committee to regroup, get the information, have these two nominees come back in front of the committee, clarify what they lied about. And I hope they'd apologize about that,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSenator Wyden (D-Oregon), ranking member of the Finance Committee, cited a different story about Price, specifically calling into question whether the congressman benefited from knowledge he had as a legislator working on health care issues when making stock trades. Price has disputed these allegations.\n\n\"The congressman has insisted that he didn't get special access to a special deal. Now we have reports that the company says otherwise ... an indicator that [Price] didn\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d Wyden said. \"At a minimum I believe the committee should postpone this vote so we have an opportunity to talk to the company officials.\u201d", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ap-ron-wyden-block-HHS-ps-170131_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:41:14 -0500", "summary": "Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee boycotted scheduled votes.", "source": "ABC News", "authors": ["Abc News", "More Maryalice"], "keywords": ["votes", "human", "lied", "vote", "price", "hatch", "specifically", "picks", "nominees", "health", "trumps", "committee", "treasury", "services", "wyden", "boycott", "today", "democrats"], "tags": ["Politics"]}, {"title": "How the Trump Administration Is Justifying the List of Countries Banned", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-justifying-list-countries-banned-travel-us/story?id=45143197", "text": "The controversial temporary immigration ban that President Trump initiated via executive order sparked public outcry over the weekend and now his administration is trying to explain the move -- including how the seven affected countries were chosen.\n\nTrump's top advisers say that the countries highlighted in the ban were the same ones identified by the Obama administration as countries of concern, given their history of ties to terrorism.\n\nBut what the Trump administration did not mention was that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Obama administration did not ban citizens from those countries outright.\n\nThe Obama administration did raise the option of not granting visa waivers to anyone who had traveled to those countries since March 1, 2011, but it gave exceptions to some people, such as aid workers and journalists.\n\nTrump said in a statement that they expect visa issuance to all those countries to resume at some point once vetting procedures have been strengthened. However, top Trump advisers have left the door open to adding more countries to the banned list.\n\nWho Was Banned and Why\n\nThe fact sheet issued by DHS on Sunday states the U.S. will bar \"nearly all travelers\" from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen from entering the United States for at least 90 days.\n\nDHS also clarified on Sunday that these countries were chosen because they \"were designated by Congress and the Obama Administration as posing national security risks in the Visa Waiver Program.\"\n\nIn February 2016, during President Obama's final year in office, the Department of Homeland Security added Libya, Somalia and Yemen as \"countries of concern\" to an existing list that included Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Syria. What that meant was that by being listed as such a country, it limited \"Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries since March 1, 2011.\"\n\nThe DHS statement clearly listed a number of groups that would generally be granted waivers and allowed in the U.S. allowed in the U.S. without visas, and while the agency noted that the waivers would be given on a case-by-case basis, \"as a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty; on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; or as a journalist for reporting purposes.\"\n\n\"Individuals impacted will still be able to apply for a visa using the regular immigration process at our embassies or consulates,\" the DHS statement added. \"For those who need a U.S. visa for urgent business, medical, or humanitarian travel to the United States, U.S. embassies and consulates stand ready to provide visa interview appointments on an expedited basis. The new law does not ban travel to the United States, or admission into the United States, and the great majority of Visa Waiver Program travelers will not be affected.\"\n\nThe flow of refugees from Iraq was drastically curtailed for six months in 2011, after the FBI discovered two Iraqi refugees connected to al Qaeda had made it into the U.S. and were plotting attacks from their new home in Kentucky. American officials told ABC News they carried out a top-to-bottom review of the vetting process to close loopholes back then.\n\nThe DHS fact sheet released on Sunday also noted that legal permanent residents -- that is, green card holders -- are exempt from the travel restrictions, as are people who hold dual citizenship. But the text of Trump's executive order does not specify that.\n\nHowever, the \"countries of concern\" list was not the only explanation the Trump administration has given for implementing a travel ban.\n\nThe original text of the executive order, released Friday, Jan. 27, notes the \"crucial role\" the visa-issuance process plays in \"detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States.\"\n\n\"Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans,\" the executive order states.\n\nThe executive order states that the visa-issuance process was amended following the 9/11 terror attacks to prevent would-be terrorists from getting visas but still failed to stop attacks by foreign nationals admitted into the U.S.\n\nNone of the countries impacted by the Trump travel ban was home to any of the 19 hijackers from the 9/11 attacks -- who were all from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Egypt.\n\nTrump Advisers Address Countries With Known Links to Terror Left Off the List\n\nTrump's top advisers have repeatedly pointed to the list of countries of concern created by the Obama administration as their justification for inclusion in Trump's travel ban.\n\n\"President Trump is merely following President Obama's lead on state sponsored terrorist countries where they have a history of training and exporting and harboring terrorists,\" Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said on ABC News' \"Good Morning America\" Monday.\n\nWhen White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked on Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week\" why terror-prone countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were not included, he said that the administration is \"looking at all of this holistically.\"\n\n\"But I think the first step -- because I think the Obama Administration put these first and foremost so that these countries need to have further travel restrictions based on the intelligence we have. What the president did was take the first step through this executive order of ensuring that we're looking at the entire system,\" he said.\n\nDoes Trump Have Ties to Some Countries Left Off the List?\n\nOf the four countries of origin for the 9/11 hijackers, Trump does have current business interests in United Arab Emirates, but ABC News has not found any known active Trump business deals in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Lebanon.\n\nWhen asked about the absence of these countries from the ban and if that had anything to do with Trump's business interests there, Conway did not specifically answer how his business ties did or did not impact country selection.\n\nWhen ABC News was completing a project about Trump's global business empire earlier this month, the Trump Organization did not provide a response to ABC News' questions about possible business deals or developments in Egypt or Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump's financial disclosure forms listed two inactive companies that may have been related to prospective business interests in Egypt. In the days after the presidential election, the Trump Organization shut down a number of entities in Saudi Arabia that were set up in 2015 and that appeared to be related to prospective business ventures, ABC News learned during its reporting.\n\nTrump\u2019s financial disclosure forms list two inactive companies that may have been related to prospective business interests in Egypt. Trump Marks Egypt Corp. and Trump Marks Egypt LLC have the same incorporation date of Sept. 17, 2007, according to online records of the Delaware Department of State. Trump\u2019s disclosure forms do not indicate any income or activity associated with these entities.\n\nTrump does have confirmed business ties to the United Arab Emirates. He currently has licensing deals in place for two golf courses in Dubai, including one designed by Tiger Woods, that are being developed by the DAMAC group.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, his partners in the deal told ABC News that the Trump brand had become \"stronger, more global.\u201d Hussain Sajwani, the chairman of DAMAC, who is preparing to open the clubhouse for the first of the two 18-hole Trump golf course developments early in 2017, said the project is \u201cbenefiting from that -- the strength of that brand.\u201d\n\nReligious References\n\nOne of the more controversial statements that Trump made during the presidential campaign was his call for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,\" and while his position on the issue evolved during the months that followed, Trump expressed displeasure when people connected this ongoing immigration ban to religion.\n\nAll seven countries that are included in the ban are majority Muslim countries.\n\n\"There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order,\" Trump said on Sunday. He blamed the media for \"falsely reporting\" the details of the executive order he signed on Friday.\n\nOn the same day that Trump signed the executive order, a clip from an interview he gave to the Christian Broadcasting Network was released wherein he said that he will give Christian refugees priority.\n\n\"They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria, it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So, we are going to help them,\" Trump said in a clip of the interview that was released Friday.\n\nTrump did not give any examples or cite evidence to support his claim that it is more difficult for Syrian Christians to gain refugee status than Syrian Muslims.\n\nHe reiterated his claim on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nChristians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers.

He said of the landmark abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade, \"If it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.\"\n\nWhile the replacement of Scalia with another conservative justice is unlikely to realign the Supreme Court in such a way that Roe v. Wade could be threatened, the replacement of additional justices could have major consequences, according to Kate Shaw, an ABC News contributor and a Cardozo School of Law professor. We asked Shaw to help explain how this might work, and she responded via email.\n\nWhat is Roe v. Wade, and what did it do?\n\nKate Shaw: In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution protects a woman's right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. At the time Roe was decided, 1973, many states criminalized abortion, and Roe struck all of those criminal statutes down. Following the decision, states weren't able to prohibit abortion outright, but they do have the power to regulate it.\n\nWhat can states do to regulate abortion?\n\nKS: Roe held that while the Constitution protects a woman's right to decide for herself whether to continue with a pregnancy, states also have a strong interest in regulating abortion, both to protect women's health and to promote potential life.\n\nThe court balanced these competing interests using a trimester framework, holding that during the first trimester of pregnancy, the abortion decision is in the hands of a woman and her doctor. During the second trimester, the state can regulate abortion in ways that are reasonably related to women's health. And in the third trimester, the state's interest in potential life is strong enough to allow states to prohibit abortion outright, except where necessary to preserve a woman's life or health.\n\nIn a 1992 case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court abandoned the trimester framework and held that states have a valid regulatory interest for the duration of a pregnancy. But it also held that prior to viability, states may regulate abortion only so long as the regulations do not impose an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to choose. Under this ruling, states have regulated abortion in a range of ways, from requiring counseling about the availability of adoption to mandating waiting periods to regulating facilities that perform abortions. Earlier this year, in a case out of Texas, the Supreme Court made clear that where states act to regulate abortion facilities, those regulations must be grounded in objective medical standards.\n\nLet's assume Trump appoints a person ideologically in line with Scalia. What will be the court's ideological makeup at that point?\n\nKS: Justice Scalia was a strong opponent of both the Roe and Casey decisions. A jurist who shares Scalia's views in this area would maintain the status quo, which is four strong votes in favor of Roe, four justices who don't believe the Constitution protects the right to abortion, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has voted with either blocs when it comes to abortion (though it's significant that his most recent vote in an abortion case was with the court's liberals). So statutes like the Texas clinic regulation, which Kennedy joined the liberals in striking down, would remain invalid.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nLet's assume liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and swing vote Kennedy retire, leaving open two slots, and then Trump appoints two more conservative justices. How would the court be able to overturn Roe v. Wade?\n\nKS: There are a couple of ways this could happen. First, a state could pass either an outright abortion ban or an extremely restrictive abortion regulation, either of which could set up a test case in which the Supreme Court would be invited to overrule Roe.\n\nIt could also happen more gradually, and I think that's more likely, as the court tends to prefer to act incrementally. The court could uphold a series of abortion regulations, gradually weakening the foundations of the Roe and Casey rulings and then finally overruling those cases.\n\nBut \u2014 and this is a big \"but\" \u2014 there is no absolute guarantee that Roe would be overruled, even with three or more Trump appointees. It's at least possible that the court would decide to adhere to Roe on the grounds that, as Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in 1932, \"In most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" Even a conservative court could decide it would simply be too disruptive to overrule this long-settled precedent on such a divisive social issue. That's essentially what happened in Casey, when everyone thought Roe would be overruled but it wasn't.\n\nWould a ruling against Roe have immediate nationwide impact?\n\nKS: A decision overruling Roe would allow states to ban abortion, but wouldn't require them to do so. And the big question would be which states would do that. A number of states have laws on the books that would essentially ban abortion immediately if Roe is overruled. Other states would likely move quickly to pass such laws. In all, over half of the states would likely eliminate or severely restrict access to abortion inside their borders if Roe is overruled.\n\nIn addition to what happens in the states, it's conceivable that Congress could attempt to ban abortion nationwide. Without any constitutional guarantee of a right to abortion, the main constraints on Congress would be political, not legal.\n\nThis story has been updated", "image": "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/RD-abortion-rights-protesters-hb-170131_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:28:25 -0500", "summary": "President Trump plans to name his pick for the Supreme Court tonight..", "source": "ABC News", "authors": ["More Benjamin", "Abc News"], "keywords": ["supreme", "right", "appointment", "rights", "justice", "court", "abortion", "roe", "states", "trumps", "affect", "v", "trimester", "wade", "regulate"], "tags": ["Politics"]}, {"title": "Judge Neil Gorsuch: What to Know About the Possible SCOTUS Nominee", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-neil-gorsuch-scotus-nominee/story?id=45008516", "text": "ABC News learned last week that Judge Neil Gorsuch was one of the leading contenders to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia's unexpected death last year.\n\nPresident Trump said he would announce his choice for the bench tonight at 8 p.m. from the White House.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the potential Supreme Court justice:\n\nBackground\n\nGorsuch, 49, is currently a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. He was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2006 and confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote.\n\nGorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and then for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. He attended Harvard Law and has a Ph.D. from Oxford, where he was a Marshall Scholar. In legal circles, he\u2019s considered a gifted writer. Like Scalia, he's both a textualist and an originalist.\n\nHe is the author of \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\" which looks at the legal and ethical issues surrounding assisted suicides. In the book, he concludes that any form of euthanasia should not be legalized.\n\nKey opinions\n\nWhen it comes to religious liberties and access to contraception, Gorsuch is a defender of the \"Free Exercise Clause,\" which says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\nGorsuch sided with Christian employers and religious organizations in the Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor cases. The plaintiffs argued for an exemption from the contraception mandate in President Obama's signature health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, due to religious beliefs.\n\nIn the Hobby Lobby case, Gorsuch wrote, \"The ACA\u2019s mandate requires them to violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to criminal procedure, he dissented in the United States v.

Bush.\n\nOpinions\n\nHardiman has weighed in on cases across the legal spectrum.\n\nIn one of his most well-known cases on the Third Circuit, Hardiman agreed with a New Jersey jail's policy of strip-searching all detainees. He wrote that strip-searching detainees who have been arrested for any crime wasn't a violation of the Fourth Amendment restriction on unreasonable searches and seizures. The Supreme Court in 2012 affirmed the decision.\n\nHardiman dissented from the majority ruling that upheld a New Jersey law requiring individuals to show a \u201cdemonstrable need\u201d before receiving a permit to carry a handgun in public. In his dissent, Hardiman argued that the law violated the Second Amendment.\n\nIn another case, the Third Circuit held that a school district could not constitutionally ban an \"I heart boobies\" bracelet students wanted to wear for breast cancer awareness month. Hardiman dissented, arguing that the First Amendment did not protect the bracelets.\n\nHardiman has not weighed in on abortion issues.\n\nWhat Others Are Saying\n\nCompared to other potential Supreme Court contenders, Hardiman hasn't weighed in on \"high-profile\" issues that have the potential to \"inflame the base of either party,\" said Carl W.

That\u2019s when President Trump will announce his Supreme Court nominee. Never has a nominee inherited this kind of political environment, or this kind of freshly challenging issue set. He (and it\u2019s probably a he) will be grilled on executive powers and the specific order that led to the Monday night firing of the acting attorney general. The pressure will be enormous on Democrats to do everything they can \u2013 up to and including filibustering \u2013 to block a nominee who doesn\u2019t answer those kinds of questions, which no nominee is likely to do. And a filibuster would bring the nuclear option to the Senate\u2019s consideration of nominees for the high court \u2013 just another crisis to spend some time with this young administration.\n\nTHE SLEEPER STORY: Democrats are awake now. President Obama is off the bench. Members of Congress are chanting with the protestors. The party has found its cause --blocking the Trump agenda. Just a week ago, talk in Washington was about how Chuck Schumer could be a closer partner to the president than Mitch McConnell. Now, the president is making fun of Schumer\u2019s tears when he appeared alongside people impacted by the travel ban. Add that to the late-night firing of an acting attorney general over an entirely political disagreement and you have a base plus elected officials who are losing any incentive to work with the new president. Democrats can thank the president for showing them the strategy that now seems inevitable for the next four years: stand strong, and stand in his way.\n\nTHE SHINY STORY: For the first time, President Trump got to say, \u201cyou\u2019re fired.\u201d The statement dismissing Sally Yates as acting attorney general is a doozy, accusing her of having \u201cbetrayed the Department of Justice\u201d and being \u201cweak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\u201d Attributed to simply \u201cthe White House,\u201d the statement is fodder for Trump interpreters to read the man and his men. Just as important as the tone of the firing is the sequence of events that led to it, of course. This moment should be remembered for the rise of Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, the duo behind the ideology and language-crafting of the executive order that rocked the world.\n\nTLDR: This evening at 8pm, Donald Trump will announce his nominee for the Supreme Court. It will come just about 24 hours after his firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Yates refused to defend the president's controversial executive order regarding immigration because she said she is not convinced it is \"lawful.\"\n\nPHOTO OF THE DAY: On March 24, 2015 after Sally Yates was nominated for Deputy Attorney General she had this interesting exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions, now Trump's AG nominee. Sessions asked Yates: \"Do you think the Attorney General has a responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that's improper?\" Her answer: \"Senator, I believe that the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General has an obligation to follow the law and the constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president.\" (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nNOTABLES\n\n--TRUMP SET TO ANNOUNCE HIS SUPREME COURT PICK TONIGHT: President Trump this week said he would announce his nominee for U.S. Supreme Court justice Tuesday night, replacing the vacancy left by the late Antonin Scalia. The court has had only eight justices since Scalia's unexpected death last February. Judge Neil Gorsuch, 49, of the 10th Circuit, and 3rd Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman, 51, top Trump\u2019s short list of potential Supreme Court nominees, according to officials with knowledge of the decision. The decision is expected to be announced tonight at 8 p.m. ET from the White House, said Trump.

Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community,\" the statement said. \"The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression.\" http://abcn.ws/2jypVN3\n\n--TRUMP FIRES ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL SALLY YATES FOR REFUSING TO DEFEND IMMIGRATION ORDER: The acting U.S. Attorney General, Sally Yates, was fired Monday night hours after she refused to defend President Trump's executive order regarding immigration because she is not convinced it is \"lawful,\" according to a letter. In a statement, the White House said Yates \"betrayed the Department of Justice\" and was \"weak on borders\" and said she was being replaced by Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

His executive order imposing a broad travel ban impacting those coming from seven nations tells the world that the United States has a new posture on the world stage. In appearing to make good on the bold action he promised, Trump is signaling a new era to go with the new brand of leadership he brought to the office. And it took only hours after that order was issued for the nation to become engulfed in a defining debate about national security, compassion and what it means to be American. The chaotic aftermath of the president\u2019s move could have consequences for the rest of Trump\u2019s tenure -- and beyond, ABC\u2019s RICK KLEIN writes. http://abcn.ws/2kIwdLG\n\n--TRUMP TWEETS AGAIN ABOUT \u201cFAKE TEARS SCHUMER\u201d: Trump clearly has landed on a new nickname for the Democratic Leader in the Senate, taking to Twitter this morning to lambaste the audio and visual features at Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s rally in front of the Supreme Court last night, ABC\u2019s ALI ROGIN and JORDYN PHELPS write. \u201cNancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!\u201d Trump tweeted. Schumer told ABC\u2019s MARY BRUCE yesterday that he would not \u201cdignify\u201d Trump\u2019s digs, about his crying at a press conference at JFK Airport over the weekend, with a response.\n\n--HAPPENING ON THE HILL: Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly is expected to visit Capitol Hill today to brief the bipartisan leaders of the House and the Senate, as well as the top members on the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees, on the president\u2019s immigration E.O, ABC\u2019s ALI ROGIN and JORDYN PHELPS notes. The Senate will vote on the floor today to confirm Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao (she\u2019s expected to sail through) and the relevant committees will hold their votes to report out the nominations of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, HHS Secretary Tom Price and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Republicans on Capitol Hill will mostly likely face questions today on what they think about Trump canning acting AG Sally Yates over her refusal to enforce the immigration executive order, including when House Speaker Paul Ryan holds a press conference at 10 AM today.\n\nSPEED READ with ABC\u2019s ADAM KELSEY\n\nWHITE HOUSE TELLS DISSENTING DIPLOMATS 'GET WITH THE PROGRAM' OR 'GO.\u2019 White House spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed concerns being raised by career diplomats Monday over President Donald Trump's new executive order restricting immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries, telling them to \"either get with the program, or they can go.\" ABC News first reported Monday morning that dozens of American foreign service officers and other diplomats around the world were preparing to file a formal objection to the executive order.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer doubled down on a White House statement issued Friday on Holocaust Remembrance Day that has sparked backlash from some for not directly mentioning \u201cJews\u201d or \u201canti-Semitism,\u201d reports ABC\u2019s JORDYN PHELPS. \u201cThe statement was written with the help of an individual who is both Jewish and the descendants of Holocaust survivors,\u201d Spicer said Monday. \u201cTo suggest that remembering the Holocaust and acknowledging all of the people, Jewish, gypsies, priests, disabled, gays and lesbians.

An article making the rounds on Facebook falsely says that a bronze statue of former President Barack Obama will soon be in the entryway of the White House. But you won't be seeing it any time soon -- or any time at all. The story is fake. This story, headlined \"WOW: Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statute of Himself To Be Permanently Installed in White House,\" asserts that in the final hours of his presidency, Obama ordered the $200,000 life-sized statue of himself, notes ABC\u2019s RYAN STRUYK. http://abcn.ws/2jMw8bu\n\nPOLICE USE PEPPER SPRAY ON ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTERS IN OHIO.

President Trump\u2019s executive action last week restricting admission to the United States for some immigrants raised a number of questions about the legal status of travelers to the country. Many of the classifications related to travel and immigration status are not interchangeable and define particular rights and allowances under law.

Spicer declined to elaborate further during the daily press briefing.\n\nHere's more on the two front-runners:\n\nGorsuch\n\nGorsuch, 49, is currently a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. He was nominated by President George Bush in 2006 and confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote.\n\nGorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and then for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. He attended Harvard Law and has a Ph.D. from Oxford, where he was a Marshall Scholar. In legal circles, he\u2019s considered a gifted writer. Like Scalia, he's both a textualist and an originalist.\n\nHe is the author of \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\" which looks at the legal and ethical issues surrounding assisted suicides. In the book, he concludes that any form of euthanasia should not be legalized.\n\nIf nominated and confirmed, Gorsuch would be the first Supreme Court justice to serve alongside his former boss -- a justice for whom he/she clerked.\n\nHe would also be the youngest Supreme Court nominee in about 25 years.\n\nHardiman\n\nAs a young man, Hardiman drove a taxi for his family\u2019s business. Hardiman, who grew up in Massachusetts, attended Notre Dame on a scholarship and received his J.D. from Georgetown University. He practiced law in Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. He served as a judge in Philadelphia on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit since 2007.\n\nThat\u2019s the same court where Trump\u2019s sister Maryanne Trump Barry is a senior judge.\n\nHe was nominated to the bench by George W.

We have a leader who has repeatedly to move demeans women who wants to define it organizations that benefit women calling on the media that shot. Specifically wants to give preferential treatment based on religion. I'm these values really much different than the Taliban it's. I mean. While. As you're not trumps values and whatnot but not the bad news that we are. Listening to because one of the things eat you read yesterday was a piece of the the the language a language in the plan in which was about if you disrespect women you just respect gay yes you yes so I just yes I was thinking about it illness same thing plot all of these things that I've been hearing. Are we have arm that used to tell what's hat what's happened now we still supply chain. Plus I think there's a difference between Donald Trump and don't and America because that we I mean I think our values I think of the values outlined in the constitution and whether or not. My president at the time is a reflection of that. Doesn't necessarily mean that that the values of the country or when the people have change I definitely think there's a difference when the Taliban was. He heading people chopping off heads and an American president who may have policies that you disagree with it may be saying things that. But if he says Ray Whitney says I'd I don't like what to do your fired is that I mean that went on newstalk of people had bought it it is what I feel like listen. If you're saying to the media shot. That's what they do. I'm maybe they didn't start out chopping people's hands off maybe they start out differently I I'm asking this because it feels like it's a bit. It's tricky because we're send to people here are our American values. And then we're saying at the same token. Stuff that sounds exactly like the stuff we're fighting and so that's why police say undergoes a trumps bad news I think and my question up an end and and it Mac and content was and then as presented by by looking enabling it to my question then is is. I trumps bad news different from the Republican party's that is does I don't see them objecting to any of this. You do I don't events not a tiny. We are excited would be cited yesterday a whole bunch of Republicans. Against Lindsey Graham John McCain a well listen outlawed that acting is not a lot of water it's not a ayalon president to act as an excellent. I understand that you're saying. They're letting everything go by did it now. I just I don't understand maybe I'm misunderstanding you saying that trumps values are not in line on American values what we'll be presented to believe what she talked about those values about I don't think that trump making comments that are horrific about women is representative of the way the United States market feels about what a lot of people voted for him based on he was going to make America great but now I don't think they are no different outlook again Aaron what I know it for what it not for us and they voted for health insurance plans and they voted for wanting to keep more of their hard earned cash I don't think they voted for what he says he'll have a woman by the genitals stop the president I don't think that weren't there. Yeah. Hits. Sam Jones work on the messy truth that he doesn't really good job I have actually been enlightened to so many of these people I guess I wasn't hearing before. So I definitely don't think they were voting for him because he grabbed him by the lady parts. I think they didn't care apparently they know Garnett adding that you don't what are they heats up so that's another fact that we're sitting here and saying that it's still missing what some what some of the hands work lies which is. There are other things everybody has different things whether you can treat women right or put food on the table for your family some of these people feet. That their vote is going to help them provide food either Iowa you know so I am scanning over simple. I let you know want to attract voters said and this was famous when a wall around. We didn't taken literally we took him seriously well now you can take it literally because every single thing he said has literally come tore up. OK a fat cat isn't. He meant everything he's and it disagree with the policy and that's OK but there are a lot of people in the country that look at what he's doing and are applauding it and are saying. We like this executive order we'd like it under that heading rings they actually that isn't what Janet Reno. Leaned back to that question so the question this when you put some of these things side by side. How useful what kind of religion your response to have missed buzz at one religion. OK so people don't see it that now that I accept all right why not when I American business when he says that there's a preferential treatment for Christians. For getting all the other were. Religions out the act you need for the refugee programs I got. I'm talking and expect any time now is that there's a reason for that because in that country in Syria Christians are the minority know what he's not just an area he's not generally Manning's and you know here's the thing we have a constitution. That says these are things we don't do this is what makes us different from everybody else our media nobody tells army he just shut up. And just hey that's out now. That's how. That's how they did anti American value now but my question is. Did that and what kind of Derrick Rose who's who's the no puppet what do you what is happening. Who knows what's happening what do you think. In new ways we're seeing in the protests and the people that are coming out and marching the president Obama's were speaking up it's showing that there is a value system. That remains in is alive and well so even if it's not presently meet each team. Reflected in some in the Los coming down. We're loudly there's a lot of postal. The president of the United States of America physical timid black. Every American values that so many of us have when you're talking about America this used to be the bastion of peace does used to be the place where you could go when you retired you where we can you were persecuted.

The action stranded travelers around the world, led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Yates, like other senior government officials, was caught by surprise by the executive order and agonized over the weekend about how to respond, two Justice Department officials involved in the weekend deliberations said. Ms. Yates considered resigning but she told colleagues she did not want to leave it to her successor to face the same dilemma.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, Ms. Yates added to a deepening sense of anxiety in the nation\u2019s capital by publicly confronting the president with a stinging challenge to his authority, laying bare a deep divide at the Justice Department, within the diplomatic corps and elsewhere in the government over the wisdom of his order.\n\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,\u201d Ms. Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s senior aides huddled together in the West Wing to determine what to do.\n\nThey decided quickly that her insubordination could not stand, according to an administration official familiar with the deliberations. Among the chief concerns was whether Mr. Sessions could be confirmed quickly by the Senate.\n\nAfter Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, received reassurances from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, that the confirmation was on track, aides took their recommendation to Mr. Trump in the White House residence.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

He accused Democrats of holding up the confirmation of Mr. Sessions for political reasons. \u201cCalling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\u201d\n\nFormer Justice Department officials said the president\u2019s action would send a deep shudder through an agency that was already on edge as officials anticipated an ideological overhaul once Mr. Session takes over. One former senior official said that department lawyers would be unnerved by the firing.\n\nVideo\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, hailed Ms. Yates as a principled defender of what she thought was right. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that the \u201cattorney general should be loyal and pledge fidelity to the law, not the White House. The fact that this administration doesn\u2019t understand that is chilling.\u201d\n\nMr. Boente has told the White House that he is willing to sign off on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees and immigration, according to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, Va., where Mr. Boente has served as the top prosecutor since 2015.\n\nMr. Boente, who has been a prosecutor with the Justice Department for 31 years, had no hesitation about accepting the acting attorney general\u2019s job given his \u201cseniority and loyalty\u201d to the department, Mr. Stueve said in a telephone interview on Monday night.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Ms. Yates was the only person at the Justice Department authorized to sign applications for foreign surveillance warrants. Administrations of both parties have interpreted surveillance laws as requiring foreign surveillance warrants be signed only by Senate-confirmed Justice Department officials. Mr. Boente was Senate-confirmed as United States attorney and, though the situation is unprecedented, the White House said he was authorized to sign the warrants.\n\nMs. Yates\u2019s decision had effectively overruled a finding by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which had already approved the executive order \u201cwith respect to form and legality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Yates said her determination in deciding not to defend the order was broader, however, and included questions not only about the order\u2019s lawfulness, but also whether it was a \u201cwise or just\u201d policy. She also alluded to unspecified statements the White House had made before signing the order, which she factored into her review.\n\nMr. Trump initially responded to the letter with a post on Twitter at 7:45 p.m., complaining that the Senate\u2019s delay in confirming his cabinet nominees had resulted in leaving Ms. Yates in place.\n\nThe 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d led to a constitutional crisis that ended when Robert H.

It is set to unfold in prime time, an attention-grabbing way for the president \u2014 consumed in recent days with questions about his hard-line order cracking down on immigration and refugees \u2014 to frame what conservatives and liberals see as a battle for the future of the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nAt least some Democrats, embittered by Republicans\u2019 refusal to even consider former President Barack Obama\u2019s choice to fill a vacancy created by the sudden death last February of Justice Antonin Scalia, have signaled they are likely to oppose whomever Mr. Trump selects.\n\nThe leading finalists were believed to be two federal appeals court judges with strong conservative records: Neil M.

Justice Scalia\u2019s status has made the choice of his successor a particularly symbolic one among conservatives, and it helped fuel the refusal of Republicans for nearly a year to consider Mr. Obama\u2019s choice of Merrick B. Garland.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s desire is to nudge the court the opposite way.\n\nSeveral officials said the White House is expected to use the appointment in part to send a message to Justice Anthony Kennedy, 80, who holds a swing vote in many Supreme Court cases and has been considering retirement.

One usually plugged-in Republican consultant who didn\u2019t want to be identified picking a fight with the new president said a continuation of the turmoil would quickly call into question the basic competency of the new administration. He noted that despite being in the middle of past Supreme Court confirmation fights, he surprisingly had not heard from the White House for ideas on how to handle the coming one.\n\nSenator Angus King, an independent from Maine who is part of the Senate Democratic Caucus, called the executive order on immigration a \u201cdisaster\u201d and pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s reliance on an extremely tight circle of advisers.\n\n\u201cThis president, you know, he listens to a very narrow group of people, and as we\u2019ve learned this weekend, can make some very bad decisions,\u201d Mr. King said in an interview on CNN. \u201cWe need to get some people around him as quickly as possible who can rein in those impulses like what we saw this weekend.\u201d\n\nAt least part of the mounting consternation in the capital was because of the clear break with ingrained rituals and ways of doing business.\n\nWhen Democrats were clashing with President George W.

Judge Hardiman has been recommended by Mr. Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, who is a federal judge. But Judge Gorsuch has strong supporters.\n\nThe Trump administration is also mindful of making a choice that would be seen as moderate enough that Justice Anthony Kennedy, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, could feel comfortable with retiring in the next few years, opening up another seat for the current president to fill.\n\nJudge Gorsuch was a clerk for Mr. Kennedy.\n\nTrump wants a big show for his Supreme Court rollout. Networks oblige\n\nThe major broadcast networks are set to carry President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court announcement live on Tuesday evening, cutting into regular prime-time programming.\n\nThe coverage by ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox broadcast affiliates is likely to significantly expand the television audience for the president\u2019s announcement, which has taken on the air of a reality television special. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter account to encourage Americans to tune in for the event.\n\nTypically, the introduction of a Supreme Court nominee occurs during the daytime, when viewership is relatively lower. The major cable-news networks also plan to carry tonight\u2019s announcement live.\n\nTrump greets drug makers with a carrot and a stick\n\nPresident Trump, who just weeks ago accused the pharmaceutical industry of \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d demanded on Tuesday that major drug companies lower their prices and return operations to the United States. But he vowed to help them by shredding regulations and leveling the playing field with foreign countries.\n\nMr. Trump gathered the heads of pharmaceutical companies in the Roosevelt Room for what has become a regular feature of his first days in the White House: a meeting with corporate leaders, at which the president holds forth on an pet issue for the television cameras.\n\nOn drug pricing, the president has aligned himself with Democrats, who have long argued that the government should be allowed to bargain for lower drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid, a position fought tooth and nail by Republicans. But Mr. Trump was diplomatic, at least for the cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be streamlining the process, so that, from your standpoint, when you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years,\u201d he added.\n\nMuch of his message had to do with luring corporate investment back to the United States. He promised that the Food and Drug Administration would speed its approval of new drugs. And he said the United States would end \u201cforeign freeloading,\u201d which he described as countries devaluing their currencies to undercut the competitiveness of the American market.\n\n\u201cBecause our country has been run so badly, we know nothing about devaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at what China\u2019s doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market, while we sit here like a bunch of dummies.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s currency has actually been appreciating of late, and Japan has not intentionally manipulated its currency values for several years.\n\nAmid executive branch chaos, Trump calls Democrats \u2018a mess\u2019\n\nThe acting attorney general has been fired, protests are rocking the nation\u2019s largest airports, and a constitutional clash is brewing between the executive and judicial branches, but Mr. Trump thinks the Democrats are a real mess because their audio equipment malfunctions, as do their tear ducts.\n\nThe rally he was referring to was surprisingly large for what amounted to a political event on the steps of the Supreme Court. But what is really sticking in the president\u2019s craw is the glacial pace of confirmations in the Senate \u2014 which is intentional. His choice for transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, is likely to be confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, and his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, will probably get a vote on Wednesday. Committee votes are expected today for his nominees for attorney general, Jeff Sessions and small business administrator, Linda McMahon. The Senate Education Committee voted out the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary on a party-line vote.\n\nBut Democrats are deliberately slowing the process as they demand more answers to questions about ethics and the nominees\u2019 views on Mr. Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban from citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweets only gave Democratic leaders the opportunity to grab the high ground. Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, responded:\n\n\u201cThe mic briefly didn\u2019t work, but this thin-skinned President clearly heard the voices of the more than 250 Members of Congress and thousands of others who gathered outside the Supreme Court last night. The President\u2019s immoral executive order is clearly unconstitutional \u2013 no matter how many times he tweets or how many Administration officials he fires.\u201d\n\nSo did Mr. Schumer\u2019s spokesman, Matt House:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump should learn that name calling is not going to solve the many problems this administration has already brought upon itself. He ought to repeal this un-American, poorly put-together, and rushed executive order that makes America less safe and figure out a real way to stop terrorism.\u201d\n\nDemocrats boycott committee vote to slow Trump nominees\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Finance Committee sought to stall the confirmations of Steven Mnuchin and Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for Treasury secretary and secretary of health and human Services, refusing to attend scheduled votes on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said that recent news reports suggested that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings and that the committee members needed more information before making judgments about the nominees.\n\n\u201cWe have made clear that we need additional information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said outside of his office, explaining the reason for the boycott.\n\nRepublicans expressed dismay at the delay. But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its 12-month point after an unprecedented blockade by Republicans, Democrats weren\u2019t exactly feeling the heat, at least not yet.\n\nShowdown at Justice Dept. raises heat on Senate\n\nThe late-night firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, over her refusal to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning refugees, immigrants and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has put a lot of people in a sticky position: senators.\n\nDemocrats now have every reason to drag out the confirmation fight over Mr. Sessions as long as possible, leaving Mr. Trump\u2019s order defended by a Justice Department rived by dissent against a growing list of opponents.\n\nMr. Trump seems to understand this.\n\nBut what about Republican senators like John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Cory Gardner of Colorado?\n\nThey have leverage to demand changes before they seat Mr. Sessions at the Justice Department. But as the fight drags on, so does the lag in warrants. The pressure will only intensify.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt her confirmation hearings to be deputy attorney general, Ms. Yates faced a grilling from Republicans who were furious about former President Barack Obama\u2019s order liberalizing immigration policy.\n\nThe question: Would Ms. Yates be willing to stand up to the president?\n\nHer inquisitor? Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, and now Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general.\n\n\u201cIf the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say \u2018No?\u2019\u201d Mr. Sessions asked.\n\n\u201cI believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,\u201d Ms. Yates replied.\n\nEuropean Union official sees Trump as a threat\n\nThe European Union negotiator on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union returned from the United States and declared that a united Europe now faces three threats: Islamist terrorism, President Vladimir V.

The best they can do, in some cases, is to try to pin him down on basic facts or nudge him in the right direction, as two European leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, both did in recent days.\n\nIn a phone call with Mr. Trump on Saturday, Ms. Merkel objected to the president\u2019s temporary ban on the entry of Muslims from seven countries. To make her case, the chancellor\u2019s spokesman said, Ms. Merkel found herself explaining to him the Geneva Conventions, which oblige countries to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds.\n\nFor Mrs. May, who visited the White House on Friday, the goal was to clarify Mr. Trump\u2019s position on NATO. During the presidential campaign, he derided the alliance as obsolete and questioned whether the United States would automatically come to the defense of its members. More recently, he has said the United States will support it \u2014 a pledge the prime minister claimed to have extracted from him in their closed-door meeting.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMr. President, I think you said, you confirmed that you\u2019re 100 percent behind NATO,\u201d Mrs. May said at a joint news conference, looking at Mr. Trump, who did not mention the alliance in his remarks.\n\nDiplomats draw a distinction between Mr. Trump\u2019s plainly false assertions about crowd sizes or that millions of people voted illegally in the election and his hints about lifting sanctions on Russia or promises to rip up the Iran nuclear deal. The latter two fall into a more standard category of positions taken by a political candidate that may later change.\n\nMr. Westmacott said those were not what he would call \u201cbarefaced lies.\u201d \u201cThey are early statements of policy,\u201d he said, \u201cperhaps not well thought through, which European capitals \u2014 and others which might draw the wrong conclusions \u2014 need to see clarified.\u201d Mrs. May\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump, he said, was a useful first step in that process.\n\nThe trouble is, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to bend the truth could make it difficult to judge when the United States has settled on firm policies on these issues.\n\nMuch of that may hinge on the influence wielded by a cadre of senior cabinet officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State-designate Rex W. Tillerson, who hold views that differ from their boss\u2019s and are regarded as steadier hands than him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor France and Germany, the White House\u2019s embrace of what a senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, called \u201calternative facts\u201d carries another chilling political dimension. Both countries are holding elections this year in which far-right populist parties are mounting a vigorous challenge to the political establishment.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides view his election victory as part of a populist wave that swept through Britain, with its vote to leave the European Union, and will now deluge the Continent.\n\nBreitbart News, a far-right website until recently run by Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is setting up outposts in Paris and Berlin, which French and German officials worry will propagate \u201cfake news\u201d to try to swing the elections. Germany has already been targeted by fake news operations, which officials believe emanate mostly from Russia.\n\nGerman officials said Ms. Merkel was studiously pursuing a businesslike relationship with the president as part of their shared call on Saturday. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want any differences to obscure the key relationship we have with the United States,\u201d said Peter Wittig, the German ambassador to Washington.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Some diplomats said the president\u2019s false statements blurred the line between the United States and authoritarian states.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s enemies feared it for dealing in facts while they offered disinformation and conspiracy theories,\u201d said Husain Haqqani, Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to Washington. \u201cAll that changes when the White House embraces the notion of \u2018alternative facts.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cConspiracy theories and disinformation put out by America\u2019s detractors gain greater currency once the distinction between fact and false claim is eroded at the American end,\u201d Mr. Haqqani said.\n\nPresidents, to be sure, have long dissembled on matters of national security. Lyndon B. Johnson was known for his \u201ccredibility gap,\u201d the historian Robert Dallek pointed out, while Richard M. Nixon once ordered a devastating South Vietnamese military defeat in Cambodia to be presented to the public as a victory.

On multiple foreign policy fronts, he has done what he said he would do in the campaign. He closed the borders to the seven Muslim-majority countries. He pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, dealing a coup de gr\u00e2ce to a 12-nation trade agreement. And he signed an executive order to build a wall on the nation\u2019s southern border, demanding again that Mexico pay for it.\n\nMexican officials, however, said they felt betrayed by Mr. Trump because he posted his latest demand on Twitter on the same day that a high-level delegation sent by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto arrived in Washington to meet with White House staff members to smooth over concerns about border security. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto angrily canceled a trip to Washington.\n\n\u201cAny world leader\u2019s first audience is their home audience,\u201d said Jorge Guajardo, who was Mexico\u2019s ambassador to China. \u201cThe possibility of being humiliated by the president in your home country is untenable.\u201d\n\nFor some foreign policy experts, Mr. Trump\u2019s falsehoods are not themselves a cause for panic.

Mr. Trump lacks an end game.\n\nSecurity experts in the United States are baffled by Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order abruptly barring entry by citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries, noting that it will ultimately put the security of the United States at risk by sending a uniform message of hostility to 1.6 billion followers of Islam.\n\nIn Mexico, government officials are scratching their heads about what Mr. Trump hopes to achieve by threatening to walk away from the trade agreement that has cemented bilateral relations for the last quarter-century. And who knows what Mr. Trump thinks the United States would stand to gain by leaving the World Trade Organization?\n\n\u201cWhat is a better Nafta?\u201d asked Douglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said.\u201d\n\nThe posturing is not entirely surprising. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to wall off the United States from a variety of foreign influences fit the promises he made to his base of working-class white voters, resentful of how trade and immigration have changed the country they claim as their own.\n\nBut Mr. Trump seems not to have grasped how consequential his proposals are. He is offering to kick down the set of understandings that shaped the cooperative equilibrium among the Western market democracies for more than half a century \u2014 a network of military alliances and trade agreements that underpinned the global order after the end of World War II.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he shows no evidence of knowing what kind of alternative order he would like to build in their place. He is proposing a series of self-inflicted wounds with no ulterior goal in mind.\n\nWhy did the United States enter into Nafta? In part because it believed it stood to gain from trade but also because it thought Mexico would gain, too, and understood the benefit of helping its southern neighbor into the club of prosperous market democracies. Why did it allow China into the World Trade Organization? Perhaps because it benefited from binding what would inevitably become the world\u2019s largest economy with a set of American-designed trade rules.\n\nCordell Hull, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s long-serving secretary of state and a key architect of postwar foreign strategy, once wrote, \u201cif we could increase commercial exchanges among nations over lowered trade and tariff barriers and remove unnatural obstructions to trade, we would go a long way toward eliminating war itself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has little patience for this thinking. The president understands international relations as zero-sum competitions. To win at trade, one must export, he believes. Importers lose. Mutually beneficial, win-win solutions are a figment of some diplomat\u2019s imagination. The idea that the Trans-Pacific Partnership might serve American interests by cementing critical alliances with China\u2019s neighbors in Asia is nonsense.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Trade agreements just determine the rules for trade.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, the possibility that Mr. Trump is a strategic genius, out to gain an edge over the nation\u2019s rivals by convincing them he is prepared to engage in irrational, self-defeating behavior. \u201cIn foreign affairs, it makes sense to be insane,\u201d noted David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon also tried this, in the 1970s. The idea has intellectual pedigree, developed by the strategic thinker Thomas Schelling, who played a critical role in developing the strategy of nuclear deterrence based on mutually assured destruction.\n\nAnd yet it is difficult to see the genius in Mr. Trump\u2019s first days in office. For starters, the crazy-person strategy works only in pursuit of some rational objective. What\u2019s his? Mr. Trump has yet to articulate one. Having a zero trade deficit is not it.\n\nThen there is the fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s macroeconomic strategy, which looks set to marry increased government spending with high interest rates, is in some tension with his objectives on trade: By strengthening the value of the dollar, it will make the trade deficit bigger.\n\nFinally, the problems that the president has resolved to tackle have largely petered out on their own. More Mexican immigrants are leaving the United States than coming in. And Chinese exports to the United States are actually declining.\n\nSupporters might think there is little harm to Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy realignment, even if it doesn\u2019t achieve lasting benefits. They might want to ponder a point that the Nobel laureate Robert M. Solow made: If somebody sat down next to you at a party and said he was Napoleon, would you engage in a discussion with him about cavalry tactics?\n\nIn other words, why get drawn into the minutiae of a technical discussion when the overall framework of the conversation is ludicrous? He was thinking of propositions by his fellow economists Robert E. Lucas Jr. and Thomas J. Sargent. Other countries, however, might apply it to the propositions of President Trump.\n\nLast week, after Mr. Trump openly proclaimed that Mexico would pay for a border wall, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to the United States. Other officials in Mexico have been working to build an argument that Mexico could hurt the United States, too, to deter American aggression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat if every other country goes down this path?

About one-third of the aircraft, some as small as model airplanes, dropped bombs or were rigged with explosives to detonate on the ground, said Col. John L. Dorrian, the spokesman for the American-led operation against the Islamic State in Baghdad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIraqi officials said bombs dropped by the drones, which were primarily quadcopters, had killed about a dozen government soldiers and injured more than 50. \u201cIt poses a threat to troops on the ground, and it has value as a propaganda technique,\u201d Colonel Dorrian said of the Islamic State drone program in an email. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s certainly not a game-changer when it comes to the outcome of the battle to liberate Mosul.\u201d\n\nA new video message from the Islamic State, \u201cKnights of the Departments,\u201d appeared to depict these new drone missions.\n\nThe documents were discovered by Vera Mironova, an international security fellow at the Belfer Center at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Ms. Mironova obtained the documents while she was conducting research in Iraq on the individual behavior of Islamic State fighters. She said in an interview via Skype that she had come across the materials in a drone workshop formerly under the control of the Islamic State in the Muhandeseen neighborhood of Mosul, near Mosul University.\n\nIraqi soldiers were not interested in the documents, Ms. Mironova said. But recognizing their potential value to the American military, she contacted the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, which has previously published her work.\n\nTwo researchers at the center, Don Rassler and Muhammad al-Ubaydi, reviewed the roughly 30 pages she sent. Confirming the authenticity of documents from a war zone is always tricky. But in a nine-page assessment, an advance copy of which was provided to The New York Times along with the documents themselves, the authors concluded the materials were genuine based on where and how Ms. Mironova obtained them and the center\u2019s experience working with an array of captured battlefield material.\n\nAll of the documents appear to be from around 2015 \u2014 the early phases of the drone program \u2014 and the collection includes a mix of official Islamic State forms and handwritten notes, according to the researchers\u2019 analysis.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

According to the assessment of the documents, the Islamic State\u2019s drone unit falls under the Al Bara\u2019 bin Malik Brigade, a part of the aviation sector of the Islamic State\u2019s Committee for Military Manufacturing and Development.\n\nThe standardized four-page checklist for drone operations provided another example. On the first page, drone operators were asked to provide details about their mission \u2014 specifically, the type of mission (there are six options, including \u201cBombing\u201d and \u201cExplosive Plane\u201d), the militants who were involved, the location and the way point coordinates for the flight.\n\nThe second page of the form consisted of a checklist that seems to have been designed to help the drone operators conduct pre- or post-mission checks of their systems and equipment (including \u201cBomb Ignition sys\u201d and \u201cBomb igniter RC\u201d), the assessment said. The third page was a checklist of gear in the operator\u2019s \u201ctool case,\u201d including \u201cscrewdriver,\u201d \u201cpliers\u201d and \u201cknife.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last page of the form asked the operators to note whether their mission had succeeded or failed. It also provided space for the operators to write notes, perhaps to document lessons learned from failed missions or interesting events that occurred during successful ones, the assessment said.\n\nThe documents also contained detailed acquisition records, essentially shopping lists for the off-the-shelf commercial technology that the Islamic State is buying.\n\nThe lists showed the group\u2019s efforts to buy items like a GoPro camera, memory cards, GPS units, digital video recorders and extra propeller blades, the assessment said. The purchasing lists also highlighted the group\u2019s efforts to enhance the range and performance of its drones, whether bought commercially or not. For example, to protect the transmission of their drone video feeds, members of the group wanted to acquire encrypted video transmitters and receivers, the assessment said.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a list of material necessary to the construction of those drones,\u201d said Damien Spleeters, head of operations in Iraq for Conflict Armament Research, a private arms consultancy that has been investigating weapons recovered from the Islamic State since 2014. Mr. Spleeters has also reviewed the documents for the West Point center. \u201cSo it shows consistency and standardization, certainly with some sort of chain of supply in place,\u201d he said.\n\nAmerican military officials said that the Pentagon had dedicated significant resources to stopping Islamic State drones but that few Iraqi and Kurdish units had been provided with the sophisticated devices that the American troops had to disarm them. The officials said they had ordered the Pentagon agency in charge of dealing with explosive devices \u2014 known as the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization \u2014 to study ways to thwart hostile drones. Last summer, the Pentagon requested an additional $20 million from Congress to help address the problem.\n\nThe recovered documents offer few clues about how the militants view the future of their drones.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we should expect the Islamic State to refine its drone bomb-drop capability,\u201d the assessment concluded. \u201cIt is likely that the Islamic State\u2019s use of this tactic will not only become more frequent, but more lethal as well.\u201d", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/01/world/01Drones/01Drones-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 10:00:02 GMT", "summary": "Documents found in Iraq and a recent surge in attacks show how the group has adapted readily accessible technology into a potentially effective new weapon.", "source": "New York Times", "authors": ["ERIC SCHMITT"], "keywords": ["peek", "documents", "isis", "largely", "offer", "operators", "offtheshelf", "drones", "islamic", "state", "drone", "video", "papers", "lethal", "provided", "assessment", "page"], "tags": ["Drones (Pilotless Planes)", "Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)", "Terrorism", "Iraq", "Bombs and Explosives", "United States Defense and Military Forces", "Mosul (Iraq)"]}, {"title": "A Tale in Blue and Red: Are You Married to Your Party?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/upshot/are-you-married-to-your-party.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text": "Photo\n\nPeople often ask me \u201cwho these people are\u201d \u2014 those who elected Donald J. Trump or those who voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThey\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the single best description of Trump supporters?\u201d My answer often disappoints them. It\u2019s quite simple: They\u2019re Republicans. When they ask about Clinton supporters, the answer is similar: They\u2019re Democrats.\n\nIt seems like a frustrating answer, but for more than six decades, party identification has been shaping the vote. Political scientists have long held that party labels do more than just summarize people\u2019s views on issues and policies. They are expressions of an identity. This trait, like many others, may be learned in the laps of our parents and in our neighborhoods when we are young, the same way we learn about our ethnicities or religions.\n\nAnd it seems we also want to perpetuate that identity in successive generations. A survey of whom American voters prefer for their children\u2019s marriage partners shows just how powerful party identification has become.\n\nTo track the power of party identification on voting, every four years since 1952, the American National Election Study has asked a random sample of Americans which party they identified with and whom they voted for in the most recent presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1952 and 1956, nearly all self-proclaimed Republicans (96 percent) voted for Dwight Eisenhower, while nearly three-quarters of Democrats voted for Adlai Stevenson. Party voting remained the norm for Richard Nixon in 1960, 1968 and 1972, with more than 9 of 10 Republicans choosing him over the Democrat. The Democrats came close to this level of party loyalty in 1964 when Lyndon Johnson faced Barry Goldwater.\n\nSome candidates do worse than others. Senator Goldwater didn\u2019t hold his party together as well (only 73 percent of Republicans were loyal to him in 1964), nor did Hubert Humphrey (77 percent), George McGovern (59 percent) or Jimmy Carter (74 percent in 1980). But by the late 1980s, nearly everyone who identified with a party or even leaned slightly toward a party voted for that party\u2019s candidate in the presidential election.\n\nThere have been very few deviations from this pattern over the last two decades. Roughly 90 percent of partisans voted for the candidate from their party in every year since 2000.\n\nFor all of its unexpected moments, 2016 looks an awful lot like all the other years: There was no meaningful shift in the pattern of intraparty voting.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There\u2019s some evidence that both of these things are true, but another way to see the power of partisanship as a social identity is to look at something completely different: marriage.\n\nIn 1958, the Gallup Organization asked a random sample of Americans a question about what kind of man people wanted their daughters to marry \u2014 a Democrat or a Republican. The question read: If you had a daughter of marriageable age, would you prefer she marry a Democrat or a Republican, all other things being equal?\n\nIn the late 1950s, 18 percent of respondents said they would want their daughter to marry a Democrat, 10 percent a Republican, and the remainder, 72 percent, either didn\u2019t answer or said they didn\u2019t care.\n\nI asked a representative sample of people a version of this question (that included \u201cson or daughter\u201d) in the week before the 2016 election and found changes that mimic the changes in the intensity of intraparty voting over these same years. In 2016, more people care about the party of their future in-law than cared in 1958, and there is more desire for same-party marriage than there was in the 1950s.\n\nIn 2016, 28 percent of respondents said they wanted their son or daughter to marry a Democrat and 27 percent a Republican, leaving only 45 percent to say they didn\u2019t care.\n\nPeople who identified with a party had even more intense feelings. In 1958, 33 percent of Democrats wanted their daughters to marry a Democrat, and 25 percent of Republicans wanted their daughters to marry a Republican. But by 2016, 60 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Republicans felt that way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople in each party now share more similar views on issues and they are more alike in race and ethnicity.

Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state.\n\nThe legislation to repeal the rule, introduced by Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan and advanced to the House floor by the rules committee on Monday, has a good shot of becoming law thanks to an obscure parliamentary procedure. Under the Congressional Review Act, passed in 1996, Congress has a limited window to undo newly finalized regulations using only 51 Senate votes, rather than the normal 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers, all but guaranteeing them success.\n\nThis effort is just the beginning. House Republicans are also moving bolder legislation that would repeal crucial provisions of Dodd-Frank, including the so-called Volcker rule, which prevents banks from making risky bets with their own money. And they are exploring ways to use the budget process to potentially defund some of the law\u2019s most contentious provisions.\n\nStill, each strategy has its limits. The House legislation to repeal Dodd-Frank could stall in the Senate, where it needs 60 votes. And even though the Congressional Review Act requires only a majority of lawmakers to repeal a rule, only 10 or so Dodd-Frank rules are vulnerable to this process.\n\n\u201cIt is the height of hypocrisy for Republicans to now be wasting time attacking rules signed by the former president, which went through a rigorous vetting process,\u201d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the top Democrat on the rules committee.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven the president\u2019s latest executive order could have a minor impact.\n\nThe order says each new rule must be offset by regulatory cuts that save at least twice as much money. It also instructs the Office of Management and Budget to set annual limits on the total cost of rules issued by each department. For the current year, the limit is set at zero.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis will be the largest cut ever, by far, in terms of regulation,\u201d Mr. Trump said hyperbolically.\n\nBut the order does not apply to independent agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, limiting its effect on financial regulation. Independent agencies could choose to comply but are unlikely to do so while under the leadership of people appointed by President Obama.\n\nIn addition, the order includes a broad exemption for \u201cemergencies and other circumstances.\u201d\n\nDespite the obstacles, there are a number of different tactics that Republicans can use to try to dismantle Dodd-Frank.\n\nCongressional Review Act\n\nDodd-Frank opponents owe Newt Gingrich a debt of gratitude.\n\nThe Congressional Review Act, passed some 20 years ago as part of his Contract With America, provides lawmakers at least 60 days to introduce legislation disapproving major new regulations. The lawmakers can ultimately repeal the regulations with support from just a majority of lawmakers and the president. The Congressional Research Service has determined that rules sent to Congress on or after June 13 of last year are vulnerable to repeal.\n\nUntil now, the Congressional Review Act was not much of a weapon. It has led to a repeal measure being signed into law only once, in 2001, when Republicans and President George W. Bush wiped out workplace safety regulations adopted near the end of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\nBut Republicans have identified dozens of potential rules to override, some of which arose from Dodd-Frank, according to congressional documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nRepublicans can target a derivatives rule adopted last year by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule for prepaid debit cards and a rule approved by banking regulators that imposed capital requirements for banks that trade derivatives. The threat also applies to any unfinished rules that the consumer bureau completes, including its looming crackdown on payday lending.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The House rules committee advanced the legislation to repeal that rule on Monday over the objections of the panel\u2019s Democrats, who argued that Republicans were misusing the Congressional Review Act to undermine Dodd-Frank.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe oil-disclosure policy has already had a tortured history. The S.E.C. completed the rule in 2012, with the support of antipoverty groups like Oxfam and the One Campaign, but the American Petroleum Institute, the trade group representing Exxon Mobil and other oil companies, sued the agency and won.\n\nIn 2013, a federal judge in the District of Columbia vacated the rule. It took the S.E.C. another three years to redo the rule, which it finally did in June of last year, opening it to Republican attack under the Congressional Review Act.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is responding to a narrow interest within the industry that is trying to be secretive,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who sponsored the amendment in Dodd-Frank along with former Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican.\n\nReplacing Dodd-Frank\n\nIf the Congressional Review Act is a scalpel, then the Financial Choice Act is a sledgehammer.\n\nThe legislation, introduced last summer by Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, represents the most comprehensive response to Dodd-Frank yet.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe bill would repeal the Volcker rule as well as the so-called Durbin amendment, which set a limit on fees retailers are charged for debit card transactions. It would replace Dodd-Frank with a more flexible regulatory structure.\n\nAfter a false start under President Obama, Mr. Hensarling\u2019s plan to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank could gain new life from Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cRepublicans on the Financial Services Committee are eager to work with the president and his administration to unclog the arteries of our financial system so the lifeblood of capital can flow more freely and create jobs,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said in a statement.\n\nHe hopes to pass the bill this year \u2014 with his committee expected to take it up in the coming weeks \u2014 but that is no sure thing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor one thing, the deep-pocketed banking lobby is not unanimous in its support of Mr. Hensarling, a Texan with a populist streak whose plan is arguably more geared toward small banks than big ones. Many of the biggest banks, creatures of habit that have already adjusted to much of Dodd-Frank, would prefer specific accommodations, rather than wholesale repeal of the law.\n\nMr. Hensarling\u2019s plan would also need to merge with legislation offered by Senate Republicans. And even then, they would need some Democrats to reach 60 votes.\n\nHouse Democrats have vowed to fight Mr. Hensarling.\n\n\u201cThis bill is so bad that it simply cannot be fixed,\u201d Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on Mr. Hensarling\u2019s committee, said of his bill last year.\n\nThe Budget\n\nIf his straightforward legislation stalls, Mr. Hensarling may find comfort in the minutiae of the budget reconciliation process.\n\nIn the next six weeks or so, his committee is required to submit its \u201cbudget views\u201d for 2018 to the House Budget Committee. In this document, Mr. Hensarling is expected to recommend a number of measures that could rein in some core aspects of Dodd-Frank.\n\nFor example, he will most likely recommend replacing regulators\u2019 authority to wind down troubled banks with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code. He also could tinker with the funding for two bodies that Republicans love to hate: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a collective of regulators who monitor threats to the financial system.\n\nBy subjecting these bodies to the congressional appropriations process, rather than a dedicated funding mechanism, Congress may be able to cut their funding.\n\nIt is unclear whether this plan will gain traction with congressional leaders.\n\nRegulatory Apathy\n\nWhile Congress is busy fighting Dodd-Frank, the Trump administration\u2019s financial regulators may prove that less is more.\n\nWall Street is hoping that with new leaders at the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulators may allow some leeway for violations of the Volcker rule and other regulations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd while most of Dodd-Frank has been completed, there are rules left to set, including restrictions on executive compensation.

She led prosecutions against some of the city\u2019s most high-profile defendants, including Bill Campbell, a former Democratic mayor who was accused of racketeering and tax fraud, and Eric Robert Rudolph, who set bombs at a park during the 1996 Olympic Games, a gay nightclub and two Southern abortion clinics.\n\nShe also took on the leaders of an Atlanta suburb who refused to allow construction of a mosque. The Justice Department sued and the city reversed itself.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom requires that local government decisions impacting the exercise of that freedom be free of discrimination,\u201d Ms. Yates said at the time.\n\nIn Washington, Ms. Yates\u2019s outgoing personality made her a counterpoint to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who is more reserved. At times, that made Ms. Yates the face of the Justice Department in ways that caused tension with the attorney general\u2019s staff. Ms. Yates was regarded as professionally ambitious, though she has told friends that she has no interest in running for political office.\n\nHer firing capped three days of internal deliberations at the Justice Department. Like many others in the government, Ms. Yates, was caught by surprise Friday night by Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily stopping all refugees from entering the country and indefinitely blocking immigration or visits from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department had reviewed the order and signed off on its legality.

She later added, \u201cThe intent was clear from the face of it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump had campaigned on a promise to single out Muslims for immigration restrictions. One of his advisers, Rudolph W.

Mr. Sessions, an immigration hard-liner, argued that the Justice Department should have refused to support Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action liberalizing immigration policy.\n\nMs. Yates promised that she would stand up to the president, if necessary.\n\nLast year, Ms. Yates and Ms. Lynch earned the ire of Democrats \u2014 including many in the department \u2014 for not intervening and prohibiting the F.B.I. director, James B.

The letter raised the prospect of new and potentially damaging evidence against Hillary Clinton related to an investigation that had been closed. Nothing came of the new evidence, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team says the letter cost her the presidency.

Social workers, not doctors, perform assessments, and low-paid technicians with little training apply the methods to patients, including children with complex problems.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn interviews, nearly a dozen child psychiatrists and psychologists with expertise in autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., expressed caution regarding some of Neurocore\u2019s assertions, advertising and methods.\n\n\u201cThis causes real harm to children because it diverts attention, hope and resources,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Siegel, a child psychiatrist at Maine Behavioral Healthcare and associate professor at Tufts School of Medicine, who co-wrote autism practice standards for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. \u201cIf there were something out there that was uniquely powerful and wonderful, we\u2019d all be using it.\u201d\n\nNeurocore rejects any suggestion that its treatments do not work as advertised. Dr. Majid Fotuhi, Neurocore chief medical officer, said, \u201cThere is significant research to support the efficacy of neurofeedback for a variety of mental and behavioral health issues.\u201d\n\nMs. DeVos, whose appointment as education secretary is expected to be voted on Tuesday morning by a Senate committee, had said she would leave Neurocore\u2019s board, but would retain her investment in the company, which she valued at $5 million to $25 million, according to documents filed this month with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nLast Friday, a group of Democratic senators sent Ms. DeVos a letter saying that her financial disclosure raised questions about potential conflicts. The senators were skeptical of the DeVos family trusts, and also raised questions about Neurocore, which called itself educational in a trademark dispute. The lawmakers asked Ms. DeVos if she would commit that she and her family members would not \u201cbenefit financially from actions\u201d she could take in her new role.\n\nAt Neurocore\u2019s clinics, children and adults with A.D.H.D., anxiety, depression, autism and other psychological and neurological diagnoses sit before monitors watching movies or television shows ranging from \u201cFrozen\u201d to \u201cMad Men,\u201d with sensors attached to their scalps and earlobes.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhenever they become distracted or anxious, the video automatically freezes. That feedback, known as conditioning, leads the vast majority of clients, company officers say, to experience improvements in their disorders after 30 45-minute sessions costing about $2,000. Some insurers cover the treatments, while others have denied payment.\n\nOne denial concerned a 50-year-old woman with anxiety and migraines. The insurance company noted that it covered biofeedback for only a few conditions. An outside review commissioned by the Michigan insurance department supported the decision that biofeedback was not, in her case, an established therapy or medically necessary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts said that thus far, studies of neurofeedback for attention deficit disorder were unconvincing.

Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State University who is enrolling children in a large, blind, controlled trial of neurofeedback \u2014 the main approach Neurocore says it uses in its sessions \u2014 said the idea was theoretically appealing, but there was not yet solid evidence of its effectiveness for A.D.H.D. Neurocore\u2019s claims for the treatments \u201cpoison the well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey oversell it.\u201d\n\nHe and other experts warned of potential side effects including headaches and disrupted sleep.\n\nFederal oversight of the field is minimal. \u201cWhen it comes to treatments like this, there\u2019s no formal body,\u201d said Scott O. Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory University. \u201cThis has been a big problem. We don\u2019t have an F.D.A. for psychotherapies,\u201d he said, referring to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOver the past year, the Federal Trade Commission has begun to crack down on some companies promoting the successes of brain training programs for treating a variety of problems.\n\nLast January, Lumos Labs, the creator of Lumosity games, agreed to pay a $2 million fine over advertising claims that said its educational-oriented games could help children perform better in school by targeting specific areas of the brain. A few months later, the F.T.C. imposed sanctions on the developers of the LearningRx \u201cbrain training\u201d programs for advertisements that claimed its product could \u201cpermanently improve serious health conditions\u201d like A.D.H.D., autism and dementia.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Neurocore promotes its ties to the Orlando Magic, which is owned by the DeVos family, and other professional athletes have appeared in advertisements for the company.\n\nDr. Fotuhi, Neurocore\u2019s chief medical officer, said that there were no physicians on site at the clinics, but social workers supervise lower-level technicians, who administer the neurofeedback. Employment ads show that Neurocore\u2019s social workers are offered less than $20 an hour to start, yet are responsible for diagnostic assessments of patients with complex problems.\n\nOne technician, Bashar Salah, who worked for Neurocore as a new college graduate during the summer of 2015 in Sterling Heights, Mich., said some of his colleagues were still students. He earned $10 or $11 an hour, he said, \u201cbetter than working at McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s, or a lot of other places that paid roughly minimum wage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Salah said he had known nothing about biofeedback before starting the job, but received training at Neurocore, where the employees seemed \u201cinterested in improving people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nAmanda Farmer, who said she worked as a technician at a Neurocore center in Okemos, Mich., for eight months in 2012, watched potential clients get a hard sell.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were skeptical, and they gloss over any of the real questions: \u2018Are you sure? This seems like a lot of money. What happens if it doesn\u2019t do anything?\u2019\u201d Ms. Farmer recalled. Other current and former employees expressed similar misgivings.\n\nExperts say there is not much standardization in the field of biofeedback, and techniques vary.\n\nDr. Fotuhi has impressive credentials: an M.D. from Harvard and Ph.D. in neuroscience from Johns Hopkins. However, his short-lived previous venture, NeurExpand Brain Centers in Maryland, folded after Medicare refused to reimburse services and demanded repayment for lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness, Dr. Fotuhi said in 2015 to Bethesda Magazine.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Fotuhi said Neurocore\u2019s chief executive, Mark Murrison, who has been at the company for about two years, \u201chas an emphasis on research and development and using science-based protocols.\u201d He said the company would be publishing its results in peer-reviewed scientific literature soon.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that our clients are highly satisfied with the care they receive and that we are able to help transform the lives of our clients for the better,\u201d Dr. Fotuhi added in a statement.\n\nMs. DeVos maintains her interest in Neurocore even as she said she would divest from 102 companies and investment funds, including a family vehicle that backs business start-ups. Ms. DeVos and her husband are invested in Neurocore through the Windquest Group, their family office.\n\nExperts said that Ms. DeVos, as a result of the investment, might have to recuse herself from discussions about the efficacy of using brain-training strategies to help school-age children. A spokesman for Ms. DeVos, however, disagreed that her stake in Neurocore was problematic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe reject the notion that the judgment of the Office of Government Ethics is incapable of identifying potential conflicts of interests, or that the judgment of the professionals who work there should be supplemented or supplanted by personal opinions and partisan recommendations,\u201d said Ed Patru, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos.\n\nMs. DeVos is expected to receive enough votes from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 and eventually the full Senate \u2014 for confirmation.

It is the place where the nation\u2019s deepest intelligence secrets, its fluctuating hierarchy of national interests and its jockeying-for-power cabinet members combine as policy differences are hashed out. It is the forum where decisions about war, from Vietnam to Iraq; drone strikes in Pakistan; and conflicts in cyberspace have unfolded over endless hours of meetings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, with stakes that large, it has always been about politics \u2014 from grand strategy to petty scorekeeping. Here is a quick look.\n\nSo what is the National Security Council, and why does it exist?\n\nThe nation lived without the council for more than 150 years, until World War II ended and the immense responsibilities of managing the world \u2014 and the atomic bomb \u2014 descended on President Harry S. Truman. The council was created in 1947, when the C.I.A. and the Defense Department came into being. Like most things in Washington, it started small and, over time, ballooned to such size that every new president swears the first thing he will do is pare it back.\n\nWhich, of course, never really happens.\n\nWhy is it viewed as so powerful?\n\nPresidents of both parties have one thing in common: They are control freaks. And the council becomes the instrument of control. \u201cEach individual president has tremendous latitude to shape both the institution of the N.S.C. and the formal and informal mechanisms of his or her White House national security apparatus,\u201d David Rothkopf wrote in his history of the council, \u201cRunning the World.\u201d\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe council is \u201call about the influence of one person,\u201d Mr. Rothkopf wrote.\n\nThe formal instrument is the \u201cprincipals committee,\u201d made up of the president, the vice president and all those jockeying cabinet members. That is what Mr. Bannon joins, meaning he won the first week\u2019s access-trust-influence sweepstakes. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence, who were regular members of the council under President Barack Obama, would attend if \u201cissues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\u201d\n\n(The White House points to similar language in President George W. Bush\u2019s orders for his council, though there was no director of national intelligence at the time.)\n\nIf I\u2019m a foreign diplomat, whom do I deal with? The secretary of state, or the national security adviser?\n\nThat depends who you are. Back in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, the national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, carved out a few countries he dealt with himself, chiefly China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. But the council is not supposed to set policy \u2014 it is not supposed to be \u201coperational.\u201d Of course, it frequently is. Get on the plane of the secretary of state or the secretary of defense, and you will almost always run into a council representative, who can keep an eye on things and call back to the White House. During the Iran nuclear negotiations, the council representative was a key player. It has gotten to the point where the council has its tentacles into everything.\n\nWho did the job of national security adviser best?\n\nIn Washington, this is the kind of argument people have in bars. (Well, some people.) But on this issue, there is fairly widespread bipartisan consensus: Brent Scowcroft, who served as President George H. W. Bush\u2019s national security adviser, \u201cis widely viewed as one of the most effective people who has ever held that job,\u201d the Aspen Strategy Group, which studied the future of the national security structure last summer, concluded in a recent report.\n\nHenry Kissinger might disagree: As President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, he ran circles around the secretary of state, negotiated to end the Vietnam War and conducted the secret diplomacy with China that created Nixon\u2019s opening. When he became secretary of state, he held onto the national security adviser job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo who actually does the work?\n\nThe council has a staff that numbers several hundred professionals \u2014 most borrowed from the State Department, the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies and other government agencies for two years or so.\n\nAs with everything in the White House, real estate guides the path to power. So the national security adviser has a big spacious corner office visible from the driveway of the West Wing, and several senior officials are stuffed into windowless offices in the basement, some right under the floor of the Oval Office.\n\nMuch of the day-to-day decision-making is done by the \u201cdeputies committee,\u201d where subcabinet officers, and their designees, sit in seemingly endless meetings in the Situation Room to debate out differences, create policy and push the hardest issues to the president and his top advisers. Intelligence officials often open those meetings, providing assessments of what is happening around the world. (They are not supposed to delve into policy suggestions, but it has happened.)\n\nThis makes the deputy national security adviser, who convenes those meetings, the most powerful person in Washington that most people have never heard of. It also makes them one of the palest, since they rarely see the sun.\n\nBannon can\u2019t be the first political operative ever to sit in on council meetings.\n\nHe isn\u2019t. During the Obama administration, David Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief political adviser, often sat in on council meetings. But he was never a formal member. Susan E. Rice, who was national security adviser until 11 days ago, called the decision to downgrade the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the director of national intelligence \u201cstone cold crazy.\u201d", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/31/us/31NSC/31NSC-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 04:44:44 GMT", "summary": "The council is the place where the nation\u2019s deepest intelligence secrets and its jockeying-for-power cabinet members combine.", "source": "New York Times", "authors": ["DAVID E.

That\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his aides have contended that the immigration order is not a Muslim ban because it does not affect several predominantly Muslim countries. They have also argued that it is similar to actions Mr. Obama took, including a six-month ban on refugees from Iraq he instituted in 2011, and a requirement his administration added in 2015 that travelers from the same seven countries have visas for entering the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the 2011 action, which only affected one country, was in response to specific threat information about Iraqis seeking to use the refugee program to enter the United States and carry out terrorist acts.

That nominee was John G. Tower, who was nominated for defense secretary by President George Bush in 1989. He was rejected by a 53-to-47 vote amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest and his personal life.\n\nFrustrated by Republicans\u2019 insistence last year on stalling President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court, Democrats are less interested in playing nice on nominations, and there is a sense that Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order only worsened matters.\n\nAs Mr. Trump teased the prime-time television announcement of his Supreme Court nominee, scheduled for Tuesday, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon became the first Democrat to vow to block any nominee other than Mr. Garland. It was a potent threat, considering Supreme Court nominees can still be filibustered.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy point is that this is a stolen seat,\u201d Mr. Merkley said in an interview on Monday. He said that because Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on Mr. Garland\u2019s nomination, no other nominee was a \u201clegitimate\u201d pick.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, criticized Democrats for suggesting they would probably block whomever Mr. Trump nominated. The argument is sure to raise Democratic ire considering Mr. McConnell\u2019s vow less than a year ago to block anyone Mr. Obama nominated shortly after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe Senate should respect the result of the election and treat this newly elected president\u2019s nominee in the same way that nominees of other newly elected presidents have been treated,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on Monday. \u201cAnd that is with careful consideration, followed by an up-or-down vote.\u201d\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the lawmakers were also invigorated by a second straight weekend of nationwide protests.\n\nAs the evening approached, Mr. Schumer called for a vote on a Democratic bill that would overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order, a request that requires consent from majority Republicans.\n\n\u201cSo many of you know it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor, appealing to his Republican colleagues. \u201cI understand party loyalty, I do. But this order goes so against the American grain that there are higher values at stake.\u201d\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, objected, and effectively ended the discussion.

This Senate confirmation process begins with partisan payback in the air.\n\nThat is on top of what was evident last February when Scalia died suddenly at a remote Texas hunting resort: The Supreme Court is deeply divided and every vote matters. A single justice among the nine can tip the balance on civil rights, criminal law and corporate regulation.\n\nRarely has there been a moment in American history of such widespread national discord, internal court divisions, and the opportunity for a new tie-breaking justice.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny reported Tuesday that the two leading candidates are believed to be Neil Gorsuch , who sits on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and Thomas Hardiman , who sits on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Pittsburgh. Both have met with Trump.\n\nThe jurist who eventually secures the lifetime post will likely decide the law not just for this generation but for the next.\n\nScalia, who died a month short of his 80th birthday, served for three decades, and given the relatively youthfulness of the finalists for tonight's announcement, a new justice could sit on the bench for 30 years as well.\n\nConstitutional confrontations\n\nThe nation's judiciary serves as a check on the legislative and executive branches. Not even two weeks as president, Trump has spurred a raft of controversy and litigation, particularly to his order last Friday temporarily barring refugees and certain other foreigners from entering the country.\n\nMost divisive is the part blocking entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries even if their visas were valid.\n\nOver his eight years as president, Barack Obama undertook numerous initiatives that were challenged in federal courts, including on immigration, health care and environmental regulation.\n\nBut none of his moves prompted such instant litigation and protest, which played out with demonstrations at the nation's airports and in public squares over the weekend. Lower court judges have temporarily suspended parts of the order.\n\nTrump, who has expressed pride in his disruptive ways, has asserted that the refugee restrictions would improve national security and protect the country from terrorists. Congressional leaders from both parties, along with immigration experts and legal analysts, have condemned the policy. Many say it is counterproductive to security interests and unlawful.\n\nThe ultimate arbiter of the constitutionality of Trump's sweeping new moves would be the Supreme Court.\n\nA Polarized Court\n\nOn the current bench sit four Republican appointees who generally vote conservative (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) and four Democratic appointees who regularly vote liberal (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan).\n\nScalia was a reliable right-wing vote, which made the court one of the most conservative in modern times. With Scalia, it curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies for discrimination; allowed more prayer in public places; and restricted class-action lawsuits brought by aggrieved workers and consumers against big corporations.\n\nYet, because of Kennedy's centrist tendencies, conservatives were unable to roll back significantly abortion rights, as established by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, or race-based policies intended to enhance student diversity at universities, as allowed under the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.\n\nKennedy, who cast the deciding votes to affirm abortion rights and campus affirmative action in 2016, was also the crucial fifth vote to declare a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in 2015\n\nHe remains on the bench, but he is 80 years old and has indicated to some close friends and associates an interest in retiring. If he were to step down in the near future, and Trump made successive nominations, he could transform the court and the law in America.\n\nTrump has said he is looking for justices who would reverse Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide. He has said he wants states to have the power to determine when a woman has the right to end a pregnancy.\n\nOther retirements are possible. Ginsburg, who will turn 84 in March, is the court's eldest justice. Breyer will turn 79 in August.\n\nRecalling Merrick Garland\n\nSenate Democrats and their liberal allies anticipate such near-term potential for change. With Republicans still holding the majority in the chamber, 52-48, Democrats know it would be difficult to derail Trump's choice.\n\nBut they appear prepared to make the confirmation process as rocky as possible to dissuade Trump from an especially conservative choice if a more consequential vacancy arises, for example, with a Kennedy retirement.\n\nDemocrats have tried to focus public attention on the Republican Senate majority's 10-month refusal to act on Obama's March 16 nomination of Merrick Garland , a former prosecutor who is chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has suggested she would support a filibuster of Trump's nominee. That would require 60 votes to cut off debate, rather than a simple majority for approval.\n\nIt's unclear how real the threat of a filibuster may be. Democrats privately discussed their tactics during a closed-door retreat in West Virginia last week, CNN's Manu Raju reported , and some in the party tried to persuade liberal firebrands to let Republicans confirm Trump's pick -- citing fears the GOP might gut the rules regarding the filibuster in retaliation for blocking the nominee.\n\nResponding to Democratic filibuster warnings, Republican Sen. Bob Corker, of Tennessee quipped, \"I've never heard of people filibustering someone before they know who it is. I mean it could be Merrick Garland.\"", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160623194334-supreme-court-justices-2-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:46:47 GMT", "summary": "When President Donald Trump presents his nominee for the Supreme Court with all the White House pageantry Tuesday night, much more will be riding on this coveted appointment than when Justice Antonin Scalia died last February and created the opening.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "keywords": ["supreme", "republican", "end", "trump", "scalia", "rights", "justice", "starts", "marks", "vote", "trumps", "pick", "battle", "court", "president"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump watch: Live coverage", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/JIle0drOQdg/index.html", "text": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

But on a more fundamental level, it is raising basic questions about how Trump's White House will function.\n\nOn Monday evening, officials at the Department of Homeland Security were still spending hours in back-and-forth conversations with the White House. One source described receiving \"cleared talking points\" only to be called back minutes later to say they weren't right. The source said pages and pages of questions regarding interpretation of the travel bans were still being sent to the White House from the department.\n\nJUST WATCHED GOP on Defense after Trump's Actions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH GOP on Defense after Trump's Actions 03:17\n\n\"These sort of amateur hour hijinks are costing President Trump precious political capital ahead of his aggressive legislative push,\" said Howard Schweitzer, a former high-ranking official in Republican and Democratic administrations. \"The PR debacle and failure to circulate this plan with leaders in Congress or our allies was a costly error and overwhelms any of the legitimate policies behind his order.\"\n\nTrump's rocky opening days come just as the administration needs to be at the top of its game ahead of Trump's announcement of his Supreme Court pick Tuesday night.\n\nTuesday's unveiling of a Supreme Court nominee will test whether he can win over crucial backing in Washington. In a polarized political atmosphere, a seamless introduction of a potential justice would strain even the most experienced West Wing, let alone a staff that has only been in place for less than two weeks and is already under fire.\n\nIf the administration clean up on the immigration order succeeds, there may be no lingering political price to be paid. But if the Supreme Court push staggers out of the gate, the Trump team could face an early political crisis on two fronts that will cast doubt on its capacity to enact its ambitious congressional agenda.\n\nAll new administrations have teething problems and it's not unusual for even experienced West Wing staffs to fumble badly. The disastrous debut of the Obamacare website in 2013 played into GOP claims that the law was botched by an incompetent administration.\n\nAnd there is no doubt that Trump is doing exactly what voters who rewarded him with 306 electoral votes sent him to Washington to do.\n\nThere is a strong sense in many parts of the country that the US government has been too lax in its vetting of Muslim visitors to the US out of a sense of political correctness. And while chaos reigned at the weekend, Trump's penchant for stirring confusion with his improvisational management style has often served him well as a businessman and in his short, successful political career.\n\nPresidential brand\n\nStill, one of the president's central claims to the White House is that he, and only he, can cut through what he portrays as dire problems facing Americans. So any hint of incompetence could damage his presidential brand and undercut his claims that his business tycoon personality can get things done.\n\nThe administration's defense of its actions Monday followed a now familiar tactic -- attacking the media for its coverage and fogging the facts with an alternative narrative.\n\n\"I think this has been blown way out of proportion and exaggerated,\" said White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday. \"I think frankly government functioned very well. That's the takeaway from this, that the system worked well, the country is safer for it.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Entire White House remarks on immigration Replay More Videos ...

They were temporarily detained to make sure that the safety of the other 324 million Americans was put first. I don't see how that's a big problem,\" Spicer said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said in a tweet that it would have been foolhardy to have announced his policy in advance, as it would tipped off terrorists.\n\n\"If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad 'dudes' out there!\" Trump tweeted Monday.\n\nThough advancing a hardball national security argument, Spicer appeared to indicate on Monday there was no specific intelligence suggesting an attack was imminent from nationals of any of the seven listed nations.\n\n\"I think what we're trying to say is you don't know when the next threat is coming,\" Spicer said.\n\nTerrorism experts have pointed out, however, that none of the terror attacks on US soil since 9/11 emanated from any of the seven nations targeted by Trump.\n\nAdministrative confusion\n\nThe sense of administrative confusion in the government also undermines White House claims that everything went smoothly. Minutes before Trump signed the order in the Oval Office on Friday, his counsellor Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the immigration measure would not be issued that day. And in the hours after its release the White House struggled to explain exactly what it meant and which nations it would impact.\n\nMeanwhile, it seems instructions for how to enforce the new rules did not reach the officials on the front line \u2014 at America's airports \u2014 sparking delays and confusion.\n\n\"At the operator level, there was confusion and that needed to be flushed out and perhaps still needs to be flushed out,\" said James Norton, a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Department of Homeland Security during the Bush administration.\n\nAmerica's borders are policed by a diverse collection of officials from Customs, Immigration and Citizenship agencies and not all were clear what the new rules entailed.\n\nThat may explain uncertainty over whether green card holders were affected.\n\nUS allies were still puzzled Monday with the implications of the ruling. Britain said UK dual nationals would not be stopped from entering the US. Germany was not so sure.\n\nThere was also intense frustration on Capitol Hill, where GOP aides rejected the rationale that they were kept in the dark for national security reasons.\n\n\"If that's their approach going forward in terms of engaging the Hill on national security issues, then they're going to find out that the results are more than just a weekend of bad press,\" said one aide who asked not to speak for attribution.\n\nSpicer denied that the White House had left its congressional allies and government agencies in the dark.\n\n\"Everybody was kept in the loop at the level necessary to make sure that we rolled it out properly,\" he said.\n\nBut Schweitzer, who has piloted the Senate confirmation process of 20 presidential nominees, warned that if the White House did not up its managerial game, it would be offering an opening to its opponents.\n\n\"Trump's executive order was poorly written and implemented, and has generated so much negative press that it's reinforcing the Left's image of the Trump White House as xenophobic, incompetent hardliners,\" he said.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170130171650-trump-refugee-ban-signing-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:20:26 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump begins his 11th day in office shrouded in crisis, roundly criticized for a chaotic unveiling of immigration measures and under new scrutiny after he fired the nation's top law enforcement officer who refused to enforce them.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly", "Stephen Collinson", "Rene Marsh"], "keywords": ["trump", "yates", "justice", "house", "political", "immigration", "early", "donald", "trumps", "department", "president", "white", "crisis"], "tags": []}, {"title": "The real estate mogul's architect: Bannon's influence swells", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/afbv8B8_mL0/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) To outsiders looking in, President Donald Trump's decision to give his chief strategist Steve Bannon a permanent seat with the National Security Council's most senior officials marked the startling elevation of a political adviser to a policy-making role.\n\nBut for Trump administration insiders, Bannon's appointment was little more than a natural evolution of his status as one of the President's most trusted and influential advisers.\n\nThat's because Bannon's role has long eclipsed that of traditional political strategist, with the former head of the right-wing Breitbart News site quickly taking custody of Trump's political and policy agendas not just as tactician, but as one of its chief architects.\n\nThat role will now officially extend to crafting the Trump foreign policy, placing a firebrand who has repeatedly targeted the Republican establishment and called for a radical reshaping of the US' role in the world in a prime position to reshape the current world order -- not just for the term of Trump's presidency, but for decades to come.\n\nAlready in just the first week of Trump's presidency, Bannon has steered Trump toward implementing many of the course-altering foreign policy actions Trump touted during the campaign, with Trump signing a series of executive actions to torpedo the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal, order the construction of a massive border wall and temporarily ban citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries while also suspending admissions of refugees into the US.\n\nBannon was a particularly formidable force on the latter, overruling -- with White House policy director Stephen Miller -- the Department of Homeland Security's more narrow reading of Trump's executive order by directing federal officials to also bar green card holders from one of those seven countries from entering the US. Those legal US permanent residents will now need to apply for a waiver to leave and return to the US, for at least the next 90 days.\n\nThe flood of first-week actions are typical of Bannon's style, whose modus operandi is to always be on the offense, people familiar with his thinking said.\n\n\"He wants to flood the zone,\" a person who has worked with Bannon said. \"If you can move fast to overwhelm the opposition, you'll get a lot more gains than if you do it incrementally ...

It only makes sense to have him in this role listening to what's going on so he, too, can report back to the President,\" Miller said. \"He also has such a keen understanding of the President's voice.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Tapper: Bannon addition to NSC a mystery Replay More Videos ...

Bannon, by contrast, is arguably the most ideological member of Trump's inner circle of top advisers and now finds himself in the position of filling that vacuum -- and fleshing out Trump-ism with his own philosophy.\n\nWhile Trump arrived at his populist viewpoint seemingly by instinct, Bannon became the \"economic nationalist\" he now calls himself through a decades-long intellectual pursuit -- one that took him through the pages of history and philosophy books that have profoundly impacted his worldview.\n\nBannon has often leaned on history to argue for more extreme measures to counter \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" arguing the \"Judeo-Christian West\" is once again facing a \"crisis\" akin to the battles Europeans waged to fend off assaults by Muslim armies. It's an ideology he's since worked to spread in the US and abroad, through the Breitbart News platform, which has run Islamophobic stories and race-baiting headlines.\n\nBeyond US counterterrorism policy, Bannon is poised to be a driving force behind the radical reshaping of the US's trade policy and its attitude toward China.\n\nThe death knell to TPP last week was little more than a warning shot signaling to the world that Trump was serious about following through on the protectionist rhetoric that helped him win the presidency and Bannon, who has often cited his blue-collar roots, is gearing up to help craft those policies in line with his goals of shaping a movement that continues to draw the union workers who flocked to Trump's candidacy in 2016 and can outlast Trump's presidency.\n\nAnd he is taking his most outsized role in the administration's foreign policy by helping to drive discussions on US-China policy. Privately, he has pushed to implement the border tariff Trump threatened during the campaign and invited comparisons between Trump's populist inaugural address with its \"America First\" proclamation and the Chinese President's defense of globalization just days earlier.\n\nWhile Bannon has no significant foreign policy experience that would earn him a seat on the National Security Council, he is a former US naval officer who worked on the Naval Operations staff at the Pentagon and the former Goldman Sachs banker and hedge fund manager is well-versed in economic issues and global trendlines.\n\nMiller, the former Trump spokesman, argued Bannon is \"one of the leading national experts on this global trend of economic populism and economic nationalism we're seeing all across the entire world.\"\n\n\"Issues of economic geopolitical stability are national security issues also,\" Miller said.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170130155341-bannon-01-25-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 17:58:11 GMT", "summary": "To outsiders looking in, President Donald Trump's decision to give his chief strategist Steve Bannon a permanent seat with the National Security Council's most senior officials marked the startling elevation of a political adviser to a policy-making role.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Jeremy Diamond"], "keywords": ["real", "trump", "estate", "moguls", "national", "nsc", "influence", "steve", "policy", "economic", "architect", "trumps", "presidents", "swells", "role", "security", "bannons", "bannon"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Dems delay committee vote on Sessions AG nomination", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/T1eKrgWRtDc/index.html", "text": "Story highlights Democrats have fought Sessions' nomination\n\nHe is expected to be advanced to the full Senate\n\nWashington (CNN) The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed voting Tuesday morning on the nomination of Sen.

Numerous officials told CNN the traditional inter-agency process had been side-stepped and the White House largely worked on the order in isolation.\n\nHow to deal with US green card holders shifted as the order was put in place. At first, DHS interpreted the order to not apply to legal permanent residents and issued that to airlines. The White House overruled that on Friday night, before later clarifying that judgments would be made on a case-by-case basis and legal permanent residents would be allowed in barring other concerns.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan acknowledged Tuesday that communication broke down, after he faced repeated questions from the press about why airlines were given contradictory guidance, why individuals were detained for hours, and about reports that some individuals were given forms to sign giving up their residency status, as well as why the Department of Defense was not aware as of Monday that Special Immigrant Visa holders were allowed to enter.\n\n\"I think it's fair to acknowledge that communications, publicly and inter-agency, haven't been the best in the rollout of this process,\" McAleenan said, in the only instance in the news conference that implementation could have been better handled.\n\nKelly said on Tuesday that he had seen \"at least two\" drafts of the order, and that he was aware the order would be signed Friday as of Thursday night.\n\n\"I did know it was under development, had an opportunity to look at at least two, as I recollect, drafts as it got closer to Friday,\" Kelly said, when asked for specifics on who was involved. \"Don't exactly know other than my legal shop representatives were involved, I would imagine some, on the landing team (from the transition), I would imagine some of them, but the point is, it came to the department, it was on a close-hold basis.\"\n\nKelly said \"only the people that needed it,\" including himself and agency lawyers, were given access. \"It was a back-and-forth process, I did talk to a representative in the White House oh probably earlier in the week about where it was going,\" he said. \"Pretty busy week, I didn't get involved in correcting grammar or reformatting the thing.\"\n\nAfter his confirmation hearing, Kelly was briefed on all the immigration executive orders under consideration by the administration and then was given the text a few days before inauguration, a White House source told CNN. Briefings also included senior department heads and staffs, as well as \"beachhead\" teams from the administration in agencies.\n\nThe order was also signed off on by the Office of Legal Counsel and the Homeland Security Council and National Security Council, the source said.\n\nKelly said anyone who had been following Trump's campaign wouldn't be surprised by the travel ban order, but he remained vague on the extent of the involvement of the interagency process.\n\n\"I knew he was going to sign an order about a year and half or two years before he became President-elect,\" Kelly said. \"From Day 1, in terms of the inauguration, finishing touches, I have to put it that way, were being put on the executive order. ... People on my staff were generally involved.\"\n\nDepartment officials also gave updated numbers on the impact of the order.\n\nMcAleenan said in the first 72 hours, 1 million travelers came to the US by air, including 500,000 foreign nationals. He said 721 individuals were denied boarding, but 1,060 legal permanent residents of the US were processed for waivers to enter the US and an additional 75 waivers were given to visa holders.\n\nThat went beyond the 109 that the White House said were affected because they were in transit when the order was signed -- numbers that the department officials said only applied to the first day of the order.\n\nKelly also pushed back strongly on any characteristic of the order as targeting Muslims.\n\n\"This is not -- I repeat -- not a ban on Muslims,\" Kelly said. \"Religious liberty is one of our most treasured values\"\n\nHe noted that the seven countries in the order were the same designated by Congress and the Obama administration for special attention in the past, saying some are in \"various states of collapse.\" The goal, Kelly said, was to allow the US to better screen travelers for terror risk.\n\n\"It is easier to play defense on the 50 yard line than the one yard line,\" Kelly said. \"I will not gamble American lives.\"", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170110150720-john-kelly-jan-3-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:58:20 GMT", "summary": "The newly installed secretary of homeland security on Tuesday defended the rollout of the controversial executive order by President Donald Trump over the weekend, saying that he and his agency had been fully involved its drafting.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Tal Kopan"], "keywords": ["given", "signed", "house", "executive", "legal", "white", "defends", "kelly", "chief", "individuals", "trumps", "involved", "rollout", "security", "dhs", "order"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump is doing exactly what he said, part II", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/uO5aG0f9RFo/index.html", "text": "(CNN) In the stretch run of the 2016 campaign, columnist and CNN contributor Salena Zito identified a fault line in the tumultuous relationship between the news media and Trump supporters. The press, she wrote , had taken then-candidate Donald Trump \"literally, but not seriously,\" while his backers regarded his statements \"seriously, but not literally.\"\n\nIf you're not familiar with her now pervasive chestnut, Zito's point was this: many reporters missed out on Trump's appeal because they were too caught up analyzing (or criticizing) the details of his most extreme promises and threats. Trump supporters, by contrast, were less concerned with the vagaries of border wall construction than hearing their frustrations and resentment recited back to them.\n\nAs a piece of cultural analysis, the argument still resonates. But when pressed up against the reality of the new administration's first ten days, it dissipates. Trump has shown during his brief time in office that he should have been, and should be, taken both seriously and literally -- by everyone.\n\nIn an unprecedented blitz of executive actions, the new administration continues to implement or set the traps for a raft of the campaign's most controversial pledges. A vague order delivered late Friday night, immediately and without notice to a number of federal agencies and hundreds of affected travelers , barred for 90 days the entry of \"immigrants and nonimmigrants\" from seven Muslim-majority nations into the US. The same order temporarily shutdown the US refugee program. Syrian refugees have been denied safe harbor indefinitely.\n\nTrump's executive actions capped off a dizzying week that saw congressional Republicans, dedicated for a generation to blocking new spending, promising to pay for the border wall , while the mostly Democratic mayors of sanctuary cities began to carve out a legal bulwark against the President's demand they be cut off from federal funding.\n\nWhether or not Trump's early actions will withstand a growing backlash that began on the streets and has spread to corporate boardrooms and into the offices of some elected leaders is an open question. But there are few signs he plans to defer to public opinion -- at least that of the public which opposed him from the outset.\n\nJUST WATCHED Protesters swarm airports nationwide Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protesters swarm airports nationwide 01:33\n\nThere are also legal questions. Some of the initial flurry, like the travel and refugee bans, have arrived in the form of enforceable orders. They will face court challenges, but there are already worries the administration will ignore or sidestep judicial orders. His memo inviting the pipeline company TransCanada to \"promptly re-submit its application\" to jumpstart the Keystone XL project was, in effect, a very formal press release, but one that represented a clear statement of intent.\n\nBy midday Tuesday, when Trump's Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline memos were made public, the Native American tribe potentially affected by construction was considering its court options and the coalition of activists who camped out for months in the planned path of the DAPL were scheduling flights back to North Dakota . That night, and over the weekend, protests sprung up (for the third time in a week) across the country.\n\nCertain bits of campaign rhetoric have been left behind on the trail. When the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, canceled a planned meeting in Washington after publicly refusing to pay for a border wall, as Trump continues to insist he will, there was no subsequent threat to build it \"ten feet higher.\" Instead, the White House organized a phone call between the leaders. Trump was uncharacteristically withholding of its details.\n\nIt was easy to dismiss as bluster -- a serious, if cheeky, argument against the strategic path taken by the US in its conflict with with ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria. But some of candidate Trump's most headline-grabbing bluster has manifested itself in quieter ways. Trump insisted on the stump that he \"knows more about ISIS than the generals do.\"It was easy to dismiss as bluster -- a serious, if cheeky, argument against the strategic path taken by the US in its conflict with with ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBut as seen in his drastic Sunday reshuffling of the National Security Council, which will no longer count the director of national intelligence or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as members of its central \"principles committee,\" he took action -- i n a very literal way -- to assert his judgment and those of his increasingly closed inner circle ahead of \"the generals.\"\n\nSo what comes next?\n\nNo tea leaves required -- Google and Trump's campaign website should be considered the most reliable of sources.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170127120116-trump-at-dhs-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 11:05:36 GMT", "summary": "In the stretch run of the 2016 campaign, columnist and CNN contributor Salena Zito identified a fault line in the tumultuous relationship between the news media and Trump supporters.

Pryor sits on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and he is a dream candidate for many conservatives. He's called Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, an \"abomination.\" He's a committed member of the Federalist Society, and in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, believes that the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original public meaning.\n\nJudge William Pryor, U.S. Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit, moderates a panel discussion during the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\n\"I am a conservative, and I believe in the strict separation of governmental powers,\" Pryor wrote in 1997 when he was attorney general of Alabama. \"Courts should not resolve political problems.\"\n\nPryor has faced the Senate gauntlet before.\n\nIn 2004, Democrats blocked his confirmation to the appellate court, and it was only in June 2005 that he was officially confirmed by a vote of 53-45.\n\nBut despite Pryor's record, some conservatives have questioned an opinion he joined that they perceive as expanding transgender rights.\n\nNeil Gorsuch\n\nGorsuch, who sits on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Colorado, has never called Roe an abomination. In fact, he's never had the occasion to write an opinion addressing Roe.\n\nThat might disappoint some who want to make sure that he wouldn't surprise them on the issue.\n\nSwearing in of Coloradan Neil M. Gorsuch as the newest member of the, United States Court Of Appeals For The Tenth Circuit. (Denver Post Photo By John Prieto)\n\nBut he's become a favored candidate in part because of his opinions on religious liberty including one he joined siding with closely held corporations who believed that the so-called contraceptive mandate of Obamacare violated their religious beliefs.\n\nAnd on more than one occasion, he's aligned himself with Scalia. In the weeks after Scalia's death last year, Gorsuch gave a talk emphasizing that \"the great project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators.\"\n\nTrump might conclude that Gorsuch could sidestep a major fight in Congress.\n\nOr not. Liberals are still seething mad that Republican senators failed to hold hearings for former President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, and could take it out on Gorsuch, or anyone else Trump picks.\n\n\"Those of us who believe that Merrick Garland was improperly denied a vote and also recognize that the majority of the American people voted for Hillary Clinton are going to refuse a nominee who moves the court in such a a right wing direction,\" said Caroline Fredrickson of the American Constitution Society. It is unclear if progressives would accept any of Trump's nominees that have been a part of his current list.\n\nDiane Sykes\n\nSykes hails from Wisconsin, a critical state during the last election and home to Trump's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\nA former journalist, she flexed her interviewing skills in 2013 by sitting down with Justice Clarence Thomas for a talk to discuss his jurisprudence. She won over the room during the event -- hosted by the Federalist Society -- for showcasing Thomas' personality in an interview that at times brought down the house.\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit Judge, Diane Sykes speaks in a discussion during the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nJust last week Sykes issued an opinion striking three provisions of Chicago regulations meant to govern shooting ranges. It was a follow up opinion from one she penned in 2011 that enjoined Chicago's ban on firing ranges within city limits. Both opinions are peppered with references to Scalia's landmark Second Amendment opinion, District of Columbia v. Heller.\n\nSykes would bring another woman to the Court. She would be the fifth woman ever named, the second from a Republican candidate. But Trump could calculate that it would make more sense to save her for the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should she ever retire.\n\nSykes is also 59 years old, and some court watchers think that Trump might prefer someone younger.\n\nThomas Hardiman\n\nHardiman of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, for example, is almost a decade younger at 51 and offers Trump a compelling personal story.\n\nHardiman hails from a blue collar family in Massachusetts and was the first in his family to graduate from college, driving a cab to help pay his bills. Hardiman is not product of the Ivy League having attended Notre Dame and Georgetown.\n\nJudge Thomas Hardiman, federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, moderates a panel discussion during the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nThose close to him think that Trump might appreciate Hardiman's dry wit and the fact that while he is persuasive he doesn't take over a room.\n\nLike Sykes, Hardiman referred to Heller several times in a dissent he penned in 2013 in a case concerning gun licenses.\n\nThe opposition of Hardiman has been relatively muted and Ian Millhiser of the progressive Think Progress has written that he is \"one of the more ideologically enigmatic names on Trump's list.\" Such a sentiment could scare away conservatives who do not want a dark horse candidate.\n\nConservatives believe that George H.W. Bush missed an opportunity to shape the court when he named a relative unknown -- David Souter -- to the bench. Rather than helping create a conservative legacy, Souter became a reliable vote for the left. Some might question whether Hardiman has a robust enough record to scour and get Republicans excited.\n\nIf Trump needed a personal reference, however, he'd only need to reach out to his sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who sits on the same appellate bench.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161206113020-trump-supreme-court-nominee-t1-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 23:20:12 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump has made clear he's winnowed down his list of potential Supreme Court nominees -- and may be days away from making the announcement.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Cnn Supreme Court Reporter"], "keywords": ["examining", "supreme", "appeals", "court", "trump", "pryor", "hes", "list", "trumps", "circuit", "judge", "opinion", "think", "contenders"], "tags": []}, {"title": "What to know about Trump's visa and refugee restrictions", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/DWLD_RoAsuI/index.html", "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's road to the White House was paved in part with hard-line promises such as building a \"great, great wall\" along the US-Mexico border and outright banning immigration from any nations \"compromised by terrorism.\"\n\nAfter a week in office, Trump has sought to make these dramatic steps the pillars of his national security policy, scrawling his signature on executive orders aimed at reshaping immigration across the United States.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the latest controversial actions.\n\nWhat immigration restrictions are under consideration?\n\nThe same order also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated for nationals of countries that Trump's Cabinet believes can be properly vetted.\n\nThe total number of refugees admitted into the United States will be capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to ban Muslim immigrants from countries with a \"proven history\" of terrorism against the United States or its allies.\n\nFriday's executive order gives the Department of Homeland Security leeway to prioritize refugee claims \"on the basis of religious based persecution\" as long as the person applying for refugee status is \"a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"\n\nThat would make it easier for Christians and other religious minorities in majority-Muslim countries to enter the United States than it would for Muslims in general.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump to take action on refugees, visas Replay More Videos ...

Here are the number of total US non-immigrant and immigrant visas issued to the affected countries in 2015: 15,509 to Iraq; 42,542 to Iran; 3,575 to Libya; 1,409 to Somalia; 11,962 to Syria; 2,153 to Sudan and 7,668 to Yemen.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump on Syrian refugees Replay More Videos ...

Five courts temporarily blocked the President's order on travel restrictions, and while Congress hasn't passed legislation, they did voice loud concerns.\n\nIt is an open question as to whether Trump and his team -- advisers like Steve Bannon who never worked in government -- will learn a hard lesson about governing and all its implications, or whether stirring controversy and doing things differently, is exactly what they think Trump was elected to do.'\n\nRubio: State wouldn't discuss ban\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, told reporters that his staff called the State Department earlier Monday, only to have department staff say they were instructed not to answer any questions on the travel ban.\n\n\"My staff was told the State Department as of today was ordered not to talk to Congress about this issue. I don't know the reason maybe perhaps they're still kind of working through how this is going to apply so perhaps they don't want to give us information that's wrong,\" Rubio said.\n\nThe State Department said it will \"provide information and assistance as we are able.\"\n\n\"The Department remains in contact with Members of Congress who have reached out regarding the Executive Orders, and will continue to provide information and assistance as we are able,\" said acting spokesman Mark Toner's response.\"\n\nRubio said the Trump administration needs to find a way to answer questions about the ban and how it is being implemented.\n\n\"There's no doubt they'll have to at least issue a number of clarifications about how it applies,\" Rubio, a former GOP presidential contender, said. \"From what I've heard from multiple agencies there is still significant questions about how this is supposed to be applied. So this is a big change and it has a lot of moving parts and a lot of agencies and thousands of individuals task with enforcing it and applying it. Some of whom in the early stages at least we're not confident in how they were to proceed.\"\n\nRubio's office later said the department provided a general Q&A fact sheet.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170125163502-03-donald-trump-congressional-leaders-0123-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 03:13:06 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump and his team acted more like he did as a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants candidate than an orderly CEO, giving little direction to those expected to interpret and carry out orders that have real world consequences.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Dana Bash"], "keywords": ["trump", "congress", "confusion", "travel", "chaos", "think", "leads", "state", "americans", "vetting", "house", "department", "white", "gop", "say", "told"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Who is Sally Yates?", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/XnLMOR3VwL8/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates Monday night after she refused to defend his immigration order and touched off a major drama in the opening days of his presidency.\n\n\"The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.\n\nThe fast-moving events Monday thrust Yates into a standoff with the new president and into the national spotlight. Appointed by President Barack Obama, Yates had been running Trump's Justice Department until his attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, is confirmed. Before that, she had spent years defending Obama administration policies, championing changes to the criminal justice system and curtailing the federal government's use of private prisons.\n\nMonday, Yates told Justice Department lawyers not to make legal arguments defending Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees, launching herself into the biggest controversy of the opening days of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts,\" Yates said in a letter to department lawyers.\n\nHours later, she was gone, a dramatic end to her lengthy career in the department.\n\nGeorgia roots\n\nBorn in Atlanta in 1960, Yates attended the University of Georgia both as an undergrad and a law student -- becoming what the home of the Bulldogs calls a \"double dawg.\"\n\nThree years after graduating from UGA, she began her career that has spanned almost three decades within the Justice Department, according to her DOJ biography page.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 28, 2016 in Washington, DC.\n\nYates started at the end of the 1980s, working as assistant US attorney in the Northern District of Georgia. She worked her way up in a series of cases the DOJ described as including white-collar fraud and political corruption.\n\nIn 1996, Yates aided with the prosecution of Eric Rudolph, who pleaded guilty to bombing Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta during the Olympic ceremonies.\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama appointed her to run the local US attorney's office, the first time a woman had reached the position there.\n\nShe subsequently climbed the DOJ ladder almost to the very top. When former Attorney General Eric Holder informed Obama of his intention to leave the office, Obama tapped Loretta Lynch for attorney general and Yates for deputy.\n\nUnlike Lynch, who faced a divided Senate for confirmation, Yates made it through her Senate grilling with wide, bipartisan support. Georgia Sens. Johnny Isakson and David Perdue -- both Republicans -- spoke on her behalf.\n\nShe did face some pushback from conservative corners, however. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, was among those to question her sharply during her Judiciary Committee hearing, and he ultimately voted against her confirmation.\n\nThat final step points to the current irony facing Washington: The Trump administration asked Yates to stay on as attorney general after the inauguration until Sessions, Trump's nominee, could take over.\n\nYates accepted the request, and that meant Trump would have someone leading DOJ who is well outside of his ideological mold.\n\nThe current clash was set up by Trump's decision to move ahead with the immigration executive order -- suspending the refugee program and temporarily halting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries -- before Sessions was installed.\n\nThe day after Trump's order came down, a federal judge blocked part of the order. More legal challenges mounted, and Yates instructed the department not to defend the administration from them.\n\nMonday night, she was hand-delivered a letter from the White House that ended her Justice Department career.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170130185037-01-sally-yates-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 04:24:40 GMT", "summary": "President Donald Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates Monday night after she refused to defend his immigration order and touched off a major drama in the opening days of his presidency.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Eli Watkins"], "keywords": ["attorney", "sessions", "justice", "yates", "general", "trumps", "department", "president", "sally", "order", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Businesses, think tanks look to influence Trump on immigration", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/2M1Ae4tza4I/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) Businesses and some pro-economic growth Republican think tanks are worried about President Donald Trump's immigration policies -- and they're hoping that maybe the businessman in chief might be influenced by their message.\n\nTheir appeal to the famous negotiator: Think about the economy.\n\nIn just over a week of his presidency, Trump has already issued a handful of executive orders regarding immigration, including Friday's directive banning entry to the US of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe order also prompted a swift backlash from a range of businesses. Tech companies and their executives, including Facebook, Apple, Google, Lyft, Netflix and Twitter, issued rebukes of Trump's actions and pledged to help employees and individuals affected by it. Travel companies like Expedia and Trip Advisor followed suit in expressing concern, as did a host of other businesses ranging from Ford to General Electric.\n\nThe business world is now hoping to find a way to get the White House's ear on the issue and drive home an economic appeal to a President whose business background has been his main selling point.\n\nOne lobbyist with clients in multiple sectors affected by the ban said groups are trying to figure out how to translate their concern to a new administration that has been chilly to lobbying and has limited previous ties to K Street, Washington's center of lobbying.\n\n\"There is a clear effort going on on K Street to figure out the right ways to get to the administration to explain to them the negative economic impacts of some of the things they're thinking about doing and are doing,\" said the lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his clients.\n\nThe crafting of Trump's order has been mainly ascribed to his top adviser Steve Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. The impetus, according to the White House and the order, has been to fight terrorism and ensure that individuals coming to the country are properly vetted.\n\nNeither Bannon nor Miller have wide connections in Washington, making it difficult for lobbying groups to get their concerns heard on the orders.\n\n\"I think the challenge is that it appears to be a very small inner circle who are making these decisions and trying to figure out how to have real contact with that inner circle is challenging,\" the lobbyist said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. It has defended the rollout of the order, saying those who needed to be included were and that the action was taken with the urgency of security in mind.\n\nAt first after the issuance of the order, even permanent legal residents that held US green cards who were born in the seven countries affected were being detained at US airports or turned back. Others with valid visas faced the same fate. The White House has since reversed course and said green card holders are not affected by the order, unless they are flagged for posing a threat, and that others may be allowed in on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBut businesses fear that damage may already be done: Employees are unable to leave the country for fear of not being able to return, and potential tourists and clients may choose to avoid the US over concern that they not be let in -- especially given the White House leaving open the possibility of adding more countries.\n\nAnd in industries like the tech and engineering sector, companies rely heavily on an international talent pool, making preserving high-skilled immigration visas a key concern for their bottom lines.\n\nTrump has made business a key focus of his administration alongside security -- and CEOs are hoping that they can appeal to him on that side of the equation.\n\nSeveral of his critics are already on Trump's manufacturing or economic committees, which he meets with periodically, and are hoping to use that to their advantage.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick both took to Twitter over the weekend to say they'd bring their and other concerns to Trump directly.\n\n\"Please read immigration order. (Let me know) specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President,\" Musk tweeted with a link to the text.\n\n\"I'm going to use my position on Pres economic council to stand up for what's right,\" tweeted Kalanick.\n\nFord CEO Mark Fields told CNN's Poppy Harlow that he would stay on the council, despite having concerns about the particular policy. Asked if he would bring up the ban, he said: \"We will always be straight forward. We'll do it with candor, but we'll also do it with respect.\"\n\nIt's not just businesses, either. A raft of conservative and center-right think tanks are making the case that pro-immigration policies are in the whole nation's economic interest.\n\nImmigration needed to hit growth targets\n\nAt a conference on immigration reform held by the pro-market Reason Foundation on Monday, Hoover Institution fellow Tim Kane gave a presentation saying that immigration reform -- done to keep up the legal flow of immigrants into this country -- would be essential if Trump wants to meet his economic goals otherwise.\n\n\"Immigration reform will be essential to hit that 4% growth target, because without immigration, you're not going to be able to hit that 4% growth,\" Kane said, adding that he was optimistic the Trump administration would be on track given its decision to not rescind protections for undocumented immigrants brought here as children in its first week.\n\nDaniel Griswold, a fellow at George Mason University's pro-market Mercatus Center, said in a later panel that the Trump administration could vastly decrease illegal immigration by making it easier to legally hire low-skilled immigrants\n\n\"Expanding legal immigration I believe is the key to fixing our entire immigration system,\" Griswold said, citing a CATO Institute study that found increasing low-skilled immigration would boost GDP by more than 1%.\n\nAnd on Friday, another scholar at the center-right CATO Institute told a Migration Policy Institute event on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the protection for the so-called DREAMers who were brought here as children, said adopting a hard-line policy like deporting all of the 750,000 people in DACA would cost the US $280 billion in reduced economic growth over 10 years, according to his study\n\n\"This cost is not trivial,\" said Ike Brannon, a CATO visiting fellow. \"This cost of repealing this is enough money that I think you would probably have to score this (were it to go before Congress), and if you score this, you're going to find you're creating a hole in the federal budget.\"\n\nThough the White House has indicated deporting DACA recipients is not a priority, an order last week set enforcement priorities for deportation that could include DACA recipients, depending how immigration officers interpret it.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170123124754-trump-signs-executive-orders-01-23-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 12:49:49 GMT", "summary": "Businesses and some pro-economic growth Republican think tanks are worried about President Donald Trump's immigration policies -- and they're hoping that maybe the businessman in chief might be influenced by their message.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Tal Kopan"], "keywords": ["growth", "look", "house", "white", "influence", "immigration", "order", "donald", "economic", "businesses", "tanks", "making", "message", "think", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Dems hold up voting on some of Trump's Cabinet nominees", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/zeio8vbGSro/index.html", "text": "Story highlights Votes on Price and Mnuchin are now scheduled for Tuesday\n\nMcMahon's vote has been delayed until \"further notice\"\n\nWashington (CNN) A handful of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees' confirmation votes were postponed Monday, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin, Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price and Small Business Administration nominee Linda McMahon.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee will now vote on Mnuchin and Price for their Cabinet nominations at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday.

And a number of Democrats are trying to persuade liberal firebrands to essentially let Republicans confirm Trump's pick after a vigorous confirmation process -- since Trump is likely to name a conservative to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nThe reason for the tactic: Republicans are considering gutting the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats stay largely united and block Trump's first pick. By employing the so-called \"nuclear option,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could move to reduce the threshold for clearing a filibuster from 60 votes to 51 votes.\n\nThat would mean Democrats could lose leverage in the next Supreme Court fight if Trump were to replace a more liberal justice, since the GOP now has 52 seats in the Senate.\n\nPreserving the filibuster now could give Democrats more leverage in the future, proponents of this strategy say. But it would enrage the Democratic base that wants a furious Democratic response to Trump's court pick.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, a member of the Judiciary Committee told CNN he is still seething over the Republicans' decision to block Judge Merrick Garland from filling the seat when they refused to hold hearings and votes on his nomination last year.\n\n\"But I'm not going to do to President Trump's nominee what the Republicans in the Senate did to President Obama's,\" Coons said. \"I will push for a hearing and I will push for a vote.\"\n\nOther Democrats privately agreed with that sentiment.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, No. 2 in leadership, called the discussion \"speculative.\"\n\nDemocrats are divided sharply on the question, which was a heavy focus of their legislative retreat in West Virginia last week and will be a top topic at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol Tuesday.\n\nSome liberals argue they should battle anyone who is nominated in retribution for the Republicans' handling of Garland, President Barack Obama's pick for the seat left vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia almost a year ago.\n\nSome of those Democrats believe they could block a nominee for up to a year, keeping the court divided 4-4 along ideological lines in the meantime. Vocal pressure from liberal voters could complicate any move to delay a Supreme Court fight.\n\n\"I support 60 votes,\" said Judiciary Committee member Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, while acknowledging she doesn't know who will get tapped for the post. \"Sixty votes is in the Senate rules and that is how we've done it and that's how we should do it.\"\n\nBut such a move is highly risky and could trigger a harsh response from the GOP.\n\nRepublicans could retaliate by using the so-called \"nuclear option\" to lower the threshold to break a filibuster of a Supreme Court pick from 60 to 51 and easily fill this vacancy and others to come. In 2013, Democrats used the nuclear option over the objection of Republicans when they lowered the threshold to break filibusters for executive branch appointments and all other judicial nominations except the Supreme Court.\n\nYet some Democrats who oppose putting off a fight on Trump's first Supreme Court nominee argue Republicans might not have the 51 votes they would need to approve the rules change, as some senior GOP senators may be reluctant to erode the effectiveness of the 60 vote filibuster, which famously preserves the power of the Senate minority.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who opposed the Democrats' nuclear option, nevertheless has kept the option open for the Supreme Court. If Democrats were to successfully filibuster a Trump justice, the pressure from the right on McConnell could grow immensely.\n\n\"President Trump has a list of about 20 Americans who he is considering nominating to the Supreme Court. These men and women have different professional backgrounds, different life experiences,\" McConnell said on the floor, pleading with Democrats to confirm Trump's choice. \"The Senate should respect the result of the election and treat this newly-elected President's nominee in the same way the nominees of other newly-elected Presidents have been treated -- and that is with careful consideration followed by an up-or-down vote.\"\n\nIn an early salvo on the issue, Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, told Politico Monday he would filibuster virtually anyone Trump's selects for the court.\n\n\"This is a stolen seat. This is the first time a Senate majority has stolen a seat,\" Merkley said. \"We will use every lever in our power to stop this.\"\n\nOne senior Democratic aide said Merkley' s announcement was expected and that just because he launches a filibuster, it doesn't mean he would have enough Democratic votes to support it especially if Democratic leaders decide it's smarter to save the fight for a future vacancy. Moreover, some moderate Democrats up for reelection in 2018 in states Trump won overwhelmingly could presumably break ranks and help the president get his pick confirmed.\n\nLiberal firebrand Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said he wants to wait and see who the nominee is before deciding on a filibuster. Asked about Merkley's support for a filibuster, Brown replied, \"that's his decision.\"\n\nThe decision for Democrats depends partly on who Trump names. If he picks a conservative that Democrats consider \"mainstream\" -- such as Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch -- Democrats could hold off on a fight, according to the aides. But if he picks someone they consider outside the mainstream -- such as Appeals Court Judge William Pryor -- a major battle could ensue.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160623192327-scotus-super-tease.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 01:28:59 GMT", "summary": "Senate Democrats are weighing whether to avoid an all-out war to block President Donald Trump's upcoming Supreme Court pick, instead considering delaying that battle for a future nomination that could shift the ideological balance of the court, sources say.", "source": "CNN", "authors": ["Ted Barrett", "Manu Raju"], "keywords": ["supreme", "court", "trump", "senate", "big", "republicans", "votes", "dems", "pick", "battle", "filibuster", "democrats", "trumps"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Secretary of State Tillerson nomination advances to Senate", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/yr0zYPb9H0c/index.html", "text": "(CNN) The Senate voted 56-43 on Monday to end a Democratic filibuster of President Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, allowing a final confirmation vote for the former ExxonMobil CEO to take place this week.\n\nLawmakers pushed Tillerson one step closer to confirmation, possibly Wednesday, despite calls by Senate Democrats to delay the procedural cloture vote until they had a chance to question Tillerson about Trump's controversial immigration executive order.\n\nSenate Democrats also used Monday's vote as an opportunity to pound away at Trump's anti-immigration executive order and demand its repeal.\n\n\"President Trump's Muslim ban is unconstitutional and un-American,\" said Sen.

CNN's Jake Tapper reported that Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump, urged officials in the Departments of State, Homeland Security and others to disregard what he described as hysteria on television over the order.\n\nOther Trump supporters argued that the president has a mandate following a campaign in which he made his immigration views clear.\n\n\"I believe that President Trump is doing exactly what he campaigned on. He was elected President and now he is delivering the goods. People in America want to be safe,\" former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nOne senior administration official noted that the immigration move is another promise kept by Trump to his supporters following a week in which the president also addressed trade and health care through executive measures.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise to anybody that the first week went exactly as he said it would,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House's tactics.\n\nThe official argued that the temporary suspensions of entry to visitors from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen are a reasonable measure to allow time for a new system of vetting to be introduced.\n\nThe White House dismisses the idea that the measures amount to a ban on Muslims.\n\nDarker moments in history\n\nBut the targeting of nations that are overwhelmingly Muslim recalls some of the darker moments of American history when individuals or groups were singled out for special scrutiny.\n\nOnly time will tell if Trump's travel ban comes to be regarded in the same light as the Alien and Sedition Acts signed into law by President John Adams in the late 18th century, which made it easier to deport foreigners and imposed restrictions on new immigrants.\n\nOther historic parallels could include the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and the witch hunts by Senator Joseph McCarthy against alleged communists in politics and the arts in the 1950s.\n\nJUST WATCHED 5-year-old detained at airport Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 5-year-old detained at airport 00:48\n\nThe order's indefinite ban on Syrian refugee entries -- on the grounds that it is impossible to vet people from the shattered nation for terrorism links -- also means the United States is in effect turning its back on the victims of the world's worst current humanitarian crisis.\n\nBoth Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama took great care to avoid the idea that the United States was stigmatizing all Muslims while they pursued ruthless anti-terrorism campaigns against Islamic radicals.\n\nThat led critics, especially of Obama, to argue that US policy was handicapped by nuance and political correctness and an unwillingness to admit there was a threat posed by \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nTrump's actions obliterate that approach.\n\n\"'Extreme vetting' is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" said Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in a statement.\n\n\"Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions,\" he said.\n\nSenior Democrats also say Trump's measures conflict with core American values and will be ineffective as a device in cracking down on terrorism.\n\n\"This order contravenes the principles of religious liberty, equality, and compassion that our nation was founded upon in its discriminatory impact of Muslims,\" said Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"It also plays into the Al Qaeda and ISIS narrative that the West is no place for Muslims and that we are engaged in a war of civilizations.\"\n\nAs the day wore on Sunday, a number of Republicans added their voices to the criticism of the content of Trump's executive order and the way it was rolled out.\n\nNebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, a frequent Trump critic, said Trump was right to reject the notion that terrorism had no connection to Islam or certain countries, but argued the travel ban was too broad.\n\n\"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the US sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\" Sasse said.\n\nSignificantly, Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also weighed in, saying the program had been poorly implemented, especially with regard to green card holders.\n\n\"The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions,\" Corker said. The travel bans were also criticized by Republican senators Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Cory Gardner.\n\nOne of the few lawmakers to back Trump's move, GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, who chairs the House intelligence Committee, described it as a \"useful\" temporary measure to help authorities verify who was coming into the US.\n\nThe speed with which Trump instituted the travel ban has fundamentally reshaped America's course in the world and speaks to the profound political change unfolding early in his presidency.\n\nHis approach towards Muslim nations appears to be a direct repudiation of Obama's warning in a farewell speech about the new president's instincts.\n\n\"Democracy can buckle when it gives into fear. So just as we as citizens must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are,\" Obama said in Chicago earlier this month, arguing he had put the war on terror on a firmer legal footing.\n\nDamaging the image of the US\n\nThe immigration measures could also damage the image of the United States around the world and expose allied foreign leaders to significant political pressure when they cooperate with Trump.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel told Trump in a telephone call Saturday that the halt to refugee entries from Syria infringed on the Geneva Conventions, her spokesman said.British Prime Minister Theresa May, who was pictured holding hands with Trump at the White House hours before he signed the executive order on Friday, faced a backlash at home.\n\nWhile Trump's action raises philosophical questions, it is also focuses attention on the new administration's approach to countering terrorism and its basic competence after the orders triggered chaos.\n\nIt is, for instance, arguable whether the orders cover the gravest threats to US security. Most of the attacks on US soil since 9/11 have been the work of American citizens or legal permanent residents who had no formal training by groups like ISIS or Al-Qaeda.\n\nFor example, the mass killing at a gay nightclub in Orlando last June was carried out by Omar Mateen, who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the US from Afghanistan. Foreigners who apply for permanent residency already have to undergo a rigorous screening process.\n\nTrump's executive order on immigration warned of the need to learn the lessons of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Yet the 9/11 hijackers were citizens of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon and Egypt -- nations not covered by the order.\n\nOther countries where terrorism is a simmering problem, like Pakistan, were also missing.\n\nMany terrorism experts believe the most serious threat posed by foreigners intending to conduct terrorism on US soil could come from fighters who waged war in Syria and have European Union passports and could enter America without a visa. The order does nothing to address that issue.\n\nIn practical terms, the sudden change to US policy on immigrants and refugees also provoked chaos and confusion, with airport staff uncertain about what the orders meant, and some travelers detained or refused entry to the US.\n\nIt is not clear that relevant departments of government were consulted or informed about the implications of the order or if senior administration appointees had any input into the decision. That scenario casts light on the way the White House is already imposing its power on the rest of the administration.\n\nThe result on Saturday was administrative chaos and a sense of uncertainty about what Trump's executive orders mean or how they will be implemented that is becoming a trend for the young administration.\n\n\"This was an extreme vetting program that wasn't properly vetted,\" Ohio Republican Sen.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nPresident Trump is expected to suspend the U.S. refugee program as one of his executive orders this week, closing the door on thousands of people seeking asylum from religious, political and ethnic persecution worldwide.\n\nHere's a look at what's involved with the refugee ban:\n\nWho could be affected?\n\nMost refugees in 2016 came to the U.S. from countries that are at war or under the control of repressive governments. Top refugee admissions from Africa came from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (16,370) and Somalia (9,020). From east Asia, most came from Myanmar (12,347). The greatest number of Europeans came from Ukraine (2,543), which is at war with Russian-backed irregular troops in the east. Colombians (529) fleeing an insurgency topped the list from South America, and Syrians (12,587) and Iraqis (9,880) fleeing civil war and terrorist groups topped the list from the Near East and South Asia.\n\nHow many refugees has the U.S. admitted in the past?\n\nTotal U.S. refugee admissions have dropped since 1975 from 146,158 in 1975, when 135,000 came from Asia, to 84,995 in 2016, when four out of five refugees came from Africa and the Near East or South Asia, according to the State Department.\n\nWho were the refugees from Iran?\n\nIt is uncertain how any ban on refugees from Iran will impact religious minorities from one of the world's most repressive regimes. Of the 4,152 refugees admitted from Iran in 2016, more than three-fourths, 3,252, identified as non-Muslims \u2014Bahai, Jewish, Zoroastrian or one of the Christian and Protestant faiths. According to media reports, unverified drafts of Trump's executive order that would suspend refugee applications include an exemption for religious minorities, but the drafts may change before they are signed.\n\nDoes Trump have the power to block refugees and other immigrants?\n\nYes, for security reasons. A president has the power to shut down the refugee program completely, bringing the number of refugees to zero, without any justification or approval from Congress. Federal law allows for a president to bar entry to any immigrant \u201cor any class\u201d of immigrants if the president deems them \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States, and to \"impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,\" according to the law.\n\nU.S. Code \u00a7 1182 - Inadmissible aliens: \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"\n\nHow many immigrants does the U.S. admit, and how many come from countries on Trump\u2019s list?\n\nThe State Department issued 617,752 immigrant visas and 10,891,745 non-immigrant (tourist and worker) visas in 2016. One out of 20 immigrant visas went to people from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe two major U.S. terrorist attacks that occurred in 2015 and 2016 involved people with ties to countries not on that list: Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, June 12, was a U.S.-born Afghan-American who'd traveled to Saudi Arabia in recent years. And Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the married couple who killed 14 people in San Bernadino, California, Dec. 2, 2015 also had no ties to those seven countries. Farook was born in the U.S. to Pakistani immigrants, and his wife was a recent arrival from Saudi Arabia, which Farook had visited.\n\nWould Trump block immigrants based on their religion?\n\nAccording to reports by the New York Times and Reuters, Trump is considering a month-long ban on immigrants from at least seven countries.\n\nHad Trump called the immigration ban a ban on Muslim countries, which he proposed as a temporary restriction during the presidential campaign, he would likely have faced legal challenges based on the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nBut the seven countries on his list have been carefully selected. Three of them \u2014 Iran, Sudan and Syria \u2014 comprise the State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism. The other four \u2014 Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 are designated \u201cterrorist safe havens\u201d by the State Department.\n\nTrump can point to terrorism and defend his moves based on national security grounds.\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jqtwjy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/621e4e539e558b7e3d943db07db374ba319891f4/c=0-0-7048-3982&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/01/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636209519660791028-AP-Trump-Immigration.jpg", "publishedDate": "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 12:08:16 -0500", "summary": "President Trump is expected to suspend the U.S. refugee program as one of his executive orders this week.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["affected", "trump", "countries", "refugee", "immigrants", "list", "ban", "state", "trumps", "expected", "entry", "refugees", "aliens", "came"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Patients brace for post-Obamacare out-of-pocket health costs", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/265293340/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Patients-brace-for-postObamacare-outofpocket-health-costs/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Here are the facts and figures on the Affordable Care Act and why President Trump wants to repeal and replace it.

(Photo: Family photo)\n\nScroll down to watch a USA TODAY Facebook Live panel discussion on health costs after Obamacare.\n\nA lack of clarity into what the Trump administration will do about the Affordable Care Act and drug prices is unnerving many patients with cancer and other chronic diseases, who worry that the alternative to high premiums and deductibles could lead to worse solutions than the high out-of-pocket costs they have now.\n\nAssurances that people with pre-existing health conditions will still be able to get insurance through any ACA replacement plan offers only partial solace to many cancer and heart patients. They know the details of any plan will determine whether they are better or worse off financially.\n\n\"There are a lot of important protections in the ACA that people do like,\" says Kim Thiboldeaux, CEO of the patient advocacy group Cancer Support Community. \"Suddenly you could get coverage. Even if the cost sharing was on the high side, it really felt like a relief.\"\n\nAnnual and lifetime caps on what insurers will pay for care are among the other aspects of the law that need to be maintained if not strengthened, says oncologist Clifford Hudis, CEO of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nKim Thiboldeaux is CEO of Cancer Support Community. (Photo: Cancer Support Community)\n\nThe law didn't resolve all of the challenges, Hudis says, but the impending change causes anxiety.\n\nConcerns extend beyond cancer patients.\n\nJames Harrison, 57, couldn't get insurance before the ACA because he'd had a cardiac bypass \u2014 a pre-existing condition.\n\nHe and his wife didn't buy an ACA plan the first year they were eligible, because they thought the premiums were too high, Harrison says. He's like many consumers considering buying plans before the open enrollment ends Tuesday.\n\nInstead, Harrison bought an indemnity plan that only paid up to 50% certain claims. It didn't cover the cardiac catheterization he soon needed. He was billed more than $110,000, which the hospital is suing to collect.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned, because of my pre-existing condition, that President Trump will throw me to the sharks in a high-risk pool later this year,\" says Harrison, who owns a landscaping business in Summerfield, Fla.\n\nRead more:\n\nHigh-risk insurance pools, which were one of the only options for patients with pre-existing conditions before the law, are one of the most likely ways Republicans in Congress and the White House will address soaring premiums for those on the ACA exchanges. These pools were included in the legislation introduced by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHealth care economist John Goodman, who helped draft an ACA replacement measure co-sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., is among those who believe the pools are needed to lower premiums for healthy people buying on the exchanges without financial subsidies.\n\nAdams Dudley is a pulmonologist, professor of the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Healthcare Value and a professor at the UCSF School of Medicine. (Photo: UCSF)\n\nPhysician Adams Dudley, who heads the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Healthcare Value, says the pools won't lower the overall costs of care, however. Dudley will be at USA TODAY Tuesday at noon participating in a Facebook Live panel discussion on health care costs after the law.\n\n\"There's never been a risk pool funded well enough for it to be a stable solution,\" says Dudley. \"You could put enough in risk pools and they\u2019d be fine, but there isn't a solution that's cheaper than the ACA.\"\n\nHarrison bought an ACA plan the year after he incurred the huge debt. He says his current plan has small co-pays for preventive care, but a very high deductible for non-preventive procedures. He and his wife are paying $975 a month. But he's no longer complaining about it.\n\nAs consumers pay more of the cost of their health care through higher deductibles and cost sharing, however, what that care actually costs has become more relevant.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the public think the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015. The average monthly cost for cancer drugs increased from about $5,000 to about $10,000 between 2003 and 2013, according to a 2014 oncology trend report by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. Some top $30,000 a month.\n\nTrump's vows to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid is a step in the right direction, many believe. Joseph Ross, a physician and Yale School of Medicine professor, calls drug pricing a \"huge issue that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nBut far more needs to be done: \"Until we are ready to start talking about drug value, we\u2019re negotiating around the edges,\" he says.\n\n\"Newly approved does not mean new and improved,\" says Ross. \"That\u2019s a mentality in our population.\"\n\nSend your questions and health care stories to healthinsurance@usatoday.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jPkUTR", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/901fa3d7cf1eada65faff65e0b3b1093bd1f5a75/c=0-359-959-901&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636213817127778543-JAMESHARRISON.JPG", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:47:48 -0500", "summary": "Pre-existing condition discrimination won't be allowed, but high-risk pools likely will.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["postobamacare", "cancer", "outofpocket", "preexisting", "aca", "high", "patients", "costs", "health", "plan", "harrison", "pools", "brace", "care"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump's Supreme Court nominee comes today", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/265266776/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Trumps-Supreme-Court-nominee-comes-today/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump will announce his decision for Supreme Court justice tomorrow night.

He writes with a Scalia-like flair and has degrees from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford.\n\nJudge Neil Gorsuch delivers remarks at a luncheon in Denver on Jan. 27, 2017.

He has a strong conservative record on issues affecting criminal law and the Second Amendment.\n\nThose two emerged from a list of 21 people Trump was considering, topped initially by federal appeals court judges William Pryor of Alabama and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin. But Pryor has a more controversial record on issues such as abortion and gay rights, possibly making Senate confirmation risky, and the 59-year-old Sykes projects to fewer years on the bench.\n\nTrump's nominee will face intense opposition from Senate Democrats and liberal interest groups, which already have scheduled a 9 p.m. protest at the Supreme Court to follow the announcement.\n\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Recommendations for a Supreme Court vacancy can come from a variety of places. Once confirmed, justices can serve for as long as they want. USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nRepublicans hold a 52-seat majority in the Senate, large enough to block former president Barack Obama's choice of federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland last year but not sufficient to overcome a filibuster if Democrats seek to bottle up the nomination as revenge for what many consider a stolen Supreme Court seat. Unless Trump can win over eight of them, Republicans will have to change the Senate's rules, eliminating the 60-vote threshold needed to bring the nomination to the floor. Trump endorsed such a move last week.\n\nThomas Hardiman sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. (Photo: Cliff Owen, AP)\n\nThe White House is hoping to have the seat filled in time for the court's April sitting, the last of the 2016 term, when several cases could be considered involving such issues as religious liberty and transgender rights. That likely was one reason for announcing the nomination two days earlier than initially planned.\n\nConservative interest groups were preparing the initial phase of what they said would be a $10 million advertising campaign on behalf of the nominee. The first ads will go up in four states that Trump won decisively in November where Democratic senators face tough re-election battles: Indiana, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nReplacing Scalia will not shift the court ideologically from where it was a year ago, but it will put conservatives one seat short of a commanding majority. With the seat filled, the longest-serving justice, Anthony Kennedy, once again will be the man in the middle \u2014 siding with conservatives in most cases but occasionally with liberals on issues such as abortion, affirmative action and gay rights.\n\nStill, Democrats understand demographics: Kennedy, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988, is 80 years old and considering retirement. President Bill Clinton's two justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are 83 and 78, respectively. One or more retirements would give Trump an opportunity to shift the court to the right, possibly for generations to come.\n\nFor that reason, some Democrats have said recently that they should consider Scalia's replacement on his or her merits and save their more vehement opposition for the next nomination fight, if it comes during Trump's presidency.\n\nRead more:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jP5bnF", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/99c722bf4e0e77e03aef80d011c7249f63c25457/c=0-168-3000-1863&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636214628041045013-GTY-633165138.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:39:49 -0500", "summary": "Will it be Scalia acolyte Neil Gorsuch or gun rights advocate Thomas Hardiman?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["supreme", "appeals", "court", "trump", "nominee", "skip", "issues", "seat", "comes", "trumps", "x", "president", "nomination", "today"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Labor secretary nominee's hearing on hold again", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/265419586/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Labor-secretary-nominees-hearing-on-hold-again/", "text": "Andrew Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, exits after his meeting at Trump International Golf Club on Nov. 19, 2016 in Bedminster Township, N.J.

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. testifies on Capitol Hill during his confirmation hearing on Jan. 10, 2017. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A politically divided Senate Judiciary Committee clashed Tuesday over the nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 nomination as attorney general, even as President Trump\u2019s abrupt dismissal of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates shadowed the heated debate over whether the nominee could distance himself from the president he worked hard to elect.\n\nThe debate, a prelude to an expected committee vote Wednesday on the nomination, came less than 24 hours after the president dismissed Yates when she refused to defend his controversial refugee ban in federal court.\n\nIn raised voices Democratic panel members called on their colleagues to reject Sessions, casting serious doubt on the senator\u2019s independence from the White House and the president now in the midst of defending the new administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policy measures that Sessions long helped to shape.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw last night is an example of what is at stake with this nomination,\u2019\u2019 Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, referring to Yates\u2019 firing. \u201cThere is something looming over this nomination.\u2019\u2019\n\nLeahy\u2019s fierce criticism of a longtime Senate colleague followed California Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s repudiation of Sessions', suggesting that the nominee was \u201can arm of the White House\u2019\u2019 and would carry out the president's ''destructive\u2019\u2019 policy agenda.\n\nThe panel\u2019s ranking Democrat cited Yates' firing, saying that the acting attorney general demonstrated the \"guts'' necessary for the job by refusing to defend Trump's order.\n\n\"I have no confidence Sen. Sessions will do that,'' Feinstein said. \u201cI must vote no.\u2019\u2019\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, rallied to support the nominee, dismissing allegations that the longtime Alabama senator had helped author the president\u2019s executive order that suspends immigration from seven majority Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cSome on the other side have raised concerns about whether Sen. Sessions was involved in drafting or reviewing the executive orders,'' Grassley said. \"It\u2019s not clear to me why it would be a problem even if he had been involved. But the fact of the matter is he wasn\u2019t. In his written responses to Sen. Leahy, Sen. Sessions stated for the record 'neither I, nor any of my current staff' had a role in formulating or drafting the executive orders.\n\nGrassley said Sessions had \u201cassured us that he will enforce the laws fully, fairly, and independently.\u2019\u2019\n\n\"These answers, combined with his life of public service and his experience working with each of us, assure me that Senator Sessions will make an outstanding attorney general.''\n\nOn Monday, Politico reported that the order was drafted by staff members of the House Judiciary Committee, who did not tell their superiors that they had worked on the order.\n\nThe ouster of Yates, an Obama administration appointee who was directing the department during the Trump administration transition, came after she notified Justice lawyers that she was \u201cnot convinced\u201d that Trump\u2019s executive order suspending immigration from seven majority Muslim countries was lawful.\n\n\"Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,\" said a statement from the White House that appeared to be in Trump's own voice. It was Trump, however, who allowed Yates to serve as acting attorney general.\n\nTrump appointed Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as acting attorney general until Sessions can be confirmed. If the Senate Judiciary Committee votes to approve the nominee, a full Senate vote was expected by week\u2019s end.\n\nBoente was immediately sworn in at 9 p.m. Monday, and he quickly moved to rescind Yates\u2019 notice to Justice lawyers.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u201cI will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,\u201d Boente said in a statement issued through the White House.\n\nBoente was at the Justice Department Tuesday, working out of the office suite that Yates had occupied hours before. A Justice official said that Yates cleared her office after her dismissal and left the department about 11 p.m.\n\nThe stunning series of events that rolled late into Monday evening drew immediate comparisons to the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of Oct. 20, 1973, when then Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy, William Ruckelshaus, chose to resign rather than obey President Nixon\u2019s order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.\n\nYates was deputy attorney general under President Obama and has been serving as acting attorney general since Loretta Lynch resigned on Inauguration Day. She had refused to defend his executive order, which has been challenged in court by civil liberties groups who argue it discriminates on the basis of religion.\n\nSally Yates speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 28, 2016. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\u201d said Yates in a letter to Justice Department attorneys. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.\n\n\u201cConsequently, for as long as I am the acting attorney general, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,\" wrote Yates.\n\nTrump first responded to Yates via Twitter, characterizing the action as a \"political\" move to block his agenda.\n\n\"Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons,'' Trump tweeted. \"They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.\"\n\nThe Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017\n\nSenate Democrats have objected to Sessions\u2019 nomination, and Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday that Sessions should have to disclose his opinion of Trump\u2019s immigration order before the Senate votes on his nomination.\n\nTrump adviser Stephen Miller told MSNBC on Monday that Yates' decision is \u201ca further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become,\u201d so much so that \u201cyou have people refusing to enforce our laws.\u201d Miller said the president clearly has the legal authority to bar people from entry into the country for national security reasons.\n\nBut former Obama attorney general Eric Holder tweeted late Monday that Yates' \"judgement should be trusted.\"\n\nTrump's executive order had been reviewed and approved by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel before it was issued Friday \u2014 a point that White House press secretary Sean Spicer was quick to point out Monday night.\n\nBut Yates said the OLC's role was only to address the form of the order and whether it's is properly drafted. It \u201cdid not address whether any policy choice embodied in an executive order is wise or just,\u201d Yates wrote. \u201cMy responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe executive order contains an exception for religious minorities from the banned countries, which are Iraq, Iran, Syria. Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an interview that aired Sunday that the intent was to protect Christian refugees.\n\nYates\u2019 firing extended a chaotic weekend where lawyers flooded courtrooms around the country to try and halt the deportation of people who had arrived after Trump signed his executive order. A federal judge in New York issued an emergency, nationwide stay late Saturday barring the federal government from any more deportations.\n\nImmigration advocacy groups have started filing broader lawsuits challenging the overall legality of Trump\u2019s order.\n\nA group of Michigan immigrants filed a suit in federal court in Virginia on Monday challenging the order on religious grounds. That suit claims Trump\u2019s order discriminates against Muslims and violates constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion.\n\nA separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle on Monday claims that Trump\u2019s order violates a federal law that prohibits discrimination against immigrants based on their country of origin. That lawsuit was filed on behalf of U.S.-based parents trying to reunite with their children in Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nMatt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and one of the attorneys in the suit, acknowledged that a president had broad powers to oversee the nation\u2019s immigration system. Federal law allows a president to bar entry to any immigrant, or entire classes of immigrants, if the president deems them \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the lawsuit claims that Trump overstepped his legal authority by temporarily suspending all immigration from seven entire countries. It points to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which forbids discrimination based on a person\u2019s nationality or country of origin.\n\n\u201cWhile the president has certain powers, he doesn\u2019t have power to defy this clause,\u201d Adams said.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have offered legislation to overturn Trump's order, but they have not gathered any Republican support. Democrats staged a protest on the steps of the Supreme Court on Monday evening to rail against the executive order.\n\nTrump criticized Democrats in a series of tweets Tuesday morning, saying they were holding up Sessions' nomination for political reasons.\n\nRead more:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jPHeMV", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1fe435091769fab74126923e121046e03ed455da/c=0-129-4241-2525&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636214456219983603-AP-Trump-Attorney-General.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 13:57:24 -0500", "summary": "Interim Justice leadership in turmoil after Trump fires acting AG.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["doj", "attorney", "trump", "sessions", "senate", "executive", "chaos", "general", "order", "justice", "department", "trumps", "faces", "vote", "president", "yates", "throws"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump to keep Obama executive order for LGBTQ workplace protections", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/265314334/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Trump-to-keep-Obama-executive-order-for-LGBTQ-workplace-protections/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Former President Barack Obama prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against LGBTQ employees in 2014.

Joe Heck, a physician who reached the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army Reserve.\n\nOutside groups poured more than $90 million into the race, and top officials from both parties were frequent visitors.\n\nCortez Masto will be expected to be a solid Democratic vote in the Senate and be supportive of party leadership.\n\n\u2014 Bill Theobald\n\nTammy Duckworth Illinois Democrat\n\nDemocrat Tammy Duckworth easily defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Mark Kirk in one of the least surprising Senate victories this year.\n\nShe had led by double digits in recent polls, and a majority of Illinois voters in one recent survey said they thought Kirk hadn\u2019t recovered enough from a stroke he suffered in 2012 to perform his Senate duties.\n\nTammy Duckworth celebrates her win over incumbent Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., on Nov. 8, 2016, in Chicago.\n\n(Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP)\n\nDuckworth is a two-term congresswoman and veteran who lost both legs when the helicopter she was riding in was shot down in Iraq in 2004.\n\nAfter a yearlong recovery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, she went on to serve stints as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs and as an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs. On Capitol Hill, Duckworth has made veterans issues a priority, and she helped pass legislation to provide resources to prevent veteran suicide, among other initiatives.\n\nDuring the Senate campaign, she said she would back working with Russia to establish a no-fly zone in Syria and putting more pressure on NATO allies, including Turkey, to help oust the Syrian regime. Duckworth also said public-private partnerships should be leveraged to provide tuition-free community college vocational training, which would be a first step toward free community college for all. She also backs increased investment in infrastructure.\n\n\u2014 Donovan Slack\n\nKamala Harris California Democrat\n\nCalifornia\u2019s next senator was the front-runner from the day in January 2015 she announced her candidacy, saying she would be \u201ca fighter for the next generation.\u201d In a sense, at age 52, Kamala Harris is getting the first opportunity of anyone in her own generation to win a Senate seat in California.\n\nBarbara Boxer, 75, who announced last year she wouldn\u2019t be seeking a fifth term, was first elected to the Senate in 1992 replacing the late Alan Cranston, who was resigning after four terms. Dianne Feinstein, 83, was elected the same year to finish out the term of Pete Wilson, who had been elected governor, and has remained in the Senate ever since.\n\nKamala Harris greets supporters at a election night rally on Nov. 8, 2016 in Los Angeles.\n\n(Photo: Chris Carlson, AP)\n\nHarris, a career prosecuting attorney before being elected and re-elected as the state\u2019s attorney general, will be the first African American and Indian American to represent the Golden State in the Senate. She defeated 10-term Rep. Loretta Sanchez in the Democrat-vs-Democrat general election. Her path to the seat was not as steep as once predicted, as former and current Los Angeles mayors Antonio Villaraigosa and Eric Garcetti, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer decided not to run.\n\nAs attorney general she is perhaps best known for negotiating the settlement with bankers over illegal mortgage practices that brought billions to underwater California homeowners. She is also known as an expert on tackling recidivism \u2014 she wrote a book, Smart on Crime, about it \u2014 and making parents responsible for truant children. As district attorney of San Francisco city and county, she was known for antagonizing local police when she declined to seek the death penalty for a cop killer in 2004, her first year in office.\n\nHarris is also known to have a good relationship with departing President Obama, who once described her as \u201cby far the best-looking attorney general in the country.\u201d\n\nUnlike the outspoken Boxer she\u2019s replacing, Harris has been called cautious. Asked at the only general election debate last month what committee assignments she\u2019ll seek, for example, she said she was concentrating on the election and wouldn\u2019t look beyond it.\n\n\u2014Bartholomew Sullivan\n\nMaggie Hassan New Hampshire Democrat\n\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan eked out a win to unseat incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte in one of the tightest races in the country.\n\nHassan, 58, has been governor of New Hampshire since 2013, and before that, she was a state senator for six years, including a stint as majority leader before losing re-election in 2010.\n\nMaggie Hassan waves to supporters during an election night rally in Manchester, N.H., on Nov. 9, 2016.\n\n(Photo: Charles Krupa, AP)\n\nDuring her tenure as governor, Hassan maintained high job approval ratings, with a Morning Consult poll earlier this year gauging her support 56% favorable and only 33% unfavorable.\n\nShe campaigned for Senate on a pledge to work across the aisle to make Washington work better for middle-class Americans and touted her prior record in New Hampshire, where she froze tuition at state universities and lowered it at community colleges and passed two budgets without raising sales or income taxes.\n\nA lawyer by trade, Hassan started in public service as an advocate for special-needs children after the eldest of her two children, Ben, now 28, was born with cerebral palsy. Her campaign said she was driven to \u201censure that children like her son Ben, who experiences severe disabilities, would be fully included in their communities and have the same opportunities that all parents want for their children.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Donovan Slack\n\nJohn Kennedy Louisiana Republican\n\nLouisiana Republican John Kennedy pulled off a win on Dec. 10 in the last Senate race of 2016.\n\nKennedy, the state treasurer, defeated Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell in a runoff to become the latest soon-to-be-member of the Senate.\n\nKennedy, a former Democrat, had unsuccessfully run twice for the Senate seat. He beat Campbell 63% to 37%.\n\nJohn Kennedy delivers a victory speech during an election party on Dec. 10, 2016, in Baton Rouge, La.\n\n(Photo: Jonathan Bachman, Getty Images)\n\nThe race had garnered national attention with its unprecedented field of 24 candidates, including former Ku Klu Klan leader David Duke. It also attracted attention when Republican powerhouses came in to help Kennedy in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, traveled to the Pelican State to stump for Kennedy the week before the runoff. Kennedy had supported Trump, who easily won the state.\n\nCampbell, meanwhile, didn\u2019t get much help from national Democrats. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who is popular in the state, endorsed Campbell early in the campaign, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nCampbell had hoped to take advantage of Edwards\u2019 upset in 2015 when he defeated Republican Sen. David Vitter in the red state.\n\nKennedy ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2004 (as a Democrat) and in 2008 (as a Republican), but he entered the race as a favorite because of his statewide name recognition. Kennedy had won five statewide races and had years of political experience, including a stint as special counsel to former Republican governor Buddy Roemer.\n\nDuring the campaign Kennedy, a fiscal conservative, took aim at the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature issue. Obama is unpopular in the state.\n\n\u201cI want my country back. I\u2019m scared we are losing it,\u201d Kennedy said when he announced his bid to run. \u201cI worry that America is losing those (conservative) values.\u201d\n\nKennedy was the front-runner leading up to the runoff. He had nabbed 25% of the vote in the Nov. 8 election, while Foster came in second with 17%. In Louisiana, the top two candidates go to a runoff if the winner of the general election does not reach 50% of the vote.\n\n\u2014 Deborah Barfield Berry and Greg Hilburn.\n\nChris Van Hollen Maryland Democrat\n\nSooner or later, Chris Van Hollen was going to be a U.S. senator.\n\nThe six-term congressman from Maryland literally grew up in government. Van Hollen was born in Pakistan, where his father was serving in the foreign service, and lived in several foreign outposts as a child. His father ultimately served as U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Van Hollen did his graduate studies at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he met his wife, Katherine, and they both wound up with jobs on Capitol Hill.\n\nChris Van Hollen speaks to supporters in Silver Spring, Md., after his Senate victory on Nov. 8, 2016.\n\n(Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP)\n\nVan Hollen's first gig was working for Maryland's legendary Sen. Charles \"Mac\" Mathias, a famously moderate Republican.\n\nFirst elected to Congress on his own in 2002, Van Hollen quickly moved up the ladder of leadership among House Democrats. He led the Democrats' House campaign operation for the 2008 and 2010 election cycles, getting a good reputation among his colleagues for being a prodigious fundraiser. The 2006 Almanac of American Politics said Van Hollen, then still in his second House term, is \"among the many Democrats in the Maryland delegation interested in running for a Senate seat when one comes open.\" He took a pass on the 2006 race won by Democrat Ben Cardin, but the retirement this year of 30-year veteran Sen. Barbara Mikulski was likely to be his last shot for a long while.\n\nThe major hurdle to his promotion this year was a tough primary battle against Rep. Donna Edwards, a more liberal African-American lawmaker who argued that Van Hollen would be too cozy with Wall Street. The race seemed close at first, but Van Hollen ultimately won by a better than 10% margin.\n\nIn the general election he had little trouble dispatching his Republican opponent, delegate Kathy Szeliga, in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\n\u2014 Paul Singer\n\nTodd Young Indiana Republican\n\nRepublican Todd Young, a former Marine who mentioned that fact in nearly every campaign conversation, won Indiana\u2019s open Senate seat by defeating one of the most formidable Indiana politicians: Evan Bayh.\n\nIt was not the race Young had expected.\n\nTodd Young, accompanied by his wife, Jenny, celebrates winning his Senate race on Nov. 8, 2016, in Indianapolis.\n\n(Photo: Michael Conroy, AP)\n\nAfter his decisive May primary win over a Tea Party-backed opponent, Young was set to face former congressman Baron Hill, the Democrat he defeated in a 2010 House race.\n\nBut Hill withdrew from the race in July, clearing the way for Bayh \u2014 a former U.S. senator with more than $9 million in leftover campaign funds \u2014 to go after the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats.\n\nRepublican leadership and outside groups \u2013 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2013 came to Young\u2019s aid as they had in the primary.\n\nThe election became a referendum on Bayh. Young and his allies accused Bayh of leaving Indiana behind and cashing in when, instead of seeking re-election in 2010 after voting for the Affordable Care Act, Bayh went to work for a Washington law and lobbying firm and for a private equity fund.\n\nThe attacks steadily eroded the good feelings Hoosiers had of Bayh from his two terms as senator and governor, even as Young remained unknown to many voters.\n\nIn the House, Young had been among the minority of Republicans who joined Democrats in voting for a deal to end the 2013 partial government shutdown.\n\nHis willingness to cast tough votes helped him win a seat on the influential Ways and Means Committee, where he threw himself into overhauling the tax code and exploring a new way of funding social services programs.\n\nYoung said he hopes in the Senate to be known as one of the \u201cgo-to experts\u201d on helping the poor and vulnerable.\n\nYoung\u2019s political experience before running for Congress included stints with the conservative Heritage Foundation and working on energy policy for then-senator Richard Lugar.\n\nWhile Young, 44, did not grow up in a politically active home, his wife is the niece of former vice president Dan Quayle \u2014 who ended Bayh\u2019s father\u2019s Senate career in 1980.\n\nYoung has slept in his Capitol Hill office in recent years while keeping his home in Bloomington with his wife, Jenny, and their four children.\n\n\u2014 Maureen Groppe", "image":

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017\n\nThe furor over Trump's travel order comes as he prepares to make a major a legal announcement Tuesday night: a Supreme Court nomination.\n\nDemocrats blasted Trump's dismissal of Yates and pledged to make it and the new Trump order a part of the debate over Sessions' nomination.\n\n\u201cThe firing of Sally Yates underscores how important it is to have an Attorney General who will stand up to the White House when they are violating the law,\" said Schumer, who has choked up while discussing the impact of Trump's travel ban. \"Many people have doubts about whether Jeff Sessions can be that person.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nRepublicans, however, have 52 of the 100 Senate seats, and Sessions is a favorite for confirmation.\n\nSchumer has choked up during his comments about the immigration order, something Trump mocked in his early morning tweets.\n\nWhile Schumer described the Yates dismissal as a \"Monday Night Massacre,\" the White House said Trump was well within his rights and that Yates \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\"\n\nIn a statement, the White House said that \"Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\"\n\nTrump aides also continued to defend the order, saying it is designed to stop potential terrorists who might try to infiltrate the country. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said \"this is not a travel ban,\" but rather \"a temporary pause that allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa vetting.\"\n\nMany Republicans applauded Trump's moves.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, said Trump has the right to use his television catch phrase \u2014 \"you're fired\" \u2014 if there are disagreements. \"That's the only way we're going to get things cleaned up, and get political hacks out,\" he told Fox & Friends.\n\nLegal analysts such as Jack Goldsmith \u2014 a Harvard Law School professor and Justice Department official during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 said Yates should have resigned rather than force Trump's hand.\n\nThis very issue came up during Yates' confirmation hearing in 2015 \u2014 upon questions from Sessions himself.\n\n\u201cIf the views the president wants to execute is unlawful, should the attorney general or deputy attorney general say no?\u201d Sessions asked Yates back then.\n\nHer reply: \u201cSenator, I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has the obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jPJP9F", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b85a935d0fb0982ab8158361207445e6bf44f7eb/c=0-54-3205-1865&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636214425214721431-AP-TRUMP-CHICAGO-88284854.JPG", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 12:29:01 -0500", "summary": "President demands that Senate confirm attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["attorney", "trump", "sessions", "senate", "travel", "yates", "immigration", "defiant", "general", "democrats", "mocks", "order", "supreme", "trumps"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Senate Democrats block two Trump Cabinet picks by boycotting vote", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/265388552/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Senate-Democrats-block-two-Trump-Cabinet-picks-by-boycotting-vote/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Senate Democrats are doing everything they can to prevent two of President Trump's cabinet picks.

Maybe Trump will be impeached in May. #HistoryRepeating#Pray \u2014 Christian Democrats (@ChristianDems) January 31, 2017\n\nNot everyone blasted Trump's decision to fire Yates. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich applauded Trump for taking action. Ted Cruz, a bitter opponent of Trump's in the GOP presidential primaries, said, \"President Trump was exactly right to fire an acting Attorney General who refused to carry out her constitutional duty to enforce and defend the law.\"\n\nPresidents and their attorneys general have clashed time and time again. Attorney General John Ashcroft almost resigned after two White House officials tried to push him to approve former President George W. Bush's secret wiretapping program \u2014all while in the hospital for pancreatis, according to Salon. But Yates' is the first public ouster of an attorney general since the Nixon-era. Enter the Internet drawing parallels between Yates and Richardson, two attorney generals who left their post after refusing to follow the president's orders.\n\n\"Clashes between presidents and attorney generals aren't unprecedented, but neither are they common,\" said Sean P. Cunningham, a history professor at Texas Tech University.\n\nHe didn't compare Yates' firing to the Saturday Night Massacre on Oct. 20, 1973, but he pointed out that it was the most famous example of a federal government shakeup.\n\nWhat is the Saturday Night Massacre?\n\nThe Saturday Night Massacre was one of several key developments in the investigation into the Watergate scandal, which led to Nixon's resignation. At the time, The Washington Post called the resignations \"the most traumatic government upheaval of the Watergate crisis.\"\n\nRichardson, who had previously served as secretary of Education and secretary of Defense, became attorney general in April 1973. Six months into the job, Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor on the federal Watergate investigation. Why? Because Cox had subpoenaed tapes of key White House conversations and refused to comply with Nixon's workaround: an agreement with the Senate Watergate committee that Cox could get summaries of relevant tapes and documents.\n\nNot only that. Earlier that day, Cox spoke out about the agreement in a news conference and publicly vowed to press for the tapes, the Post reported.\n\nRichardson refused to fire him. He resigned. So did his deputy, Ruckelshaus.\n\nSolicitor General Robert H. Bork, serving as acting attorney general in their absence, fired Cox. The president shut down the office of the special prosecutor that night, turning over the Watergate investigation to the Justice Department.\n\n\"One of the important takeaways is that Nixon's efforts to control the attorney general and control the Watergate narrative, backfired badly,\" Cunningham said. \"By that point, most Americans already distrusted Nixon, but Nixon's aggressive actions dramatically eroded the public's already fading trust in the presidency.\"\n\nEventually, investigators obtained the tapes and Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal came to light. Facing the prospect of impeachment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 8, 1974.\n\nWhy are people comparing Yates' firing to the 'massacre?'\n\nCritics are drawing parallels between the Saturday Night Massacre and Yates' firing because they see a dissident defying a president (as Cox, Richardson and Ruckelshaus did) resulting in them leaving their posts. Nixon's shakeup came as he was trying to hide his role in the Watergate scandal, which was illegal. Trump's came as he was trying to enforce an immigration order he signed Friday. While Trump says the order is meant to protect Americans from terrorists abroad, the order's constitutionality likely will be challenged in court on the basis that it discriminates against Muslims and violates protections to exercise freedom of religion.\n\nIn an op-ed for CNN, historian Julian Zelizer, drew parallels between Yates' firing and the Watergate moment, called the firing the \"Monday Night Massacre.\" Senate Democrats, he said, should see the latest events as a wake-up call.\n\n\"In his nominations, Trump has put forth people who likely will be mostly yes men and who will interact with a sympathetic and protective Republican Congress,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps, Senate Democrats will see Monday night's events at the Justice Department as a wake-up call to slow down the confirmation of Senator Sessions before there is no one left around to place some restraints on the Trump presidency.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jQivpt", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/677257e96966532628ad6759c35ac30245555950/c=0-217-4777-2916&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/03/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635941757399723140-AP-JUSTICE-DEPARTMENT-MANDATORY-MINIMUMS-80680382.JPG", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 11:41:39 -0500", "summary": "Some critics compared the firing to a Nixon-era shakeup in which the attorney general resigned.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["night", "attorney", "firing", "watergate", "trump", "yates", "massacre", "general", "trumps", "resembles", "president", "nixons", "sally"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Trump pledges fewer regulations, more competition for drugmakers", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/265379176/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Trump-pledges-fewer-regulations-more-competition-for-drugmakers/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Donald Trump says he wants to lower drug prices and bring pharmaceutical companies back to the United States.

Trump said he will name his pick Tuesday.\n\nBut they also balanced their optimism about the election results with concerns about policies advanced by new president on free trade and immigration.\n\nOn Sunday, Koch officials delivered their first public criticism of Trump\u2019s administration, slamming his order banning visitors from seven largely Muslim countries. They also criticized House Republican leaders for supporting a border tax, which they say will drive up costs for consumers.\n\n\u201cBuy America is not a good thing for American citizens,\u201d said Chris Rufer, a California tomato processor and a longtime network financier. \u201cIt will increase the cost of goods and services.\u201d\n\nBut other conservative donors said they welcomed Trump\u2019s swift action in the first week of his presidency.

USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nAlberto Abin walks out of the UniVista Insurance company office after shopping for a health plan under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, on December 15, 2015 in Miami, Florida. (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images)\n\nThe final deadline to buy a 2017 Affordable Care Act plan is Tuesday night at midnight.\n\nIt would be easy to lose sight of why health insurance is really important after all the bad press the law has gotten. Yes, premiums have soared in many parts of the country. And deductibles and consumers' cost sharing are going nowhere but up.\n\nIt's even unclear whether the Trump Administration will enforce the penalties against people who were uninsured in the previous year when tax time comes along.\n\n5 reasons it makes sense to buy a plan:\n\n1. Plans stay in effect through year. Even if you're an opponent of the law, it's still the law of the land and the plans being sold have to meet it at least through this year. It's a contract between insurers and consumers \u2014 not with Congress or the White House.\n\n2. Out of pocket maximums. There are caps on how much you'll have to pay during the year and your lifetime \u2014 not the other way around as it was before the ACA. Back then, insurers could decide how much they would pay in total for you. This greatly reduces (even if it doesn't eliminate) the chance hospital bills will bankrupt your family if you get sick.\n\n3. Prevention not a bad word. You don't have to like former President Obama or his signature health law to appreciate fully-covered physicals, colonoscopies and birth control.\n\n4. Essential health benefits. ACA critics, including consumers frustrated by their high premiums, often note they don't need maternity coverage at their age or any of the many other benefits required in the law. But who among us isn't feeling a tad more stressed these days? That required mental health coverage could come in real handy by the end of the year.\n\n5. Drug prices hardly decreasing. You may not like your co-payment on that pricey drug, but imagine paying the whole price in cash. Besides, drug companies are rather generous with co-pay assistance, but only if you're insured. You may be completely out of luck if you're not.\n\nIf you're still on the fence ...\n\nJames Harrison, 57, of Summerfield, Fla., didn't buy an ACA plan for 2014 because he thought he and his wife could pay out of pocket for any health expenses above the 50% their non-ACA indemnity plan covered of some procedures. Then he needed a cardiac catheterization and his plan wouldn't cover at all. Now, he's being sued for more than $110,000 by the hospital that did the procedure.\n\nInsurance is protection against the unknown, like \"the heart attack you didn't see coming,\" says Adams Dudley, a physician who heads the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Healthcare Value. The \"vast majority\" of people can't handle a new $50,000 expense, or often one that is a fraction of that, he adds.\n\n\"Most of the people who have opioid addiction did not think they ever would,\" says Dudley. \"Everybody will eventually have one of those things, but we don\u2019t know which ones.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jR5qMm", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33806193ab6824929f8adc30a67ef9ac8227f48c/c=0-0-2995-1692&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636191419442129952-GTY-501447638.jpg", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 09:13:28 -0500", "summary": "All the talk of repeal, replace and no penalties doesn't mean you don't need coverage.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["enroll", "buy", "dont", "consumers", "reasons", "pay", "youre", "obamacare", "drug", "sign", "health", "plan", "law", "day", "care"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Sessions questioned Yates' willingness to defy president", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2017/01/31/sessions-questioned-yates'-willingness-defy-president/97276610/", "text": "During a 2015 confirmation hearing for then-deputy attorney general nominee Sally Yates, Sen.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House surrounded by small business leaders Monday. (Photo: Pool, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has begun his presidency with an unprecedented blizzard of executive action, signing more presidential directives than any president in modern history.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump criticized President Obama's \"illegal and overreaching executive orders.\" Now, he's using those same orders in ways previous presidents have not.\n\nHe has used them to order the approval of permits to specific private companies (the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines). He has not only reinstated Reagan-era policies but expanded them \u2014 as with the ban on federal funding to global health groups that promote abortion. On Monday, he tightened the White House's grip on the regulatory process, insisting that agencies stick to a quota of regulations approved by the president as part of the annual budgeting process.\n\nAnd he has even created a new form of executive order called a National Security Presidential Memorandum and used it to give orders to the Pentagon and give his political strategist a seat at the table in National Security Council meetings.\n\nWhile Trump has signed fewer executive orders than Obama at this point in his presidency, he has signed more presidential memoranda \u2014 a kind of first cousin to executive orders that became Obama's tool of choice as he tried to get around a Republican Congress.\n\nTrump's party has control of Congress. He's just impatient.\n\nTrump appears to be trying to make good on every campaign promise at once, which in itself was one of his campaign promises. In speeches last fall, he promised to \"cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama\" on his very first day in office. (He didn't.)\n\n\"It\u2019s not unusual for a president to hit the ground running and issue a lot of unilateral directives early in his term,\" says William Howell, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. \"But to see him swinging for the fences \u2014 he's just letting it rip on all manner of policy issues \u2014 is striking.\"\n\nEscalating pattern\n\nPresidential scholars say Trump's executive orders have followed an escalating pattern after a change of party: Republican presidents rescind Democratic policies and reinstate those of the last Republican president. Democratic presidents do the same with Republican policies.\n\nThe Day One executive order on the Affordable Care Act, for example, was a one-page directive telling federal agencies to allow more flexibility in enforcing the provisions of Obamacare until Congress can repeal it. But the order contained the phrase \"to the maximum extent permitted by law,\" three times, suggesting that its effects are yet to be determined.\n\nOne of the most noticeable differences is in style: While Obama signed most of his executive orders in private, Trump has signed all of his in public, with a headline-generating photo opportunities intended to convey constant presidential action.\n\n\"Executive orders are generally used to enact public policies, but some of Trump\u2019s orders seem to have been for more symbolic or rhetorical purposes,\" says Graham Dodds, a political scientist at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\nAnd that seems to be part of the strategy. \"We've hit the ground running at a record pace,\" he boasted in his weekly radio address Saturday.\n\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS Trump replaces acting Director of Immigration Enforcement | 1:17 In the wake of his controversial immigration ban, President Donald Trump sending a clear message, get in line or get out of the way.

Aboard Air Force One last Thursday, press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump would order an investigation into his spurious claims of widespread voter fraud. That order never came.\n\nExecutive orders are also a way to keep control of the narrative. \"Bill Clinton did something similar during his impeachment where he issued a bunch of executive orders to do things Congress likely would have done anyway,\" says Chad Murphy, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. \"But he wanted to show he was busy doing the people's work while Congress was wasting four years and $40 million investigating his sex life.\"\n\nThe pace of action has prompted questions about how much agency lawyers have been involved in the drafting of executive orders, which has been standard practice under previous presidents. The order on refugee admissions, for example, appeared to include permanent legal residents \u2014 \"green card\" holders \u2014 despite later clarifications from the White House that it wasn't the president's intent.\n\nTrump's orders also show that presidential directives have become political weapons as much as they are policy and management tools, with partisan outrage depending on which president was wielding the pen.\n\nDuring Obama's presidency, Trump often criticized what he called \"overreaching\" executive orders. \"Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?\" he tweeted as early as 2012.\n\n\"The conservatives who criticized Bill Clinton's orders were largely silent for George W. Bush's orders, then loudly complained about Barack Obama's orders, and now are mostly silent about Donald Trump's orders,\" Dodds says.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jP5V9H", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64be9f45eaab7f1d50f953b67920fcc26bf7c803/c=0-0-3994-2256&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/01/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636213917778154612-GTY-633089772-88432512.JPG", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 08:31:32 -0500", "summary": "The president has begun his term with a blizzard of executive action.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["different", "faster", "33", "skip", "executive", "share", "days", "actions", "forms", "trumps", "x", "president", "embed", "come", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"title": "America's corporate giants push back against Trump's immigration ban", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2017/01/31/america's-corporate-giants-push-back-against-trump's-immigration-ban/97235286/", "text": "The leaders of several major U.S. corporations have denounced President Trump's ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Jeff Sessions, can be confirmed by the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a Tuesday vote on Sessions, who has closely advised Trump on immigration matters.\n\nBoente was immediately sworn in at 9 p.m. Monday. \"I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,\u201d Boente said in a statement issued through the White House.\n\nThe stunning series of events that rolled late into Monday evening drew immediate comparisons to the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when then Attorney General Elliot Richardson chose to resign rather than obey President Nixon\u2019s order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.\n\nYates was deputy attorney general under President Obama and has been serving as acting acting attorney general since Loretta Lynch resigned on Inauguration Day. She had refused to defend his executive order, which has been challenged in court by civil liberties groups who argue it discriminates on the basis of religion.\n\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share With emotions running high in the wake of President Trump's executive order on immigration, let's take a look at some of the numbers involved. Buzz60\n\n\u201cI am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\u201d said Yates in a letter to Justice Department attorneys. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.\n\n\u201cConsequently, for as long as I am the acting attorney general, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,\" wrote Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration.\n\nTrump responded to Yates via Twitter, characterizing the action as a \"political\" move to block his agenda.\n\n\"Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons,'' Trump tweeted. \"They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.\"\n\nSenate Democrats have objected to Sessions\u2019 nomination, and Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday on CNN that Sessions should have to disclose his opinion of Trump\u2019s immigration order before the Senate votes on his nomination.\n\nTrump advisor Stephen Miller told MSNBC Monday that Yates' decision is \u201ca further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become,\u201d so much so that \u201cyou have people refusing to enforce our laws.\u201d Miller said the president clearly has the legal authority to bar people from entry into the country for national security reasons.\n\nBut former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted late Monday that Yates' \"judgement should be trusted.\"\n\nSally Yates: person of integrity/attorney with great legal skill. Has served this nation with distinction. Her judgment should be trusted. \u2014 Eric Holder (@EricHolder) January 31, 2017\n\nTrump's executive order had been reviewed and approved by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel before it was issued Friday \u2014 a point that White House press secretary Sean Spicer was quick to point out Monday night.\n\nBut Yates said the OLC's role was only to address the form of the order and whether it's is properly drafted. It \u201cdid not address whether any policy choice embodied in an executive order is wise or just,\u201d Yates wrote. \u201cMy responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts.\u201d\n\nThe executive order contains an exception for religious minorities from the banned countries, which are Iraq, Iran, Syria. Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an interview that aired Sunday that the intent was to protect Christian refugees.\n\nYates\u2019 order followed a chaotic weekend where lawyers flooded courtrooms around the country to try and halt the deportation of people who had arrived after Trump signed his executive order. A federal judge in New York issued an emergency, nationwide stay late Saturday barring the federal government from any more deportations.\n\nImmigration advocacy groups have started filing broader lawsuits challenging the overall legality of Trump\u2019s order.\n\nA group of Michigan immigrants filed a suit in federal court in Virginia on Monday challenging the order on religious grounds. That suit claims Trump\u2019s order discriminates against Muslims and violates constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion.\n\nA separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle on Monday claims that Trump\u2019s order violates a federal law that prohibits discrimination against immigrants based on their country of origin. That lawsuit was filed on behalf of U.S.-based parents trying to reunite with their children in Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nMatt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and one of the attorneys in the suit, acknowledged that a president had broad powers to oversee the nation\u2019s immigration system. Federal law allows a president to bar entry to any immigrant, or entire classes of immigrants, if the president deems them \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the lawsuit claims that Trump overstepped his legal authority by temporarily suspending all immigration from seven entire countries. It points to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which forbids discrimination based on a person\u2019s nationality or country of origin.\n\n\u201cWhile the president has certain powers, he doesn\u2019t have power to defy this clause,\u201d Adams said.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have offered legislation to overturn Trump's order, but they have not gathered any Republican support. Democrats staged a protest on the steps of the Supreme Court Monday evening to rail against the executive order.\n\nReplacing Yates is Boente, who has served in various positions inside the Justice Department over more than 30 years, beginning in the Tax Division.\n\nIn 2001, he served as the assistand U.S. attorney in the fraud unit in the Eastern District of Virginia. In December 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder appointed him to serve as the chief federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Louisiana. He held that position until September 2013, and Obama nominated him to be U.S. Attorney in Alexandria, Va. in 2015.\n\nRead more:\n\n.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jPhxKb", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/59944aa10e6639a6353c627ec6c5148a0b0a6eb0/c=0-307-2996-2000&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/01/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636213996782163944-GTY-543412508-82973366.JPG", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 02:59:43 -0500", "summary": "Yates 'not convinced' order is lawful&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["attorney", "general", "ag", "yates", "federal", "ouster", "executive", "obama", "immigration", "enforce", "order", "acting", "trumps", "president", "boente", "defend", "dana", "laws"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Sunday Standings: Tallying the top talk-show guests", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/89380875/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Sunday-Standings-Tallying-the-top-talkshow-guests/", "text": "Hi\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nAlready a print edition subscriber, but don't have a login?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/2015/03/sunday-shows/img/fb-post.jpg", "publishedDate": "Wed, 14 Dec 2016 13:25:43 -0500", "summary": "USA TODAY is keeping score, tracking who's most in demand week-to-week on the Sunday talk show circuit.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": [], "keywords": ["standings", "dont", "hialready", "subscriberalready", "subscriber", "edition", "print", "login"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Pomp and protests: Inaugurating a president and his movement", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/246615640/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Pomp-and-protests-Inaugurating-a-president-and-his-movement/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Boris Epshteyn, 34, a Republican activist from New Jersey who became one of Donald Trump\u2019s most vigorous defenders on cable TV during the campaign discusses plans for the Jan. 20 inauguration festivities.

The Presidential Inaugural Committee works out of a nondescript General Services Administration building in southwest Washington, D.C. The bare-bones offices are decorated with hand-cut snowflakes and a few random strings of Christmas lights. Boris Epshteyn, 34, a Republican activist from New Jersey who became one of Donald Trump\u2019s most vigorous defenders on cable TV during the campaign, is now communications director for the operation planning for the Jan. 20 festivities. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: A big Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 \u2014 and an unprecedented number of protesters expected. Are you concerned?\n\nEpshteyn: Americans have First Amendment rights and we are very honored that people will come to celebrate this inauguration, and we understand that some will come and protest, and that\u2019s fully within their rights as long as they do it peacefully, and within all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the message President-elect Trump wants to convey on that day?\n\nEpshteyn: It\u2019s all about unity. It\u2019s about the country coming together, being one America, America uniting, and him being the president for all Americans. That\u2019s really the key message.\n\nQ: There\u2019s been criticism that during the transition he hasn\u2019t done enough to reach out to those who didn\u2019t support him.\n\nEpshteyn: He\u2019s been very clear that he\u2019s president of all Americans, not just those who supported him, but all Americans and he wants all people to not give up their dreams, not to downsize their dreams, and that goes for all Americans.\n\nRead more:\n\nQ: He\u2019s reduced the number of inaugural balls, from the 10 that President Obama had to three. Why?\n\nEpshteyn: This is not a coronation. It\u2019s an inauguration. It\u2019s a day to work and a day to get to work. And the president-elect, the incoming president, is someone who\u2019s eager to get to work, who\u2019s eager to make sure Americans are safe, to make sure Americans are employed.\n\nQ: There have been reports you\u2019ve had trouble lining up A-list celebrities. True?\n\nEpshteyn: Absolutely not. We\u2019ve had celebrities from all over the world reaching out, wanting to perform. But this inauguration is of the people; it\u2019s by the people; it\u2019s for the people. It\u2019s not about celebrities; it\u2019s not about entertainers. ...\n\nThe election was really a celebration of the Trump movement. And this day, in addition to celebrating the transfer of power, of course brings in the fact that the Trump movement is now coming into power to D.C. in full force. Starting at noon on Jan. 20, Donald Trump will be representing the Trump movement. And what is that? That\u2019s bucking the establishment again, right? That\u2019s going against the special interests, going against the way that things have been a long time in a negative way and bringing in that new, fresh wave.\n\nQ: President Jackson threw the doors of the White House open.\n\nEpshteyn: You will definitely see throughout the week specific parts of events, specific representations of the movement and of the openness to the American people of Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C., the special interests \u2014 the swamp, as we called it during the campaign \u2014 has been closed off from the American people, removed from the American people in a big way, and that\u2019s going to change starting on Jan. 20.\n\nQ: For example?\n\nEpshteyn: There\u2019s going to be the welcoming event on Jan. 19. As part of that event you could see something that very much again transcends what Washington, D.C., has been and represents. ...\n\nIt\u2019s not just a party. It\u2019s a commemoration, a commemoration of the transfer of power but again also of the fact that we are ringing in this new presidency and it\u2019s the Trump presidency, very different from any we\u2019ve seen in the past and very much different from the one we could have seen with Hillary Clinton, if she had won.\n\nWorkers build portions of the inaugural platform for President-elect Donald Trump at the Capitol on Dec. 8, 2016. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nQ: You were one of Trump\u2019s most loyal surrogates during the campaign. You accused Hillary Clinton of using a Gold Star family as a prop; you defended Trump after the Access Hollywood tape was released. Did you ever have a point when you thought, \u2018I can\u2019t defend him anymore\u2019?\n\nEpshteyn: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Because I always firmly believed that it was binary choice between Hillary Clinton and the leader of Donald Trump, who was effective, who was pragmatic, who was smart and who truly leads. And I always believed that he was the right person for this job and nothing made me waver from that, especially not some of these gimmicks that some of the left tried to throw at him.\n\nQ: You were born in the Soviet Union; your family immigrated to the United States when you were 11. When New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg died in 2013, you thanked him for pushing the law that let your family in.\n\nEpshteyn: We were Jewish refugees and we came to this country in the early '90s and Frank Lautenberg was part of this legislation, the Lautenberg Amendment, that allowed for Russian Jews to come to the United States and to go through the specific processes, to follow the laws, rules and regulations. We were refugees. We had a white card, then a green card, and then we studied for the (citizenship) test. My folks took the test and we became citizens \u2014 so proud to follow the law and to be citizens of this beautiful country.\n\nQ: How does that affect you when you see refugees today in Syria and elsewhere?\n\nEpshteyn: My heart breaks. My heart breaks for the folks, for the people in Syria, the people in Aleppo. It\u2019s an absolutely terrible situation. And I really hope, as Donald Trump said throughout the campaign, that we have safe zones in Syria and have a way for those folks in Syria to be protected and to be safe.\n\nQ: Do you wish the United States did more for refugees, took in more refugees?\n\nEpshteyn: I think we do a lot. I think the United States does a ton for folks around the world \u2014 folks like ourselves, again, who follow the processes that are laid out. It took us a long time. It took us a long time to apply to be able to come, and then once we came it took a long time to be citizens. ...\n\nI work hard every single day to do everything I can to not just make my family proud but to make this country proud and thankful that they welcomed us with open arms.\n\nStay with USA TODAY for full coverage of the 2017 inauguration.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ib4AJ6", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/926da5f153e08d2ccfca28452d02bb992f418b8f/c=0-79-6484-3742&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/12/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636178184470043524-XXX-BORIS-EPSHTEYN-12-DCB-87496398.JPG", "publishedDate": "Wed, 21 Dec 2016 09:24:12 -0500", "summary": "Boris Epshteyn promises Jan. 20 events to demonstrate a \"new wave\" has arrived in D.C.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;", "source": "USA Today", "authors": ["USA TODAY"], "keywords": ["inaugurating", "trump", "inauguration", "took", "long", "jan", "donald", "americans", "folks", "president", "thats", "movement"], "tags": []}, {"title": "Exclusive: Tony Blair sees dangerous times ahead for Western democracies", "url": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/239007874/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Exclusive-Tony-Blair-sees-dangerous-times-ahead-for-Western-democracies/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair speaks with USA TODAY Washington bureau chief Susan Page about the current political climate of many Western democracies.

Given the rise of extreme voices on the left and right, he said, \"I'm not sure we're asking the right questions right now, never mind giving the right answers.\"\n\nOf particular concern to him is a \"longing\" for an authoritarian leader.\n\n\"It's amazing how many people you will find who will reference a style of leadership of (Russian) President Putin in a positive way,\" he told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. \"I think people want their country moving and they think that if the present system is not moving it, and not making the changes that they want to see, then maybe someone who just says, 'I don't care what anyone thinks; I'm just going to go for it, and this is what I'm going to do' \u2014 that has a certain attraction.\n\n\"If the center isn't a place of strength and vitality, and it looks kind of flabby and just managing the status quo, then you're at risk of someone coming along and doing that.\"\n\nIn his speech to the No Labels conference, he faulted some centrist political leaders for failing to do enough to improve the economic prospects for workers disrupted by globalization and to ensure a sense of personal safety at a time, for instance, that Great Britain and other European countries have absorbed a wave of immigrants from Syria. \"People will only put aside prejudices if they think there are rules,\" he said.\n\nBlair sees a common thread from Brexit's passage to Trump's election to support for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a provocative figure whose anti-drug campaign is blamed for thousands of deaths.\n\nTony Blair speaks at a No Labels event in Washington on Dec. 5, 2016. (Photo: Paul Morigi, AP Images for No Labels)\n\n\"There is immense amount of anger at established ways of doing things,\" Blair said. \"There is, I think, a whole group of people who feel ignored by those in power, that is for sure true. There is more anger around in politics than for a long time.\" While issues such as immigration aren't new, there is \"much greater skepticism towards globalization and the benefits of it.\"\n\nWhat's more, \"social media is a revolutionary phenomenon,\" he went on. \"It changes the way politics works. It changes the way the media works. If we're not careful, it locks people into conversations with people who just agree with them, and who then have a general conspiracy-theory view of the rest of the world.\"\n\nBlair has never met Trump and didn't criticize him.\n\nAsked about whether it was wise for Trump to accept a congratulatory telephone call from the president of Taiwan \u2014 the sort of conversation every American president since 1979 deliberately has avoided \u2014 Blair demurred. \"I'm not going to get into your politics,\" he began. \"To be honest, in the end, I'll tell you what I really think: Let's see how it works out.\"\n\n\"I'm less worried about America than I am about Europe; I'll be very frank with you,\" he said. \"America is such a strong country and you've got so many checks-and-balances and you've got such resilience in your economy and so on; you guys will do fine, I'm sure. In Europe, we have systems that are at a point of fragility that troubles me.\"\n\nBlair was just 54 years old when he moved out of 10 Downing Street after serving as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. His political appeal for a \"new way\" was akin to President Bill Clinton's \"third way\" for Democrats here, and he was a crucial ally for President George W. Bush during the Iraq War.\n\nNow he offers a bit of free advice for President Obama, who will move out the White House next month at age 55: Find a cause.\n\n\"When you've got young political leaders and then they leave office young, you've got to find something that really motivates you,\" he said. \"The reason I spent so much time on the Middle East is that I'm deeply motivated by it. But you've got to find something that gets you up in the morning with the same sense of purpose and excitement as happened when you were prime minister or president.\"\n\nCapital Download with former British prime minister Tony Blair and USA TODAY's Susan Page.

USA TODAY\n\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich on USA TODAY's Capital Download (Photo: Sean Dougherty, USAT)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Former House speaker Newt Gingrich calls Donald Trump a potentially transformative president. But he shouldn't have sent out that tweet alleging election fraud.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with Capital Download, Gingrich, a free-wheeling Trump adviser who is a vice-chairman of his transition team, described the president-elect as a leader who is poised to disrupt the regular order in a way no commander in chief has done since Andrew Jackson in the 19th century.\n\nBut he also said that Trump's biggest misstep in the three weeks since he won the White House was to post on Twitter Sunday a complaint asserting widespread voter fraud, and in an election he won. \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide,\" Trump wrote, \"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"\n\n\"The president of the United States can't randomly tweet without having somebody check it out,\" Gingrich told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. \"It makes you wonder about whatever else he's doing. It undermines much more than a single tweet.\"\n\nDoes he see any evidence of millions of illegal votes?\n\n\"No,\" Gingrich says.\n\nThe former House speaker, who led a political disruption of his own when Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1994, says the best thing Trump has done so far is to name campaign chairman Steve Bannon and Republican national chairman Reince Priebus to his top White House staff. \"You have a very hard-line conservative warrior as your chief strategist and you have a really sophisticated manager of the establishment as your chief of staff,\" he says.\n\nThat said, Gingrich is caustic toward another potential Trump appointment, of Mitt Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. Trump and Romney were slated to meet Tuesday for a second time, reportedly to discuss the role of secretary of State for the GOP's 2012 nominee, who was perhaps Trump's fiercest Republican critic during the campaign.\n\n\"I think it's outrageous,\" Gingrich says. \"Romney said vile and vicious things. Romney opposed him all the way up to the election. In my judgment, Romney will be a very high risk ... because I think Romney has zero interest in the Trump revolution and every interest in re-establishing his own credentials.\"\n\nWhile he views former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as a better choice, Gingrich says House Speaker Paul Ryan \"is very strongly in favor of Romney\" and that Priebus is \"pretty strongly\" in favor of him. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, however, has warned of a grassroots revolt if Romney is named to the Cabinet's top job.\n\nWhen he met with Trump last week, Gingrich says, \"He commented, 'This is really a bigger job than I thought.' Which is good. He should think that.\" As president, Gingrich went on, \"you have war and peace, you have enormous powers ... and it all comes down to the Oval Office and it all comes down to you.\"\n\nHe argues that Trump, who hasn't held a news conference since July, should feel no obligation to hold any as president, suggesting instead he solicit questions from the public to answer. \"The news media so totally disgraced itself in this election, if I were Trump I would just say no,\" Gingrich says. \"And if the White House Correspondents Association doesn't like it, I'd say, 'Fine, disband.'\"\n\nGingrich says the political world hasn't yet come to grips with the sort of fundamental change the election of \"the most insurgent president in American history\" could bring. He describes Trump as \"one-third Andrew Jackson in disruption, one-third Theodore Roosevelt in sheer energy, and one-third P.T.

Bernie Sanders called for \u201crethinking\u201d the Electoral College and warned President-elect Donald Trump that he should expect more street protests if he pursues divisive policies. USA TODAY\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (Photo: Jack Gruber, USAT)\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the surprisingly strong challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination, sat down Sunday with USA TODAY's Capital Download to talk about last week's election stunner, the future of the Democratic Party and his new book, being published Tuesday by Thomas Dunne Books, Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: If you had been nominated, would you have won?\n\nSanders: Monday-morning quarterbacking is always easy. The answer is, I don\u2019t know. Nobody knows. I certainly wish I had had that opportunity. Some of the polls out there suggest that might have been the case.\n\nQ: How much overlap was there between you and Donald Trump in your appeal?\n\nSanders: There is an overlap, that Trump very successfully understood a lot of people are angry. They feel the economy of this country is not working for them. I mean, Trump was incredibly weak, and its ahistorical, the lack of specificity that he had in any of his proposals. Boy, Hillary Clinton had 87 different proposals all lined up and Trump said, \u2018We\u2019re going to do this great. It\u2019s going to be excellent. Really excellent.\u2019 What are you talking about? \u2018Excellent, fantastic program.\u2019 No details, no nothing. ...\n\nThe overwhelming stuff on television had to do with political gossip. Know everything you want to know about Hillary\u2019s emails and Donald Trump\u2019s attitude toward women. Why is the middle class in decline? Why are we the only major country not to have paid family leave? Why aren\u2019t our kids able to afford to go to college? Those are the issues that we have got to talk about. Does corporate media talk about it? No. ...\n\nOur Revolution: A Future to Believe In, by Bernie Sanders (Photo: Thomas Dunne Books)\n\nIt is naive to not understand who owns the media in America, the major media: large, multinational conglomerates. What is their goal? Their goal is to make money. Is there a basic conflict between making money for large media and having a serious discussion on issues that impact working people? Yeah, I think there are.\n\nQ: We see anti-Trump demonstrations cropping up across the country. Is that a good thing?\n\nSanders: We have a First Amendment. People are angry. People are upset. And they want to express their point of view that they are very frightened, in very, very strong disagreement with Mr. Trump, who has made bigotry the cornerstone of his campaign. ...\n\nI think that people are saying, \u2018Mr. Trump, we have come too far in this country fighting discrimination and bigotry. We\u2019re not going back. And if you\u2019re going to continue that effort, you\u2019re going to have to take us on.\u2019 ...\n\nWe may want to take a look at the whole Electoral College, which is seating a man for president who didn\u2019t get the most votes. This is something we need a serious discussion on. This campaign revolved around 15 states of the country, right? Battleground states. My state of Vermont is a strong Democratic state; no one paid attention. Wyoming is a Republican state; nobody paid attention to Wyoming. Is that a good way?\n\nQ: Would it be good to change the Electoral College?\n\nA: I think you ought to think about this. ... I think we want to rethink that.\n\nQ: Is it fair to say you wrote this book on the assumption Clinton would win?\n\nSanders: I thought there was a 2-1 shot she was going to win. I was not one of those who was shocked by a Trump victory. ...\n\nQ: You were in the minority to think there was even a one in three shot that Donald Trump would win.\n\nSanders: Look, I campaigned in 46 states in this country. The punditry and the inside-the-Beltway mentality really has very little understanding of what\u2019s going on with working people. It\u2019s really almost embarrassing. ...\n\nYou\u2019re a working person, you can\u2019t afford child care for your kids. Why is it after working your whole life you can\u2019t afford to send your kid to college? Why is it that you\u2019re having a decent job at a factory, and that factory has gone to China? Why is it that you\u2019re seeing almost all new income and wealth go to the top 1%? People are angry and they\u2019re frustrated.\n\nQ: You\u2019re supporting Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison for Democratic national chairman. Is he going to win?\n\nSanders: He stands a good chance....\n\nIt\u2019s not just this election where it is still hard to believe that Trump won. But Republicans control the Senate. They control the House. They have done phenomenally well over the past eight years in state legislatures around the country, in governor races. And people are asking: How does it happen that a political party which wants to give tax breaks to billionaires, which nobody supports; which wants to cut programs for working people; wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid; many of whose members do not even believe in the reality of climate change \u2013 how in God\u2019s name do these guys win elections? Well, the Democratic leadership of today hasn\u2019t figured this out. It is time for profound change. ...\n\nWhat this book is about -- and I know people are going to say, \u2018Oh my God, Bernie talks about the economy, talks about health care, talks about immigration, talks about criminal justice, talks about all these things how boring can it be?\u2019 I know it will be criticized. Boring. It\u2019s wonky. But I think we got to begin talking about real issues.\n\nQ: There are quite a few charts in your book.\n\nSanders: (Laughs) Yes.\n\nQ: Are you going to run another term in the Senate in 2018?\n\nSanders: Probably, but I haven\u2019t made that decision.\n\nQ: Is it conceivable you would run for president again?\n\nSanders: You know, it\u2019s conceivable that I may fly to the moon.\n\nQ: With all respect, it\u2019s not conceivable that you may fly to the moon.\n\nSanders: If Elon Musk (founder of SpaceX) called me, I could go to Mars. See, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m going to make Mars a progressive planet. I\u2019ll be there first, planting the flag.

(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nDana Perino, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, personifies the GOP\u2019s looming crisis with women voters. At 44, she is a lifelong Republican and aide to Republican officeholders, but she\u2019s not voting for Donald Trump on Election Day. Perino, co-host of Fox's The Five, is promoting her new book, Let Me Tell You About Jasper: How My Best Friend Became America\u2019s Dog, published by Twelve. She was interviewed for USA TODAY's Capital Download Friday in New York. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: You\u2019ve worked for Republican congressmen, in a Republican Justice Department and at a Republican White House. So are you voting for the Republican presidential nominee next month?\n\nPerino: I do feel adrift as a Republican woman, maybe a woman without a party. ... You sort of feel like, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I belong anymore.\u2019 Now, there are plenty of Republican women that support Donald Trump fervently and passionately, without any hesitation. I just have hesitation and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even going to vote, and I have a perfect voting record.\n\nQ: Why is Trump losing so many women voters?\n\nPerino: I think that a lot of women in their gut are concerned about the temperament, and knowledge and experience, (although) they don\u2019t necessarily like Hillary Clinton. ...\n\nUnless the Republican Party changes either the way that it talks about things (like sexual assault) or the way it approaches issues like paid maternity leave, they\u2019re going to risk losing women in the future. But it also depends on how Hillary Clinton decides to govern, and I think we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to be like, if she becomes president.\n\n'Let Me Tell You About Jasper,' by Dana Perino (Photo: Twelve, Hachette Book Group)\n\nQ: A question for you from a reader on Twitter: What did you think about the exchange between Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich? (Gingrich accused the Fox News anchor of being \u201cfascinated by sex\u201d when she asked about allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump.)\n\nPerino: I thought Megyn was extremely, exceedingly professional. I do think that it\u2019s a news story and I don\u2019t think that the news media is just making up the news story. ...\n\nWhen he (Trump) went to Gettysburg (Pa.) and he made the Gettysburg address, I called it the Gettysburg redress of grievances. Because substantively, if you\u2019re a Republican, you could read that speech or listen to it, and say \u2018I agree with all that. School choice, lower taxes, I\u2019m for that.\u2019 But adding the paragraph that he\u2019s going to sue all the women (accusers) after the election \u2013 one, to me was about intimidation to make sure if you were thinking of coming out, don\u2019t. It\u2019s calling women liars and it\u2019s putting them on the defensive. Look, we just went through a summer at Fox News where questions of sexual harassment came up.\n\nQ: The issue of sexual harassment has had a political power this year it hasn\u2019t had before.\n\nPerino: I certainly think so. In fact, what I thought was strange about the way the Trump campaign handled all that was, one of their strongest talking points against Hillary Clinton\u2019s character had been how accusers of Bill Clinton had been treated through the years. But now accusers of Donald Trump are being treated in the exact same way that they complain Hillary Clinton treated those women. So it kind of canceled each other out. No wonder people are dissatisfied with this election.\n\nQ: Do you think Trump could win?\n\nPerino: I think it\u2019s unlikely. However, I do remember 2000.... I do think that anything could happen.\n\nWhen Donald Trump\u2019s campaign says that there are a lot of undecideds out there and people who are not willing to admit that they plan to vote for Donald Trump, that might be true. But I also think it could be true on the other side as well. For instance, these Republican women who feel adrift, if they decide they\u2019re going to go to the polls to vote for Hillary Clinton, they\u2019re probably not telling too many people about that.\n\nQ: Are you a secret Hillary Clinton voter?\n\nPerino: No, I am not going to vote for Hillary.\n\nQ: Is it conceivable you would vote for Trump?\n\nPerino: No. My question right now is: Do I go in and write in a candidate that I don\u2019t even know? Or do I not even go? .... It pains me to think about not voting, but not that much, actually. I feel that decision is actually making a statement.\n\nPresident George W.

On Saturday, the U.S. processed thousands of incoming foreign travelers in airports across the country.\n\nKelly also gave assurances Tuesday that he and his agents would execute the order \u201chumanely and with professionalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot gamble with American lives,\u201d said Kelly, who also made clear that the temporary bans on immigration from the seven countries and on the U.S. accepting Syrian refugees is \u201cnot a ban on Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Muslims living on this planet have access to the United States. A small number is being help up temporarily,\u201d said Kelly, suggesting a major problem is getting good information from the seven countries to verify \u201cwho these people say they are.\u201d\n\nKelly was joined at the press conference by Kevin McAleenan, the acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, who said the agency\u2019s top officials, upon getting guidance from the White House, immediately began making calls, providing written guidance to field agents and contacting \u201cstakeholders,\u201d particularly the airlines.\n\nHe also said 872 refugees will be allowed into the U.S. despite the order, under individual waivers.\n\nMcAleenan pledged his agency\u2019s commitment to carrying out the executive order and said he had no knowledge of insubordinate agents.\n\nHowever, McAleenan acknowledged that \u201cthe communication hasn't been great in the initial hours of this rollout.\"", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/01/31/0/0/694940094001_5305240972001_5305222864001-vs.jpg?ve=1", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:31:00 GMT", "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Tuesday denied reports that he was kept in the dark about President Trump\u2019s immigration executive order, while defending the plan's implementation and vowing to carry out the order \"humanely.\"", "source": "Fox News", "authors": [], "keywords": ["seven", "knew", "trump", "wasnt", "house", "executive", "reports", "press", "kelly", "surprise", "white", "dhs", "order", "secretary"], "tags": ["a7616a99-9f83-4abd-be71-2d2d16c9de58", "fox-news/politics/executive/cabinet", "fox-news/politics", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Cabinet", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS", "fnc", "fnc/politics/executive", "article", "FoxNews.com"]}, {"title": "Ryan calls immigration order rollout 'regrettable,' defends Trump", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/VzJ1Q92HEpE/ryan-calls-immigration-order-rollout-regrettable-defends-trump.html", "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that the \u201cconfusion\u201d surrounding the rollout of President Trump\u2019s immigration executive order was \u201cregrettable,\u201d though he defended the national security goals of the sweeping measure signed late last week.\n\nAt a press briefing, Ryan said nobody wanted to see green-card holders and others \u201ccaught up\u201d in the implementation of Trump\u2019s Friday order, which suspended the U.S. refugee program and restricted immigration and travel from seven mostly Muslim countries.\n\nBut some travelers, including green-card holders, were held up amid conflicting statements over the weekend about whom the order affected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable on the confusion of the rollout of this,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nAt the same time, Ryan said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to secure our border.\u201d\n\nRyan defended the president in saying the U.S. needs to hit pause and ensure vetting standards are tight.\n\nHe also voiced confidence in Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly\u2019s ability to carry out the order properly, saying he has spoken with the secretary.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/01/31/0/0/694940094001_5303938851001_5303890986001-vs.jpg?ve=1", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 15:55:00 GMT", "summary": "House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that the \u201cconfusion\u201d surrounding the rollout of President Trump\u2019s immigration executive order was \u201cregrettable,\u201d though he defended the national security goals of the sweeping measure signed late last week.", "source": "Fox News", "authors": [], "keywords": ["saying", "trump", "calls", "regrettable", "immigration", "ryan", "defends", "trumps", "rollout", "president", "security", "order", "secretary"], "tags": ["32befd11-2d50-4e3b-aa10-91efa2c7585e", "fox-news/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans", "fox-news/politics", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/Republicans", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS", "fnc", "fnc/politics", "article", "FoxNews.com"]}, {"title": "Tensions flare in Senate over Trump Cabinet picks", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/vBhuyGlFZg8/senate-panel-backs-perry-zinke-nominations-amid-sessions-fight.html", "text": "Congressional tensions over President Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks \u2013 and his executive order on immigration \u2013 flared Tuesday as Democrats blocked committee votes on two major nominees and clashed with Republicans over the nomination of Sen.

Ryan Zinke for Interior secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry for Energy secretary. And a separate panel approved Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. The full Senate will still have to vote on those nominees.\n\nBut drama was unfolding elsewhere on Capitol Hill.\n\nRepublicans on Tuesday were forced to indefinitely delay Senate Finance Committee votes on the nominations of GOP Georgia Rep. Tom Price to be Health secretary and financier Steve Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department, after Democrats boycotted a planned meeting.\n\nFinance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he planned to reschedule the votes but did not say when. He said Democrats \"ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots.\"\n\nDemanding more information, Democrats cited a report in The Wall Street Journal that Price received a discounted offer to buy stock in a biomedical company, which contradicted his testimony to Congress. They said another report showed documents revealing Mnuchin had not been truthful with the Senate about how his bank OneWest had handled home foreclosures.\n\nMeanwhile, senators were clashing during a protracted meeting considering the nomination of Jeff Sessions for attorney general.\n\nSessions, a conservative senator from Alabama, was an early backer of Trump. During his confirmation hearing he was dogged by allegations of racism \u2013 something he strongly denies.\n\nBut his nomination was further complicated by the fallout from Trump's controversial executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program and restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, when she defiantly refused to defend Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order. Trump said Yates had betrayed the administration by not carrying out the order and replaced her with Dana Boente, a U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Boente announced he would rescind Yates\u2019 policy \u2013 effective immediately.\n\nMonday\u2019s firing and escalating tension over Trump\u2019s executive order made Tuesday\u2019s vote on Sessions particularly contentious.\n\nThe committee\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, took Sessions to task and tried to tie him to the controversial order and the Trump administration, as she announced her opposition.\n\n\u201cNot one order, idea or pronouncement is meant to bring this country together, they only serve to drive us further apart,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cIt is in this context we are being asked to consider this nomination.\u201d\n\nFeinstein also praised Yates and said standing up to Trump \u201ctook a steel spine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what an attorney general must be willing to do,\u201d she said before adding she has \u201cno confidence\u201d Sessions would be able to stand up to the president.\n\nSessions has denied he was involved in helping draft Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\n\u201cNeither I, nor any of my current staff, had such a role,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo \u201cCode Pink\u201d protesters wearing pink shirts and in their 70s were dragged out of the hearing room after voicing their opposition to Sessions.\n\nA separate Senate committee took up the nomination Tuesday of DeVos to head up Education. Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Health, Education, Pensions and Labor Committee battled over the charter school activist and wealthy Republican donor\u2019s credentials, before the panel advanced her nomination to the Senate floor.\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the committee, said it was clear that DeVos is \"the wrong choice.\"\n\nMurray charged that DeVos has spent her family's wealth to push \"extreme anti-student ideology\" siphoning money away from public schools \"toward taxpayer funded private school vouchers, with little accountability, for just a few.\"\n\nCommittee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., pushed back. He said he didn\u2019t question the motives of his colleagues but thinks their concerns are \u201cmisplaced.\u201d\n\nAll the candidates had strong Republican support going into the committee meetings.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/01/31/0/0/694940094001_5304773831001_2553193403001-vs.jpg?ve=1", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 14:54:00 GMT", "summary": "Congressional tensions over President Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks \u2013 and his executive order on immigration \u2013 flared Tuesday as Democrats blocked committee votes on two major nominees and clashed with Republicans over the nomination of Sen.

Chris Christie \u2013 an adviser to the president \u2013 backs Trump\u2019s promise to cut funding to them.\n\n\"We intend to stand by our principles and values as a city,\" Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a statement. \"Jersey City was founded as a city of immigrants, and we are unwilling to be part of orders that break families apart or harm immigrants who are in this country.\"\n\nChristie last week, however, reiterated his support of Trump\u2019s orders. The governor so far has given no indication of what moves he would take against cities that fail to comply.\n\n\"I agree with [Trump]. I took that same position when I ran for president,\u201d Christie said on his monthly call-in radio show. \u201cElected officials can't be allowed to pick and choose which laws they choose to comply with.\"\n\nEast Orange, Maplewood, Newark, Princeton, and Middlesex and Union counties also are considered sanctuary jurisdictions, although the definitions of what that is varies.\n\nIn some cases, sanctuary cities tell police not to inquire about the immigration status of those they encounter, or they decline requests from immigration officials to keep defendants in custody while they await deportation. Other municipalities cooperate with such \"detainer\" requests as long as they're backed by court-issued warrants, but won't allow local officers to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nTexas A&M\u2019s Morrison said it would be difficult for Christie to enforce Trump\u2019s orders as the state adheres to home rule which gives local municipalities much more power in administering laws.\n\nIllinois\n\nExpand / Contract Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at a press conference in Chicago. (The Associated Press)\n\nThe city of Chicago has been a major target of Trump\u2019s criticism since the campaign. And Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2013 who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff and is no fan of Trump's \u2013dug in after the sanctuary city measure was signed.\n\n\"We're going to stay a sanctuary city,\" Emanuel said. \"Wherever you came from, you're welcome here.\"\n\nEmanuel has not said how much money Chicago stands to lose for being a sanctuary city \u2013 or given any details about how he would fill the gap in federal funding \u2013 but the city would otherwise be expected to receive $1.3 billion (14 percent of its 2017 budget) from Washington. The Center for Tax and Budget Accountability said Trump would need Congress' approval to take back all the city's federal funding.\n\nWhether a battle is looming with the state is not yet clear.\n\nIllinois\u2019 Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner so far has remained mum on the issue of sanctuary cities \u2013 despite pressure from Emanuel to take a position. When asked to respond to Chicago\u2019s plan to remain a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d a Rauner spokeswoman sent the Chicago Tribune a statement reiterating the governor's support for immigration reform.\n\nLouisiana\n\nExpand / Contract (REUTERS/Lee Celano)\n\nFollowing the San Francisco killing of Kate Steinle by an illegal immigrant in 2015, numerous lawmakers across the country began calling for a crackdown on sanctuary cities.\n\nOne of the most vocal was former Sen. David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana who pushed legislation to deny immigration enforcement funding to cities with sanctuary policies. One of those cities turned out to be New Orleans.\n\nThe city police department's policy on immigration hold requests dates back to 2013 and was part of the settlement to a civil rights lawsuit centering around construction workers who were held long after their sentences expired.\n\nVitter did not get his wish, however, and in 2016, the NOPD implemented a policy forbidding officers from so much as inquiring into an individual's immigration status.\n\nDespite a Republican-controlled legislature in Baton Rouge, a state Senate committee last spring gutted a bill that would have punished two sanctuary cities and effectively killed the bill before it was brought to the floor.\n\nBut even though the state has a Democratic governor, the issue could resurface in the wake of Trump's order.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nExpand / Contract Boston Mayor Martin Walsh waves at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 25, 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron - RTSJLV3\n\nPerhaps no official has gone further to defy Trump\u2019s vow than Boston Mayor Martin Walsh.\n\nThe first-term Democratic mayor said last Wednesday he would do everything in his power to protect Boston residents living in the country without authorization \u2013 even if that means using City Hall as a shelter.\n\n\u201cIf people want to live here, they\u2019ll live here. They can use my office. They can use any office in this building,\u2019\u2019 Walsh said during a press conference at City Hall, according to the Boston Globe.\n\n\u201cWashington is advancing the most destructive and un-American threat on America during the campaign,\u2019\u2019 Walsh added. \u201cThe latest executive orders and statements by the president are a direct attack on Boston\u2019s people, Boston\u2019s strength and Boston\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts is one state, though, where the differences between city and state officials might not lead to a major clash.\n\nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker, during a forum last week that he and the Boston mayor attended, said while he doesn\u2019t want the Bay State to become a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d he believes cities and towns \u201cshould be allowed to make their own decisions\u201d in regards to their approaches in law enforcement.\n\nBoston's version of the 2014 Trust Act prevents police from reporting immigrants to federal authorities. Supporters of the act say its intent is meant to keep local police out of the business of deportation and to make sure that immigrants don\u2019t see law enforcement as a threat.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/01/28/0/0/694940094001_5301239220001_5301237040001-vs.jpg?ve=1", "publishedDate": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 07:45:00 GMT", "summary": "President Trump\u2019s vow to cut off millions of dollars in federal funds to cities that protect undocumented immigrants has set up a clash not only between his administration and local mayors -- but between the largely Democrat-led cities and Republican-led states.", "source": "Fox News", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "keywords": ["city", "sanctuary", "federal", "showdown", "immigration", "mayor", "states", "state", "trumps", "sets", "president", "cities", "local", "order"], "tags": ["b667d61b-1c91-4ced-a498-02a66807ef07", "fox-news/us/immigration", "fox-news/politics/state-and-local/cities", "/FOX NEWS/US/IMMIGRATION", "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Cities", "fnc", "fnc/politics/state-local", "article", "FoxNews.com", "Andrew O'Reilly"]}, {"title": "Sessions once asked Yates about AG's responsibility to say 'no' to a president", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/5GTVInv_gJk/sessions-once-asked-yates-about-ags-responsibility-to-say-no-to-president.html", "text": "President Trump\u2019s selection for attorney general once questioned Sally Yates during a confirmation hearing in 2015 about whether the role of an attorney general was simply follow marching orders from the sitting president.\n\n\u201cIf the views the president wants to execute is unlawful, should the attorney general or deputy attorney general say no?\u201d Sessions asked.\n\n\u201cSenator, I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has the obligation to follow the law and the Consitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president,\u201d she responded.\n\nTrump relieved acting Attorney General Yates of her duties Monday night after she directed Justice Department attorneys not to defend Trump's controversial executive refugee and immigration ban.\n\nYates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was replaced by Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
