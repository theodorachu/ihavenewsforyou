Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Boente was sworn in at 9 p.m., according to White House officials, who did not provide details about who performed the ceremony. In a statement, Mr. Boente pledged to \u201cdefend and enforce the laws of our country.\u201d\n\nAt 9:15 p.m., Ms. Yates received a hand-delivered letter at the Justice Department that informed her that she was fired. Signed by John DeStefano, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House aides, the letter informed Ms. Yates that \u201cthe president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo minutes later, the White House officials lashed out at Ms. Yates in a statement issued by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.\n\n\u201cMs. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe firing of Ms. Yates came at the end of a turbulent three days that began on Friday with Mr. Trump\u2019s signing of his executive order. The action stranded travelers around the world, led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Yates, like other senior government officials, was caught by surprise by the executive order and agonized over the weekend about how to respond, two Justice Department officials involved in the weekend deliberations said. Ms. Yates considered resigning but she told colleagues she did not want to leave it to her successor to face the same dilemma.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, Ms. Yates added to a deepening sense of anxiety in the nation\u2019s capital by publicly confronting the president with a stinging challenge to his authority, laying bare a deep divide at the Justice Department, within the diplomatic corps and elsewhere in the government over the wisdom of his order.\n\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,\u201d Ms. Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s senior aides huddled together in the West Wing to determine what to do.\n\nThey decided quickly that her insubordination could not stand, according to an administration official familiar with the deliberations. Among the chief concerns was whether Mr. Sessions could be confirmed quickly by the Senate.\n\nAfter Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, received reassurances from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, that the confirmation was on track, aides took their recommendation to Mr. Trump in the White House residence.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

He accused Democrats of holding up the confirmation of Mr. Sessions for political reasons. \u201cCalling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\u201d\n\nFormer Justice Department officials said the president\u2019s action would send a deep shudder through an agency that was already on edge as officials anticipated an ideological overhaul once Mr. Sessions takes over. One former senior official said that department lawyers would be unnerved by the firing.\n\nVideo\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, hailed Ms. Yates as a principled defender of what she thought was right. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that the \u201cattorney general should be loyal and pledge fidelity to the law, not the White House. The fact that this administration doesn\u2019t understand that is chilling.\u201d\n\nMr. Boente has told the White House that he is willing to sign off on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees and immigration, according to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, Va., where Mr. Boente has served as the top prosecutor since 2015.\n\nMr. Boente, who has been a prosecutor with the Justice Department for 31 years, had no hesitation about accepting the acting attorney general\u2019s job given his \u201cseniority and loyalty\u201d to the department, Mr. Stueve said in a telephone interview on Monday night.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Ms. Yates was the only person at the Justice Department authorized to sign applications for foreign surveillance warrants. Administrations of both parties have interpreted surveillance laws as requiring foreign surveillance warrants be signed only by Senate-confirmed Justice Department officials. Mr. Boente was Senate-confirmed as United States attorney and, though the situation is unprecedented, the White House said he was authorized to sign the warrants.\n\nMs. Yates\u2019s decision had effectively overruled a finding by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which had already approved the executive order \u201cwith respect to form and legality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Yates said her determination in deciding not to defend the order was broader, however, and included questions not only about the order\u2019s lawfulness, but also whether it was a \u201cwise or just\u201d policy. She also alluded to unspecified statements the White House had made before signing the order, which she factored into her review.\n\nMr. Trump initially responded to the letter with a post on Twitter at 7:45 p.m., complaining that the Senate\u2019s delay in confirming his cabinet nominees had resulted in leaving Ms. Yates in place.\n\nThe 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d led to a constitutional crisis that ended when Robert H. Bork, the solicitor general, acceded to Mr. Nixon\u2019s order and fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor.\n\nMs. Yates, a career prosecutor, is different because she is a holdover from the Obama administration.

Here's what the order says. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMy policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017\n\nThe Pinocchio rating has been updated in light of new information.\n\nIn justifying his controversial executive order halting travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, President Trump claimed that President Barack Obama did the same thing in 2011. But the comparison is a bit facile.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened in 2011.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe only news report that we could find that referred to a six-month ban was a 2013 ABC News article that included this line: \u201cAs a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News \u2014 even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cKentucky case\u201d refers to two Iraqis in Kentucky who in May 2011 were arrested and faced federal terrorism charges after officials discovered from an informant that Waad Ramadan Alwan, before he had been granted asylum in the United States, had constructed improvised roadside bombs in Iraq. The FBI, after examining fragments from thousands of bomb parts, found Alwan\u2019s fingerprints on a cordless phone that had been wired to detonate an improvised bomb in 2005.\n\nThe arrests caused an uproar in Congress, and the Obama administration pledged to reexamine the records of 58,000 Iraqis who had been settled in the United States. The administration also imposed new, more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees. Media reports at the time focused on how the new screening procedures had delayed visa approvals, even as the United States was preparing to end its involvement in the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cThe enhanced screening procedures have caused a logjam in regular visa admissions from Iraq, even for those who risked their lives to aid American troops and who now fear reprisals as the Obama administration winds down the U.S. military presence,\u201d the Baltimore Sun reported.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. officials acknowledged delays but were trying to speed up the process:\n\nA U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, speaking on condition he not be identified, acknowledged \u201cunfortunate delays\u201d in issuing special visas, the result of enhanced security clearance procedures, some instituted after the Kentucky arrests. But he said recent changes would speed the process.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action, the official said. And a requirement that Iraqi applicants provide an original signature on certain forms sent to the U.S. has been dropped after Iraqis complained of logistical difficulties. \u201cWe are making changes, ordered at the very highest levels, that will help shave time off the application process,\u201d the official said.\n\nAt a September 2011 congressional hearing, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano if a hold had been placed on Iraqi visa applications.\n\nCOLLINS: \u201cSo my question is, is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we\u2019re not letting into this country, people who would do us harm?\u201d NAPOLITANO: \u201cYep. Let me, if I might, answer your question two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC [National Counter Terrorism Center] databases and the Department of Defense\u2019s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused.\u201d COLLINS: \u201cThat\u2019s completed?\u201d NAPOLITANO: \u201cThat is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don\u2019t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.\u201d\n\nThe new rules were stringent, the Economist reported, and resulted in some turmoil.\n\n\u201cImmigration authorities soon began rechecking all Iraqi refugees in America, reportedly comparing fingerprints and other records with military and intelligence documents in dusty archives. About 1,000 soon-to-be immigrants in Iraq were told that they would not be allowed to board flights already booked. Some were removed from planes. Thousands more Iraqi applicants had to restart the immigration process, because their security clearances expired when the program stalled. Men must now pass five separate checks, women four, and children three.\u201d\n\nState Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012. But it\u2019s unclear that equates to an actual six-month pause in visa processing, rather than a dramatic slowdown in approvals as new rules were put in place. One news report said \u201cpace of visa approvals having slowed to a crawl,\u201d indicating some were still being approved.\n\nUpdate: Former Obama administration official Jon Finer denied that any ban in Iraqi refugee admissions was put in place under Obama. \u201cWhile the flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration\u2019s review, refugees continued to be admitted to the United States during that time, and there was not a single month in which no Iraqis arrived here,\u201d he wrote in Foreign Policy. \u201cIn other words, while there were delays in processing, there was no outright ban.\u201d\n\nAnother former official, Eric P. Schwartz, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration at the time, also told The Fact Checker that Trump\u2019s statement is false:\n\n\u201cPresident Obama never imposed a six-month ban on Iraqi processing. For several months in 2011, there was a lower level of Iraqi resettlement, as the government implemented certain security enhancements. Indeed, as we identified new and valuable opportunities to enhance screening, we did so. Nobody should object to a continual effort to identify legitimate enhancements, but it is disreputable to use that as a pretext to effectively shut down a program that is overwhelmingly safe and has enabled the United States to exercise world leadership. In any event, there was never a point during that period in which Iraqi resettlement was stopped, or banned.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference with Trump\u2019s action?\n\nFirst, Obama responded to an actual threat \u2014 the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. (Iraq, after all, was a war zone.) Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. (His staff has pointed to attacks unrelated to the countries named in his order.)\n\nSecond, Obama did not announce a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano\u2019s answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it had a policy to halt all applications. Indeed, it is now clear that no ban was put in place. Even so, the delays did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval.\n\nThird, Obama\u2019s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green-card holders, from traveling to the United States. Trump\u2019s policy is much more sweeping, though officials have appeared to pull back from barring permanent U.S. residents.\n\nWe have sought comment from the White House and from Obama administration officials and so may update this if more information becomes available. But so far this is worthy of at least Two Pinocchios.\n\nUpdate: In light of the response from Obama administration officials that there never was a point when Iraqi resettlement was stopped or banned, we are updating this ruling to Three Pinocchios. Iraqi refugee processing was slowed, in response to a specific threat, but it was not halted. The Trump White House, meanwhile, has failed to provide any evidence for its statement.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nKeep tabs on Trump\u2019s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\n1 of 36 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 How people reacted to Trump\u2019s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president\u2019s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.

For many of his supporters, preventing or delaying legal immigrants from returning to high-paid tech jobs, which they say should go to U.S.-born workers anyway, is a small price to pay for the promise of more security.\n\nThe move is already roiling the tech industry, with affected employees being urged to return to the U.S. and consult with corporate immigration experts.\n\nInternet Association President and CEO Michael Beckerman said the Internet industry is \"deeply concerned\" by Trump's order.\n\n\"While this order impacts many companies outside of the tech industry, Internet companies in particular thrive in the U.S. because the best and the brightest are able to create innovative products and services right here in America,\" Beckerman said in an emailed statement. \"While we support President Trump\u2019s efforts to grow our economy and allow \u2018people of great talent\u2019 to come into the U.S., the executive order signed yesterday has troubling consequences.\"\n\nThe ban includes green card holders who are authorized to live and work in the United States, according to a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Reuters reported. Some immigrants with legal visas trying to return to the U.S. from trips abroad were also detained, according to news reports.\n\nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting.

E (Photo: Albin Lohr-Jones / POOL, EPA)\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook was in Washington, D.C., where he has been meeting with GOP lawmakers and with Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nIn a memo to employees, he said \"it is not a policy we support.\"\n\n\"In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I\u2019ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration \u2014 both to our company and to our nation\u2019s future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,\" Cook wrote, according to a memo sent to employees worldwide and obtained by USA TODAY. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\nBox: Looking at how to fight this legally\n\nFor Box CEO Aaron Levie, the Trump order also hit home. One of the founders of the cloud-based storage and services company is Iranian-American and Box is currently trying to assess how many of its employees are affected.\n\n\"At the corporate level, we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now,\" Levie said. \"We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process.\"\n\nMore broadly, the order sends \"the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country,\" Levie said, turning away refugees and doing nothing to make Americans safer. \"It's very unfortunate and very disappointing,\" he said.\n\nSlack CEO Stewart Butterfield also condemned the immigration ban.\n\nMy grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister.

Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers\u2014if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.\"\n\nPast tensions\n\nImmigrants account for a significant part of the workforce in the tech industry, which has for years advocated loosening laws to increase the flow of skilled immigrants into the U.S. With its heavy reliance on the H-1B visa program that allows software engineers and other skilled workers to work in the U.S., Silicon Valley fears what immigration restrictions will come from the Trump administration.\n\nTrump's perspective on immigrants, and Muslims in particular, has caused tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley. Tech executives and workers have denounced the president's anti-Muslim views and some have pledged not to help build Trump's proposed Muslim registry.\n\nOn Saturday, Chesky pushed back against Trump's executive order in a tweet. \"Open doors brings all of U.S. together. Closing doors further divides U.S.,\" he wrote. \"Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, he offered free housing, even providing his personal email address. \"We have 3M homes, so we can definitely find people a place to stay,\" he write.\n\nThiel in focus again\n\nSome in Silicon Valley have direct ties to the Trump administration. Peter Thiel, a Trump transition team member, sits on the board of Facebook and he's a part-time partner at Y Combinator. He's an investor in many companies including Airbnb.\n\nA Facebook employee of Middle Eastern descent told BuzzFeed News that some Facebook employees want the company to \"clarify\" its relationship with Thiel.\n\n\u201cThere are questions here that we want answered. Does Thiel support this ban?\" the person said. \"Does he think the Facebook employees who come from Iran and those other countries shouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep working here? We deserve to know his position on this.\u201d\n\nUber's Kalanick said his policy is to engage with Trump.\n\n\"We partner around the world optimistically in the belief that by speaking up and engaging we can make a difference. Our experience is that not doing so shortchanges cities and the people who live in them. This is why I agreed in early December to join President Trump\u2019s economic advisory group,\" he told employees. \"I understand that many people internally and externally may not agree with that decision, and that\u2019s OK. It's the magic of living in America that people are free to disagree.\"\n\nThe growing number of public statements from technology leaders was unusual, a measure of the perceived threat to their businesses and to their own political beliefs.\n\n\"As a tech leader and public CEO, I\u2019m often advised to stay apolitical,\" Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson wrote in a Medium post. \"But this isn\u2019t politics, I believe this is a matter of objective right and wrong. Staying silent doesn\u2019t feel like leadership to me. I encourage other leaders to consider the cost of silence.\"\n\nGoogle's Pichai was the second executive of a major tech company to speak out against Trump's immigration order. Earlier Friday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was concerned about the immigration order's reach.\n\n\"Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Facebook said: \"We are assessing the impact on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.\"\n\nTrump's stance on immigration was one of the key reasons the tech industry widely opposed Trump's candidacy. Many of tech's most successful companies have been founded or are run by immigrants, and the industry employs thousands of immigrants, often from Asian countries.\n\nAfter Trump's win, tech executives from Google, Facebook, Amazon and others met with the president-elect in a summit seen as a pragmatic move to find some common ground with the new administration. Tech leaders were largely silent as Trump has rapidly signed orders in his first week in office.\n\nThat changed later in the week. Facebook COO and and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg also broke her silence, taking to Facebook to criticize the order that would bar funding to overseas healthcare providers that give abortion counseling.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jAUeGl", "image":

Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nScalia, a conservative associate justice of the Supreme Court, died last year.\n\n\u201cLife is winning again in America,\u201d said Pence, who added that Trump asked him to speak at the rally. \u201cThat is evident in...the historic election of a president...who I proudly say stands for the right to life.\u201d\n\nPence was the first U.S. vice president to address the march in its history.\n\nBundled against a stiff wind, marchers from around the country first descended on the northeast grounds of the monument.\n\nPence, who has called himself an \u201cevangelical Catholic,\u201d has long been a hero among antiabortion activists and as governor of Indiana signed what was considered some of the strictest laws on abortion.\n\nAlso addressing the crowd was key Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway.\n\n\u201cI am a wife, a mother, a Catholic, counselor to the president of the United States of America and, yes, I am pro-life,\u201d she said.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThis is a new day, a new dawn, for life,\u201d she said.\n\nThe right to life \u201cis not a privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cIts is not a choice. It is God-given...This is a time of incredible promise for the pro-life, pro-adoption movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hear you,\u201d she told the crowd, which earlier had been chanting, \u201cKell-ee-anne! Kell-ee-anne!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe respect you. And we look forward to working with you.\u201d\n\n[March for Life will have a new mood this year: Optimistic]\n\nThis year, organizers hoped to see a surge of energy with the ascension of a president who is expected to move forward on antiabortion policies, including defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing an antiabortion Supreme Court justice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pro-life,\u201d Lynn Ray, coordinator of campus ministry at the Louisiana State University at Alexandria, said Friday as she stood on Constitution Avenue with a group from the university. \u201cSo that\u2019s good for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing that we\u2019re Catholics, we\u2019re very pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery step we take, we take for an unborn baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not persecuting anyone, of course, just marching for the babies.\u201d\n\nMadeline Runyan, 22, a senior at LSU, said she, too, was pleased with President Trump\u2019s stance on abortion. \u201cI\u2019m very confident in what he\u2019s doing to help this cause,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited and optimistic.\u201d\n\n[Follow our live coverage of the March for Life here ]\n\nThe rally began at around 11:45 a.m. Pence spoke shortly after noon. The march began at around 1 p.m., and the crowd moved east, past the Capitol, and toward the Supreme Court, where another large assembly had already gathered.\n\nThere were members of the clergy, as well as \u201cBikers for Life.\u201d\n\nMany marchers were in school and church groups, carrying flags, banners, posters \u2014 and a life-size cutout of Pope Francis. They sang, chanted and prayed. The vast majority was white.\n\nDan Kehoe didn\u2019t see the march as a political statement, but a religious one.\n\nThe 34-year-old from Taos, Mo., was a chaperone on his daughter\u2019s eighth-grade Catholic Church trip. They took a Greyhound bus for 22 hours for what they called a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to Washington.\n\nHe saw news coverage of last week\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington and thought that was a political march about women\u2019s issues. This, he said, is \u201ccompletely different,\u201d and is not about women\u2019s rights, but human ones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a woman\u2019s choice, it takes two to make a child,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 200 people made the trip from his central Missouri church community with him, most of them children. He said he voted for Donald Trump, and is happy with his presidents performance so far.\n\n\u201cIf the younger generation doesn\u2019t speak up now, who will?\u201d\n\nLarge groups are common at the march, characterized by matching hats or shirts.\n\nOne block-long mass of 200 teenagers from 15 churches and three Catholic high schools filled five charter buses, but was only part of a 500-strong group from the Archdiocese of Mobile, Ala.\n\n\u201cRemember, we are guests in this city and we\u2019re going to be respectful,\u201d called Adam Ganucheau, 30, has he and other youth leaders handed out 200 boxes Subway sandwiches. \u201cWe are pilgrims; we do not litter.\u201d\n\nThe size of the group is typical, said Ganucheau, who has attended more than a dozen of these marches since 2001. But he senses an extra electricity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s historic that these kids will be able to say they heard and saw the vice president,\u201d he said as the throng began to move, sandwiches in hand.\n\nGanucheau said he was glad to have an antiabortion administration take office, although there are parts of the Trump agenda that concern him.\n\nIn addition to opposing abortion, Ganucheau said his faith also led him to support equal wages, equal pay, a welcoming immigration posture and other progressive social causes.\n\n\u201cBeing Catholic is more than being conservative or liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe in treating all people with respect.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, listed her four demands for Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress:\n\n\u25cf Appoint an antiabortion justice to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u25cf Make the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for many abortions in the United States, into a permanent law rather than the one-year provision that has been extended each year from 1976 to the present.\n\n\u25cf Pass a law banning abortion nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\u25cf Stop all federal funding for Planned Parenthood unless the organization were to somehow stop performing abortions.\n\n[Antiabortion advocates and the Women\u2019s March on Washington]\n\nThe gathering came a week after Trump\u2019s inauguration and followed last Saturday\u2019s vast Women\u2019s March on Washington.\n\nAsked about the Women\u2019s March, Ray, of Deville, La., said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all about women\u2019s rights, except when it comes to the baby. I believe \u2014 it\u2019s my opinion \u2014 but I believe a baby is a gift from God, and once the baby is a gift from God, it\u2019s no longer your body, but there\u2019s another body within. And that body has a right also.\u201d\n\nWhen march attendee Brianna Roberts, 21, of Reading, Pa., met her birthmother two years ago, she was upset to hear that relatives wanted the woman to abort her.\n\nHer mother was 20, already had one child, and was getting by on food stamps, Roberts said. But when her mother went to a clinic seeking an abortion, she was told she was too far along for the clinic to perform one.\n\nHer birthmother placed Roberts for adoption. \u201cShe did the right and responsible thing,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nRoberts said she did not vote because she didn\u2019t like either Trump or Clinton, but she is optimistic that Trump will advance anti-abortion policies.\n\n\u201cI thought this was going to be a really big year for policy change,\u201d she said.\n\nFrancis Leung, 18, a college student from Naples, Fla., said he has attended the March for Life with his parents almost every year since \u201cI was a little kid\u201d in a stroller.\n\nNow, at 18, six feet tall and a college freshman, he stood in the throng of demonstrators and grinned, saying, \u201cI always look forward to it.\u201d\n\nLeung said he grew up in a devoutly Catholic family and has been hearing a strong anti-abortion message from his parents for as long as he can remember. His nine siblings -- eight of whom came to Washington with him this week -- have heard it, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great movement, because it\u2019s simple,\u201d said Leung, a student at Ave Maria University in Florida. He was referring to the annual the March for Life. It\u2019s simple, he said, because \u201cevery unborn child has a right to life.\u201d\n\nLike his brothers and sisters, Leung said, he was home-schooled. And a central theme of his education was this: \u201cWhen two humans come together and produce a child, when they create a baby, that\u2019s like, really, really big -- it\u2019s the most important thing in the world. Procreation. It\u2019s what human beings were put on Earth to do.\u201d\n\nThe first March for Life was held one year after the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that recognized a right to abortion nationwide. Subsequent marches have been held on or near the Jan. 22 anniversary every year since.\n\nOn Friday, the marchers chanted, \u201cHey, hey, ho ho, Roe v Wade has got to go!\u201d\n\nNationwide, 59 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the highest percentage since 1996, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center .\n\nMichael E.

This piece will be updated to reflect any new orders signed.\n\n(CNN) With the flick of a pen, a new president can undo years of work by a previous administration through his constitutional \"executive powers.\"\n\nSince relocating to the White House last Friday, President Donald Trump has signed a number of executive actions, including executive orders and presidential memoranda, aimed both at fulfilling his campaign promises and at rolling back the policies of former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"We do not need new laws,\" Trump said soon after signing the two executive orders related to immigration on Wednesday, indicating he'll test the existing framework.\n\nHere's a look at both the orders and memoranda he has signed so far.\n\nTrump's first week of executive orders\n\nAn executive order is a legally binding document that declares government policy. Unable to reverse a law passed by Congress, it is more often used to delegate and direct government agencies and departments.\n\nSince taking the inaugural oath, Trump has signed four executive orders.\n\nDay 1: Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal\n\nHours after taking the oath of office, Trump issued an executive order aimed at rolling back Obamacare . The directive called on the secretary of health and human services, in addition to other agencies, to interpret regulations as loosely as possible to minimize the financial burden on individuals, insurers, health care providers and others.\n\nWho will it affect? The order's language is somewhat vague, and considering that Obamacare was passed through Congress, this presidential action can't change the law. The process of changing the law is underway, however. The House of Representatives recently approved a budget that would allow Congress to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act and congressional Republicans and the White House are scrambling to develop a replacement. Trump hopes to replace it with his own administration's health care law. All of that means this executive order's implications are unknown.\n\nDay 4: Expediting environmental reviews and approvals for high-profile infrastructure projects\n\nTrump directed those in charge of evaluating the environmental impact of infrastructure projects to return their assessments in a more timelier manner.\n\nWho will it affect? Trump promised to make new spending on infrastructure projects a priority of his administration. He needs Congress to approve any new spending bill, but this order could help expedite certain projects.\n\nDay 6: Border security and immigration enforcement improvements\n\nFulfilling another of his campaign promises, Trump instructed the Department of Homeland Security to commence immediate construction of a 1,900-mile long wall along the southern border with Mexico, using existing federal funds to get it started. The directive also signaled beefing up the border with and additional 5,000 border protection officers.\n\nWho will it affect? It's unclear where the funds for building the wall will come from . Congress would need to approve any new funding for both the wall. Some of the land is privately owned, which could prove another hurdle. But it could potentially bring more jobs and a financial injection to the economy of the border regions once construction begins and with the introduction of more border agents. More officers would also probably mean more deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nDay 6: Enhancing public safety in the Interior of the US\n\nThis executive order aims to tackle the issue of undocumented immigrants through deportation and tripling resources for enforcement with 10,000 additional immigration officers. It also targets so-called \"sanctuary cities\" -- municipalities, states and other entities which can refuse to turn over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities through a variety of shielding policies -- by withholding funding.\n\nWho will it affect? Again, this order would likely see an increase in the number of undocumented immigrants being deported. And while the administration can't cut off all federal funding, as Congress pays out much of it, the President could put pressure on cities to comply.\n\nDay 7: Protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry\n\nThis executive order prevents refugees from entering the country for 120 days and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations out for three months.\n\nWho will it affect? The countries directly affected are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. This is the \"extreme vetting\" Trump promised during the campaign, but caught the world by surprise. It set off widespread chaos and confusion at airports and for agencies tasked with implementing it.\n\nDay 9: Ethics commitments by executive branch appointees\n\nDesigned to give teeth to Trump's campaign pledge to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, the order imposes a lifetime ban on administration officials lobbying for foreign governments, and a five-year ban for other lobbying. Officials also have to pledge they \"will not for a period of 2 years from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.\"\n\nWho will it affect? Some cabinet picks will likely have to submit new ethics agreements if they have financial ties with companies affected by the actions of their departments. They will now have to agree to a two-year moratorium, instead of the original one year.\n\nDay 11: Reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costs\n\nAccording to the order, when a new regulation is disseminated, at least two existing regulations should be identified for removal \"and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\" It says that for fiscal year 2017, \"the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero.\"\n\nWho will it affect? This order immediately affects the administration's departments and agencies. However, Trump says it will help small businesses get back on track by reducing the number of regulatory hurdles a start-up has to jump to get off the ground.\n\nTrump's presidential memoranda\n\nIn addition to the executive orders, Trump signed eight presidential memoranda, which have less legal weight than an executive order and are more important as documents laying out the priorities of his administration. They can have real consequences, however.\n\nDay 1:\n\n1. Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies -- -- An order to halt any new federal regulations until they can be reviewed by the new administration. Actually rolling back regulations the Obama administration put in place will take time and a bureaucratic process. This was a near exact replica of executive orders that the past two presidents have had their chiefs of staff issue at the beginning of their administrations.\n\nDay 3:\n\n3. Regarding Withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement -- -- Withdraws the US from a massive trade deal that was negotiated by the Obama administration, but not yet ratified by Congress . It was largely a symbolic move since the TPP was never officially enacted.\n\n4. Regarding the Hiring Freeze -- -- Institutes a freeze on the hiring of new federal workers, except for the military. It contains wide exemptions for jobs \"necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities,\" which is a broad definition. It also exempts military hiring, which accounts for a third of federal jobs.\n\nDay 4:\n\n5. Construction of American Pipelines - Says new pipelines should be made using US-produced materials.\n\n6. Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline -- -- Kick starts a pipeline the Obama administration had quashed. Trump's order allows the pipelines to proceed but the projects are still a long way from getting underway. Trump himself said the US would renegotiate the terms of the pipelines, which implies a lengthy process with several competing interests.\n\nDay 8:\n\n9. Rebuilding the US Armed Forces -- spurs --spurs military spending and directs Defense Secretary James Mattis to begin \"developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources and new tools for our men and women in uniform.\"\n\nDay 9:\n\n10: Plan to Defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria -- President Trump orders a new plan to defeat ISIS to be drawn up within 30 days. It will include mechanisms to cut off all of the terror group's funding, including sale of oil and historical artifacts.\n\n11: Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council -- Elevates the President's chief strategist, -- Elevates the President's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon , to full membership of the NSC and downgrades the roles of Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who \"shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\"\n\nOne week in: Who signed more -- Trump or Obama?\n\nTrump is the latest in a long line of incoming commanders-in-chief flexing their executive muscles the first week on the job. Presidents, going all the way back to George Washington, have often taken unilateral steps to skirt past adverse lawmakers and bypass Congress -- some more than others.\n\nGetting straight to business on Inauguration Day, Trump immediately signed an order instructing federal agencies to weaken Obamacare .

(\u201cThis was irresponsible and reckless,\u201d Spicer pronounced on Miller\u2019s honest mistake.)\n\nStepping out of his spokesman role to act as editor, Spicer instructed the assembled reporters that they should have instead spotlighted how Senate Democrats were \"playing politics with national security\" in their unwillingness to immediately confirm CIA director-designate Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you guys should be writing and covering, instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives,\u201d Spicer declared. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold the press accountable as well,\u201d he added.\n\nThen he stormed out of the briefing room without taking questions.\n\nFournier\u2019s condemnation of Spicer\u2019s performance\u2014which included counterfactual exaggerations about the size of the inauguration crowd and television audience, as well as an embarrassing mispronunciation of the name of Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whom Spicer erroneously called \u201cprime minister\u201d and \u201cPe\u00f1a Nato\u201d\u2014echoed near-universal denunciations from members of the press corps and political establishment of both parties.\n\n\"Jaw meet floor,\" New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush tweeted, according to a roundup of reactions assembled by CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

And you know the President is watching.\"\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, wrote: \"Sean Spicer lacks the guts or integrity to refuse orders to go out and lie. He is a failure in this job on his first full day.\"\n\nAnd neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol, a former top White House aide for Bush 41 as Vice President Dan Quayle\u2019s chief of staff, remarked that \"it is embarrassing, as an American, to watch this briefing by Sean Spicer from the podium at the White House. Not the RNC. The White House.\"\n\nThe 45th president\u2014who spent the campaign insulting the reporters covering him as \u201cscum,\u201d \u201cdishonest,\u201d and \u201cthe lowest form of life\u201d\u2014is clearly not changing his stripes now that he\u2019s the most powerful human on the planet. And Spicer, apparently goaded by his bosses, is proving himself equally capable of misplaced rage and indignation.\n\nDuring a visit with CIA employees at the agency\u2019s Langley, Virginia, headquarters Saturday afternoon, the president went on an extended rant concerning what he called his \u201crunning war with the media,\u201d whom he described as \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community,\u201d Trump complained\u2014as though none of the hundreds of CIA employees in the room would remember that barely a week ago, he bitterly blamed the intelligence community for the leak of a scandalous unverified dossier alleging his misbehavior during a trip to Moscow, or that he repeatedly compared the intelligence community to Nazi Germany.\n\nAstonishingly, while standing in front of a memorial wall honoring 117 CIA officers who gave their lives for their country, the president also and singled out Time\u2019s Zeke Miller for special attention.\n\nNoting that he had been featured on Time\u2019s cover \u201clike, 14 or 15 times\u2014I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time magazine,\u201d the commander in chief went on, according to the official White House transcript: \u201cThey said\u2014it was very interesting\u2014that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But there was a cameraman that was in front of it\u2026So Zeke\u2014Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down. I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But this is how dishonest the media is.\u201d\n\nAfterward, a spokesman for Obama\u2019s just-departed CIA director John Brennan issued a furious blast at the president: \"Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself.\"\n\nFournier, for his part, said Spicer\u2019s defilement of the truth, and that of his boss, has broken new ground in modern presidential communications.", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2017/01/22/trump-administration-starts-with-big-lie-over-small-thing/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1485121378067.cached.jpg", "title": "Trump Administration Starts With Big Lie Over Small Thing", "summary": "The White House.\nIt doesn\u2019t look good, and \u201cmarriage\u201d is probably the last way one would describe the dysfunctional relationship between the brand-new president and the White House press corps.\nFormer White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who served President George W.

Eat leafy greens. Exercise regularly. Make time to connect with friends and family. Floss. (Though you may be off the hook for that last one.)\n\nHere is another to add to the list \u2014 you also need to feel like you\u2019re connected to something larger than yourself. This is, on the one hand, a thoroughly obvious point, one that exists at the heart of both ancient religions and modern social-justice movements. But like eating healthy foods and exercising, it\u2019s one thing to know you should do something; it\u2019s often quite another to actually do that thing. Also like eating healthy foods and exercising: This is necessary. This is nonnegotiable. To be a fully functioning human being, you have to, research in behavioral science overwhelmingly shows, feel like you\u2019re a part of something that\u2019s bigger than just you.\n\nIn his book The Happiness Hypothesis, NYU social psychologist Jonathan Haidt identifies three major themes of a fulfilling life. \u201cJust as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger,\u201d Haidt wrote. On his website, Haidt expanded on that point:\n\n[W]e are, in a way, like bees: our lives only make full sense as members of a larger hive, or as cells in a larger body. Yet in our modern way of living we\u2019ve busted out of the hive and flown out on our own, each one of us free to live as we please. Is it any wonder so many people ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d or \u201cwhat is the meaning of life?\u201d Most of us need to be part of a hive in some way, ideally a hive that has a clearly noble purpose. Religion, teaching, science, political campaigns \u2026 these are some of the hives people seek to merge themselves into. The self is often a problem; find ways to lose yours, rather than constantly celebrating or expressing it.\n\nOne easy way to meet this need this weekend: Join a march. After that, join a cause. \u201cJoin an organization that has a noble purpose and a long and noble past,\u201d Haidt writes. \u201cAny volunteer work can take you out of yourself. But one that has history, traditions, and rituals is an easier place to find \u2018vital engagement,\u2019\u201d his term for the crucial relationship that exists between a person and their surroundings.\u201cIt is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself,\u201d he writes in his book. \u201cIf you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\u201d All in all, the pursuit of meaning seems like a good theme for 2017.", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/science/2017/01/20/20-trump-protestors.w1200.h630.jpg", "title": "The Psychological Importance of Joining a March This Weekend -- Science of Us", "summary": "\u201cJoin an organization that has a noble purpose and a long and noble past,\u201d Haidt writes.\n\u201cJust as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger,\u201d Haidt wrote.\n)Here is another to add to the list \u2014 you also need to feel like you\u2019re connected to something larger than yourself.\nReligion, teaching, science, political campaigns \u2026 these are some of the hives people seek to merge themselves into.\nOne easy way to meet this need this weekend: Join a march.", "source": "New York Magazine", "bias": "Bias: Left", "authors": ["Melissa Dahl"], "keywords": ["noble", "life", "work", "importance", "science", "larger", "hive", "psychological", "meaning", "purpose", "way", "haidt", "need", "weekend", "joining"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2017-01-20 00:00:00", "url": "http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/01/20/donald-trump-inaugural-address-video-clips-quotes-highlights", "text": "", "image": "http://insider.foxnews.com/sites/insider.foxnews.com/files/styles/780/public/012017_address.jpg?itok=tEPSvzAT", "title": "'You Will Never Be Ignored Again': President Trump Gives Inaugural Address", "summary": "", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["ignored", "trump", "inaugural", "address", "president", "gives"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2017-01-20 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/donald-trump-inauguration-highlights/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to drain power from Washington elites and always put \"America first\" in its dealings with the world at a moment of transformative political change.\n\nHe arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p.m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation's capital.\n\nIn a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. As light rain began to fall on a crowd stretching toward the Washington Monument, Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts with the new first lady, Melania, by his side.\n\nTrump's inaugural address centered on the themes that animated his stunning outsider campaign, which shattered political conventions and gave voice to heartland voters who felt badly let down by professional politicians.\n\nThough he paid tribute to outgoing President Barack Obama, the President sketched a vision of America that came across as a repudiation of the last administration. He promised to restore the nation's strength and purpose and to rebuild it from within, vowing to \"bring back\" American jobs, borders, wealth and dreams.\n\n\"We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power,\" Trump said. \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it's going to be only 'America first! America first!'\"\n\nTrump: 'You will never be ignored again'\n\nTrump talked of a nation of mothers and children trapped in poverty in the inner cities and \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones,\" and warned crime and gangs had robbed the nation of much of its potential.\n\n\"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" Trump said, with Obama looking on.\n\n\"A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions,\" Trump said, emphasizing that whether people are black or white they still bleed the same red blood of patriots.\n\nJUST WATCHED Moments from Pres.

He later recognized her during a congressional lunch, when she received a standing ovation.\n\n\"I was very honored, very, very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today, I think it is appropriate to say it,\" Trump said. \"Honestly, there is nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people.\"\n\nMany traditions\n\nThe swearing-in was one of many traditions that began Friday morning. Trump and his family attended a private worship service at St. John's Episcopal Church, known as the church of presidents. The Obamas greeted Trump and the new first lady at the North Portico of the White House before hosting them for tea.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Obama wrote a letter to Trump and left it on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, as outgoing presidents typically do for their successors. As Obama left the Oval Office for the final time, he was asked whether he had any words for the American people. \"Thank you,\" Obama responded.\n\nJUST WATCHED President Obama leaves Oval Office Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Obama leaves Oval Office 02:00\n\nThe customs and symbolism that are playing out -- from Trump's ride to the Capitol with Obama to the first couple's dance at an inaugural ball -- are familiar. But the circumstances of this inauguration -- the 58th in the nation's history -- could hardly be more unconventional.\n\nWhen the presidential primary season began nearly a year ago, few thought Trump could survive the battle for the Republican nomination -- much less beat Clinton to win the presidency. He was the oldest president sworn in for a first term and the first president with no previous diplomatic, political or military executive experience.\n\nIn what is always a poignant moment, the former President Obama and his wife left Capitol Hill on a helicopter bound for Joint Base Andrews for a farewell ceremony before taking one last flight on the presidential jet. The Obamas are heading to Palm Springs, California, for a vacation.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump, Obama depart inaugural ceremony Replay More Videos ...

Halfway along Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump's vehicle stopped and the new first couple walked hand in hand past the cheering crowds. By the time the motorcade approached the new Trump hotel, the President was back in the hulking car.\n\nIn the evening, Trump and the new first lady will attend two inaugural balls, part of the stripped-down inaugural festivities that aides say are meant to stress that the new president is eager to get to work.\n\nSupporters excited; others concerned\n\nTrump's supporters, who sent him to Washington to rip up political norms and thwart the establishment, are thrilled as he assumes power. The crowds started streaming toward the National Mall as dawn broke, with many people wearing Trump's distinctive red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball caps.\n\nBut millions of Americans are also anxious, owing to the abrasive tone of Trump's campaign and fears over the consequences of his strongman leadership style.\n\nTrump has vowed to tear up US trade deals that he says disadvantage US workers, confront a rising China and improve estranged relations with Russia, despite allegations that Moscow interfered in the election. He has set high expectations for his presidency by promising to return jobs to US shores and reviving the manufacturing industry. He has pledged to crush ISIS and introduce tough new vetting on immigrants from countries where there is terrorist activity, raising fears of discrimination against Muslims.\n\nTrump is promising to build a wall on the southern border, to crack down on undocumented migrants and to gut the financial and environmental regulations that are at the center of the Obama administration's legacy.\n\nNew presidents typically use the inaugural address -- viewed by a huge crowd fanned out on the National Mall and millions of television viewers -- to issue a call for national unity and ease the wounds of divisive elections. They typically remind Americans of the values and the history that binds them and of the nation's historic mission.\n\nTrump, so far, has done little to reach out to his foes since November.\n\n\"He is still talking as if he is the insurgent candidate rather than the President-elect,\" said Robert Rowland, an expert on presidential rhetoric at the University of Kansas. \"Historically, presidents who are effective use inaugural addresses to heal the wounds of the campaign, to talk about what it means to be an American, to discuss shared values and lay out their political principles to come across as a strong not vain leader.\"", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170119172705-donald-trump-melania-01-19-super-tease.jpg", "title": "Inauguration Day 2017: Historic moment arrives", "summary": "Trump's inaugural address 02:08And he told Americans listening to the address: \"You will never be ignored again.\nJUST WATCHED Trump, Obama depart inaugural ceremony Replay More Videos ...

Trump is a category all by himself.\u201d\n\nOne factor making it easier for Trump\u2019s nominees to prevail in the GOP-controlled Senate is a 2013 rule change \u2014 ironically, one that was engineered over Republican objections by the Democrats who were then in the majority. It ended the ability of senators to filibuster Cabinet nominees, which means that nominees can be confirmed with 51 votes. There are 52 Republicans in the chamber.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s different now is that [blocking a nominee] is going to require Republicans to stand up to their own president,\u201d said Jim Manley, a longtime aide to former minority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to happen. So far, it seems like everyone is afraid of getting on the wrong side of a tweet storm.\u201d\n\nIn several instances, when controversy has erupted around Trump\u2019s appointees, the initial reaction of the president-elect and his team has been to counterattack.\n\nThat was the case when plagiarism charges surfaced against conservative pundit Monica Crowley, whom Trump had named senior director of strategic communications at the National Security Council.\n\n\u201cAny attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing the country,\u201d the presidential transition team said in a statement.\n\nBut more evidence accumulated until Crowley announced Monday that she would relinquish the post \u201cafter much reflection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe team thought itself immune from the political laws of gravity,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University. \u201cThe Crowley case showed they\u2019re not immune. We\u2019ll see what happens with these other cases.\u201d\n\nQuestions are growing most rapidly around Price, whose investments, Schumer said, appear to show \u201ca clear and troubling pattern.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are also complaining that Senate GOP leaders are trying to rush hearings for some nominees, including a rare evening hearing on Tuesday for Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s choice for education secretary.\n\nSchumer noted that some hearings have had very little seating for the general public and that others have been held before a nominee\u2019s required ethics background check was completed.\n\nIncoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday: \u201cA lot of this is Senate Democrats doing what they can to find stall tactics.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s nominees are also coming under criticism for lacking a depth in their knowledge of the policy areas that are the purview of the Cabinet departments they will run.\n\nBillionaire school choice activist DeVos, for instance, was widely ridiculed for answering a Democratic question about whether it is proper to have guns in school by saying firearms may be needed in places like Wyoming to protect against grizzly bears.\n\n[Six astonishing things Betsy DeVos said \u2014 and refused to say \u2014 at her confirmation hearing]\n\nShe also argued that states should have the right to decide whether to enforce the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. When told that the act is a federal civil rights law, DeVos said: \u201cI may have confused it.\u201d\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, was asked what level of lead consumption would be acceptable for children \u2014 a question related to the water crisis in Flint, Mich.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I have not reviewed nor know about. I would be concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water, or obviously human consumption,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cBut I have not looked at the scientific research.\u201d\n\nPublic health officials have long said there is no safe level of lead, especially for children.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News Channel on Wednesday morning, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the performance of Trump\u2019s nominees and accused Democrats of attempting to score political points.\n\n\u201cThe idea of humiliating and trying to embarrass qualified men and women who just wish to serve this nation is reprehensible,\u201d Conway said.\n\nValerie Strauss contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/18/National-Politics/Images/HEARINGS004.JPG", "title": "Trump Cabinet nominees meet growing ethical questions", "summary": "It ended the ability of senators to filibuster Cabinet nominees, which means that nominees can be confirmed with 51 votes.\nThree of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks came under growing fire Wednesday on ethical issues, potentially jeopardizing their nominations.\nBut it is far from certain \u2014 or even likely \u2014 that any of Trump\u2019s nominees will buckle under the political pressure.\nDuring an appearance on Fox News Channel on Wednesday morning, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the performance of Trump\u2019s nominees and accused Democrats of attempting to score political points.\n\u201cIf failure to pay taxes was disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should be true for Republican nominees,\u201d Schumer said.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Ed O Keefe Is A Congressional Reporter Who Has Covered Congressional Presidential Politics Since He Previously Covered Federal Agencies The Federal Workforce Spent A Brief Time Covering The War In Iraq Follow Edatpost", "Karen Tumulty Is A National Political Correspondent For The Washington Post", "John Wagner Is A National Political Reporter Covering The White House"], "keywords": ["ethical", "hearings", "trump", "nominee", "senate", "pay", "administration", "cabinet", "nominees", "trumps", "questions", "team", "growing", "meet"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-23 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/23/13731448/obama-pardon-clemency-commutation", "text": "A day before leaving office, President Barack Obama broke one of his own records. By using the president\u2019s pardon powers and shortening the prison sentences of 330 prison inmates convicted of drug crimes, he made Thursday the biggest use of clemency by a president in a single day in US history \u2014 breaking a record he himself set earlier in the week.\n\nIt\u2019s the culmination of a year-long effort to use the president\u2019s clemency power to get hundreds of people \u2014 most of them nonviolent drug offenders \u2014 out of prison sooner. And it tops off another presidential record: With 1,927 people granted some form of clemency, Obama has used his clemency powers more than any president since Harry Truman (excluding Gerald Ford\u2019s clemency for thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers).\n\nDepending on how you look at it, Obama\u2019s effort in the twilight of his presidency is either a historic act of criminal justice reform \u2014 or too little too late. Obama\u2019s rejected thousands of petitions for reduced sentences, and there are still thousands more waiting for review \u2014 and the Trump administration, under Attorney General\u2013nominee Jeff Sessions, is extremely unlikely to give them a second look.\n\nThe Thursday actions are the last batch of clemency approvals that Obama will grant. But while it\u2019s now clear that Obama\u2019s done something very significant indeed, it\u2019s also near-certain that it will, in some ways, fall short.\n\nObama\u2019s last-minute clemency push\n\nThe president\u2019s power of clemency \u2014 which includes both officially absolving people with criminal convictions of their crimes (pardons) and reducing sentences of people currently incarcerated (commutations) \u2014 is established in the Constitution, and it\u2019s very broad. So even though pardons and commutations are given to individual people, it\u2019s arguably the most direct tool the president has to reduce mass incarceration if he so chooses.\n\nIn the last year of his presidency, Obama has stepped up to the plate. He\u2019s used the pardon power to reduce more sentences than any other president \u2014 thanks almost entirely to his administration\u2019s actions over the past year.\n\nObama\u2019s been a critic of mass incarceration, or at least of disproportionate sentences for drug crimes (which are the most common type of crime among federal prisoners), since he came into office. But for the first several years of his presidency, he was historically stingy in using the pardon power to help prisoners he claimed were serving unfair sentences.\n\nThe change from then to now is a story of how easy it is for a single federal official to slow down a process \u2014 and how hard it is for a single official to speed it up.\n\nFor the first term of his presidency, the head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney was a \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d holdover from the George W. Bush administration. The chief pardon attorney was so resistant to pardoning federal prisoners that in at least one case he withheld relevant evidence that would have made a pardon applicant look better when presenting the application to Obama for review.\n\nIn early 2014, the Obama administration decided it would do a 180 on the pardon office \u2014 and try to use it as a way to affirmatively get people out of prison. It replaced the pardon attorney with a prisoners rights advocate, and encouraged thousands of federal prisoners who\u2019d been sentenced under now-obsolete laws or policies to apply to get their sentences reduced to current levels.\n\nThe applications came in. The approvals did not. It turned out that using the pardon power to grant big batches of commutations wasn\u2019t just a matter of who was at the head of the pardon office, but how willing Department of Justice leadership and the White House were to take risks. (When politicians are afraid that just one person they release can go on to commit another crime, it makes it hard to release anyone at all.)\n\nIn early 2016, the pardon attorney Obama had hired to oversee the commutation push quit \u2014 with a letter making it clear that she didn\u2019t feel the administration was keeping its promises on clemency. Days after her resignation, the commutations picked up. And they\u2019ve barely stopped since.\n\nThousands of prisoners are still waiting \u2014 and President Trump is unlikely to help\n\nObama didn\u2019t approve all the petitions he got. As of late December, nearly 14,000 applications for commutations (many of them submitted per the White House\u2019s 2014 request) were still pending, along with more than 2,000 applications for full pardons. And the administration had already formally denied more than 16,000 petitions.\n\nObama could have approved every one of those applications, and it would still be a drop in the mass incarceration bucket \u2014 since his actions focused mostly on drug offenders. While about half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for drug crimes, prison sentences for drugs aren\u2019t the biggest cause of mass incarceration in the US as a whole: Only about 16 percent of state prisoners, who make up about 87 percent of the overall prison population, are in for drug crimes. So a focus on reducing prison sentences for other crimes, including violent ones, is likely needed to truly end mass incarceration.\n\nAnd Obama\u2019s clemency actions only captured a fraction of federal inmates. As of 2015, there were around 92,000 federal prisoners in for drug crimes, and more than 100,000 in for other crimes \u2014 far more inmates than Obama\u2019s nearly 2,000 clemency approvals reached.\n\nEven among drug offenders, Obama has reduced fewer prison sentences than the US Sentencing Commission did by reducing the recommended baseline for federal drug prisoners \u2014 a move that has already let out thousands of prisoners before their original release dates. And by commuting sentences rather than pardoning people, the president has released ex-prisoners into a world where their criminal records can still stop them from getting jobs, public housing, or the vote.\n\nBut most people would agree being out of prison without those things is still better than being in prison without them. The thousands of people who are waiting to hear about their commutations certainly believe that. So does the Obama administration.\n\nThe Trump administration likely will not.\n\nPresident-elect Trump ran on a \u201ctough on crime\u201d platform. He indirectly attacked Obama\u2019s attempts at clemency \u2014 and by \u201cindirectly\u201d I mean \u201cexaggerated it to the point of lying,\u201d excoriating Obama for releasing \u201cthousands\u201d of \u201cviolent criminals.\u201d\n\nSessions, Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, is likewise a crime hawk. He\u2019s criticized Obama\u2019s use of the pardon power as a violation of the \u201crule of law.\u201d It\u2019s extremely unlikely that he\u2019s going to turn around, once in office, and continue a policy that he vocally opposed.\n\nSome criminal justice reformers have urged Obama to commute sentences for whole categories of prisoners, to make the biggest possible impact before turning the executive branch over to people whose views on criminal justice are so different from his own. Others have just urged him to get through the stack of applications at the pardon office quicker.\n\nObama did the second, but it didn\u2019t go in the way reformers would like \u2014 it\u2019s resulted in thousands of rejections. And it now seems clear he won\u2019t do the first.

USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nCongressional Democrats may have accepted the outcome of the election by now, but that doesn't mean they have to like it.\n\nSince December, several dozen House members have said they will not attend Donald Trump's inauguration Friday. The number of Democratic representatives multiplied after Trump insulted John Lewis, the veteran House member and civil rights leader, on Twitter.\n\nSome simply said they cannot participate in a ceremony that celebrates a president whose platforms contradict their constituents. Others said they will save their energy for the Women's March on Washington, a demonstration including women's rights activists and anti-Trump protesters, scheduled for the next day in the nation's capital.\n\nHere's a running state-by-state list of which representatives have said they are skipping out:\n\nAlabama\n\nRep. Terri Sewell said in a statement that she wouldn\u2019t attend because of the \u201cblatant disrespect shown by President-elect Trump towards American civil rights icon, my colleague, friend and mentor, the Honorable John Lewis.\u201d\n\nSewell did, however, invite Trump and Lewis to join her at the iconic Selma bridge \u201cto walk hand-in-hand across that bridge as one nation, indivisible and united.\n\nArizona\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva announced Jan. 13 from the House chamber that he would boycott the inauguration. Instead, he said, he will march back home with his constituents.\n\n\u201cMy absence is not motivated by disrespect for the office, or motivated by disrespect for the government that we have in this great democracy,\" he said, \"but as an individual act \u2013 yes, of defiance \u2013 at the disrespect shown to millions and millions of Americans by this incoming administration.\"\n\nHe reminded his peers that while Trump won the election, he lost the popular vote. Grijalva said those who voted against Trump and even those who did not vote because of dissatisfaction of both parties deserve respect.\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego also announced Jan. 17 he also would not be attending the inauguration out of protest.\n\nWe must stand against Trump's bigotries- birther conspiracies, attacks on Gold\u2b50\ufe0f parents & civil rights heroes. I won't attend inauguration. \u2014 Ruben Gallego (@RepRubenGallego) January 17, 2017\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia is the state with the largest congressional delegation and the most members avoiding the inauguration. There's Rep. Jared Huffman, who on Jan. 7 wrote on Facebook that he would not \"sit passively\" and celebrate Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I do accept the election results and support the peaceful transfer of power, but it is abundantly clear to me that with Donald Trump as our President, the United States is entering a dark and very dangerous political chapter,\" he said. \"I will do everything I can to limit the damage and the duration of this chapter, and I believe we can get through it.\"\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren made similar comments to the Los Angeles Times when she told them she wasn't attending.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee told USA TODAY that while she would attend Trump's State of the Union in the future, she would not be at the inauguration. Lee said she didn't want to participate in an event made to \u201ccelebrate and applaud\u201d Trump over the things he has said.\n\nRep. Mark DeSaulnier outlined his reasons for not attending in the following video:\n\nWhen #Trump places his hand on the Bible & takes the Oath of Office, he will in that moment, be in violation of that oath & the Constitution pic.twitter.com/mZCQrTua4R \u2014 Mark DeSaulnier (@RepDeSaulnier) January 14, 2017\n\nSeveral more House members from California decided to boycott the inauguration after Trump insulted Lewis.\n\n\"I'm not going to normalize his behavior,\" Rep. Ted Lieu told MSNBC. \"He's attacked Gold Star parents, veterans such as John McCain, Latinos, Muslim Americans and now John Lewis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Maxine Waters said she never planned on attending Trump's inauguration anyway.\n\nI never ever contemplated attending the inauguration or any activities associated w/ @realDonaldTrump. I wouldn't waste my time. \u2014 Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) January 15, 2017\n\nRep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the first Mexican-American woman elected to Congress, told Fusion, \" the disparaging remarks the President-elect has made about many groups, including women, Mexicans, and Muslims, are deeply contrary to my values. As a result, I will not be attending the Inauguration.\"\n\nRep. Karen Bass took to social media to have her constituents decide whether she should attend the inauguration. The majority of the Twitter poll's respondents said no.\n\nI want to hear directly from my constituents! Do you guys think I should attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump? \u2014 Congressmember Bass (@RepKarenBass) January 15, 2017\n\nOn Jan. 17, Bass announced she would not be attending.\n\nAfter receiving an overwhelming response on the twitter poll, I've decided not to attend the inauguration of President-elect Trump. pic.twitter.com/ig4kFn0GGH \u2014 Congressmember Bass (@RepKarenBass) January 17, 2017\n\nRep. Alan Lowenthal also said he had decided not to attend the inauguration following Trump\u2019s attacks on Lewis.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times also reported that Reps. Grace Napolitano, Raul Ruiz, Juan Vargas, Tony C\u00e1rdenas, Judy Chu, Jerry McNerney and Mark Takano won't be attending.\n\nFlorida\n\nRep. Darren Soto cited Trump's attacks on Lewis as the reason he was skipping\n\n\u201cI am deeply disappointed with Trump\u2019s attacks against civil rights hero John Lewis and will not be attending the inauguration as a result,\u201d he told WFTV 9.\n\nReps. Alcee Hastings and Fredreka Wilson have also said they will not attend.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLewis' announcement that he wouldn't attend the inauguration sparked a response from the president-elect, which prompted other House Democrats to follow suit.\n\nHe told NBC news last week, \u201cI don\u2019t see this president-elect as a legitimate president \u2026 I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected.\u201d\n\nThat's when Trump tweeted that Lewis was \"all talk\" and suggested he pay more attention to his \"crime infested\" district.\n\nKentucky\n\nJohn Yarmuth, Kentucky's lone Democratic congressman, said in a radio interview Monday that he would not attend. Trump, he said, has embarrassed the office of the president.\n\n\"After a great deal of thought, I\u2019ve decided not to attend the inauguration \u2014 partially out of deference to my friend John Lewis, who was attacked in a historically inaccurate and insulting way, but more importantly, because I thought about the fact that leading up to the election and up until this weekend, Donald Trump has consistently behaved in a way that has helped destroy a lot of the dignity of the presidency,\" Yarmuth said.\n\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share TRUMP INAUGURATION PREP Raw: Trump arrives in Washington area | 1:31 President-elect Donald Trump arrived in the Washington area Thursday ahead of his Friday inauguration.

Jos\u00e9 Serrano tweeted last week that he will not attend the ceremony. Since then, several more House members from New York have announced they will not go, including Jerry Nadler, Adriano Espaillat and Nydia Velazquez.\n\nRep.

Peter DeFazio said he usually avoids inaugurations and Friday will be no exception.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCiting the Affordable Care Act repeal, Russian hacking and Lewis, Rep. Dwight Evans tweeted that he would not attend the inauguration.\n\nRep. Mike Doyle said he also would skip the inauguration and cited Trump's attacks on Lewis in a tweet.\n\nRep. Brendan Boyle said on Facebook he couldn't celebrate something he believed \"is a grave mistake.\"\n\nTexas\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro said he'd stick around D.C. to welcome constituents who were coming for the inauguration but he wouldn't attend the event himself.\n\n\"Every American should respect the office of the presidency and the fact that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. But winning an election does not mean a man can show contempt for millions of Americans and then expect those very people to celebrate him,\" Castro said in a statement.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett said also wouldn't be attending the inauguration.\n\n\"I cannot participate in the inauguration of a person who calls women 'dogs,' \" said Rep.

She will be in Washington for an immigration roundtable Friday and for the Women's March on Saturday.\n\nRep. Adam Smith said that he also won't attend the inauguration, but it isn't anything against Trump \u2014 though he said he has plenty of issues with Trump's proposals and statements. Instead, Smith said he's skipping because \"I\u2019d prefer to be home.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time he's skipped an inauguration either; according to The Stranger he's only attended two inaugurations in the 10 terms he's been in Congress.\n\nTennessee\n\nRep. Steve Cohen told WMC Action News 5 that while he \"would love to attend the inauguration\" he wasn't going to because \"this president semi-elect does not deserve to be President of the United States. He has not exhibited the characteristics and the values that we hold dear.\"\n\nWisconsin\n\nRep. Mark Pocan, citing Russian hacking and offensive Trump tweets, said he will not be at the ceremony.\n\nAfter reading classified Russian hacking doc & @realDonaldTrump offensive tweets to @repjohnlewis I will not be attending the Inauguration. pic.twitter.com/wrEeGfqjrZ \u2014 Rep. Mark Pocan (@repmarkpocan) January 15, 2017\n\nBut there are some Democrats who say they'll be there despite their concerns about the president-elect.\n\nWisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore said she'd be at the inauguration because she wanted to be the face of resistance.\n\n\u201cI support my colleagues in their decision to boycott the Presidential Inauguration, but knowing how he operates, I suspect President-elect Donald Trump will use this expression of free speech as an excuse to bypass Democrats and to push his extreme agenda with utter impunity. With that in mind, I refuse to be a pawn in the president-elect\u2019s efforts to rally support from congressional Republicans,\" Moore said in a statement. \"As a proud Democrat, I want President-elect Trump to see me front and center as he\u2019s sworn in. I want him to see exactly what his opposition looks like. When he sees me, I want him to see The Resistance.\"\n\nTexas Rep. Gene Green said that he would be attending the inauguration and he cited the fact that Trump\u2019s general election opponent would be. \u201cI will attend the Inaugural ceremony to observe the peaceful transfer of authority in our government. I am attending for the same reasons that Secretary Clinton decided to attend \u2014 patriotism and a deep commitment to our Republic, not to endorse President-Elect Trump.\u201d\n\nBut Arizona freshman Rep.Tom O\u2019Halleran announced he'd be there and did not bring up any of Trump's past comments or proposals. Instead, the Republican-turned-Democrat cited his desire to work with \"anyone, regardless of party, to move our country forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe peaceful transfer of power from one president to another is a hallmark of our democracy,\u201d said O\u2019Halleran. \u201cI will be attending the inauguration this week, and I will maintain my open door policy to work with anyone, regardless of party, to move our country forward.\u201d\n\nContributing: The (Louisville) Courier-Journal, The (East Brunswick, N.J.)

John Lewis dominated political chatter in Washington over the weekend, highlighting questions of legitimacy and racism that Democrats hope will dog the next administration.\n\nThe fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets blasting Mr. Lewis after the Georgia Democrat said he doesn\u2019t see the Republican as a \u201clegitimate president\u201d was the lead story on every Sunday political talk show, with the Trump transition team defending the president-elect.\n\nReince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, called on President Obama to tell Democrats to stop trying to delegitimatize the election of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama could step up,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration can do a lot of good by telling folks that are on their side of the aisle, \u2018Look, we many have lost the election on the Democratic side, but it\u2019s time to come together and stop questioning legitimacy,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lewis isn\u2019t the first Democrat to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s legitimacy. But his blunt declaration in a TV interview just before Martin Luther King Jr. Day \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s forceful response on Twitter \u2014 created the perfect political storm.\n\nMr. Lewis said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that aired Saturday that the inauguration this week will be the first he will miss since his election to Congress in 1986.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, who led the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march in Selma, Alabama. \u201cI think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders have increasingly questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Trump, citing evidence that Russian hackers attempted to interfere in the election and allegations that Mr. Trump was involved.\n\nThe allegation that Mr. Trump or his associates contacted the Russians during the campaign about email hacks aimed at hurting Mrs. Clinton were in a purported Russian spy dossier, which U.S. intelligence officials and news organizations have not authenticated.\n\nMr. Trump fired back at Mr. Lewis in a series of Twitter posts, saying the congressman should focus on problems in his Atlanta district. He tweeted: \u201cAll talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump later tweeted: \u201cCongressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d\n\nDemocrats, including prominent black lawmakers such as Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s rebuttal as racist, a label critics have applied to Mr. Trump since he launched his presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cCory Booker and John Lewis are right about is to talk about the racist past of Donald Trump,\u201d Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, said on the ABC show. \u201cWe all remember that Trump was one of the leaders of the so-called birther movement trying to delegitimize the presidency of our first African-American president, Barack Obama, which is an outrage.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump later canceled a visit scheduled for Monday to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He cited scheduling conflicts, but Democratic critics said it was because of blowback from his clash with Mr. Lewis.\n\nMr. Priebus said Mr. Lewis\u2018 attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s legitimacy was \u201cinsanity, and it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Mr. Obama has publicly vouched for the legitimacy of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. He noted that he said as much in his final speech as president, referring to Mr. Trump as \u201cthe freely elected president of the United States.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. McDonough said allegations of Russian hacking and potential complicity by Mr. Trump \u201care by no means trivial concerns.\u201d\n\nMr. McDonough also said it was Mr. Trump who should be extending an olive branch to Mr. Lewis.\n\n\u201cMy hope would be that the president-elect will reach out to someone as consequential and who is such a leader as John Lewis \u2014 who has done so much in the course of his life \u2014 to try to work this out,\u201d Mr. McDonough said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat, defended Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the utmost respect for congressman Lewis. He\u2019s an icon, if you will, and we all have the most respect for him. I just think that was uncalled for,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nMr. Manchin said the divisive rhetoric was playing into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s bid to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral process.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re concerned about the Russians and we know the Russians want to be involved, Putin wants to be involved in altering our process, then he will succeed if he sees this bickering going back and forth. That\u2019s what we have to stop. We\u2019re bigger than this,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Manchin has emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s primary allies among Senate Democrats. He also sits in one of the party\u2019s most vulnerable Senate seats in 2018.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former Republican primary rivals, said Mr. Lewis\u2018 legendary activism shouldn\u2019t render him immune to criticism.\n\n\u201cI do appreciate him being a civil rights icon, but I would also say that that doesn\u2019t make us immune from criticism or debate,\u201d he said on \u201cCNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us actually want to be considered to be racially insensitive, and so it\u2019s a very, very important subject, but I think we shouldn\u2019t ignore that people are partisan,\u201d said Mr. Paul.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Bailey to produce an exhibition of animals and human oddities. Meanwhile, five brothers from the Ringling family in Wisconsin had set up their own variety act.\n\nAfter they merged, the circus spent decades touring the United States by train, transporting its iconic spectacle \u2014 along with hundreds of animals, performers and big-top tents \u2014 from city to city.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the circus had been facing mounting obstacles that even its most acrobatic members could not overcome: declining ticket sales, high operating costs and an increasingly negative public sentiment about forcing captive wild animals to perform as entertainment.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any one thing,\u201d Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, told the Associated Press. \u201cThis has been a very difficult decision for me and for the entire family.\u201d\n\nHis father, Irvin Feld, bought the circus in 1967, and it has been operated by the family-owned Feld Entertainment since. Today, the company has about 500 employees, who were informed Saturday night about the closure.\n\nKenneth Feld told the AP that it was becoming increasingly difficult to make a traveling circus viable and relevant in a world of modern entertainment.\n\n\u201cTry getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes,\u201d he added, referring to the show\u2019s 12-minute tiger act.\n\nAfter Ringling Brothers & Barnum and Bailey ended the elephant show in May, The Washington Post took an exclusive tour of the Center for Elephant Conservation to see how the circus's biggest stars were adjusting to their new home. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)\n\nRingling Bros. had also been the target of protests by animal rights groups and was involved in protracted legal battles with many of them.\n\nIn 2015, Ringling Bros. announced it would stop using elephants in its shows. The lumbering mammals delivered their final performances last May \u2014 dancing, spinning and standing on pedestals at the command of the ringmaster \u2014 and then were retired to a reserve in central Florida.\n\nThe move exacerbated the show\u2019s demise; the elephants\u2019 departure ultimately expedited what was a \u201cdifficult business decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cRingling Bros. ticket sales have been declining, but following the transition of the elephants off the road, we saw an even more dramatic drop,\u201d Kenneth Feld said in a statement Saturday. \u201cThis, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable business for the company.\u201d\n\n[The Big Exit: Elephants have been retired from the circus. Will their lives be better?]\n\nAmong animal activist groups, news of its closure Saturday was met with a resounding cheer.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States described itself as \u201clong a bitter adversary of Feld Entertainment and Ringling Bros.\u201d in its response to the news. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society, ending a 14-year fight over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants, the AP reported.\n\nA major moment as big brands that harm animals fade away and more humane businesses emerge I applaud @RinglingBros announcement. \u2014 Wayne Pacelle (@waynepacelle) January 15, 2017\n\n\u201cRingling Bros. has changed a great deal over a century and a half, but not fast enough,\u201d Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable any longer to cart wild animals from city to city and have them perform silly yet coercive stunts. I know this is bittersweet for the Feld family, but I applaud their decision to move away from an institution grounded on inherently inhumane wild animal acts.\u201d\n\nThe animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also welcomed the announcement Saturday night, calling it \u201cthe end of the saddest show on earth\u201d and demanding that other acts follow suit.\n\n\u201cAll other animal circuses, roadside zoos, and wild animal exhibitors, including marine amusement parks like SeaWorld and the Miami Seaquarium, must take note: society has changed, eyes have been opened, people know now who these animals are, and we know it is wrong to capture and exploit them,\u201d PETA said in a statement.\n\nAfter 36 years of PETA protests, which showed the world the plight of animal captivity, PETA heralds the end of the saddest show on earth. \u2014 PETA (@peta) January 15, 2017\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Elahe Izadi reported in 2015, the death in 1998 of Kenny, a 3-year-old Asian elephant with the Ringling Bros., ultimately led to complaints about and greater attention to the treatment of the circus\u2019s elephants:\n\nHe sat out a third show that day but was led into the arena to watch. Kenny died overnight in his stall. His death triggered a series of events: A whistleblower tipped off People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the group said, and it contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The agency eventually brought a complaint that charged the circus with failing to handle Kenny in a way that \u201cdid not cause behavioral stress and unnecessary discomfort\u201d and said that handlers made the young elephant perform even after discovering he was sick and needed to be seen by a veterinarian. Eventually, the USDA dropped the complaint and the circus\u2019s parent company agreed to donate $20,000 to Asian elephant organizations.\n\nLast year, California and Rhode Island moved to ban the use of the bullhook, also known as an elephant goad or ankus \u2014 a tool used to train elephants that activist groups describe as cruel and inhumane. The Rhode Island ban took effect Jan. 1. The California ban takes effect in 2018.\n\nRingling Bros. currently has two circus units: The final shows will be in Providence, R.I., on May 7, and in Uniondale, N.Y., on May 21. While the show retired its elephants last year, the circus still has a huge menagerie, including lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas, according to the Associated Press.\n\nJuliette Feld, chief operating officer for Feld Entertainment, told the AP that homes will be found for the animals but that the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida.\n\n1 of 36 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See photos of the Ringling Bros. circus elephants, after the show View Photos After retiring from \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth\u201d last Spring, are their lives better?

Before the House vote on Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cThe \u201cUnaffordable\u201d Care Act will soon be history!\u201d But they have yet to agree on a replacement plan.\n\nOn Thursday night Ryan said during a CNN town hall meeting that Congress would draft a replacement plan \u201cdefinitely within these first 100 days\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nDuring the forum Ryan was confronted by a cancer patient from Arizona who said the Affordable Care Act had saved his life and asked why Republicans would consider gutting the law without something else in place.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do that. We want to replace it with something better,\u201d Ryan said. He claimed that the healthcare law was \u201ccollapsing\u201d and said that Republicans needed to rescue Americans from soaring premiums and increasing deductibles.\n\nTrump campaigned with zeal on the promise of repealing the law on \u201cday one\u201d and replacing it with \u201csomething terrific\u201d. Beyond that, he has offered few details about his proposal.\n\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Trump said Republicans would deliver their healthcare plan to replace the law \u201cvery quickly\u201d.\n\nBut to pass a replacement plan, Republicans will have to craft a proposal that unites their party, which is deeply divided on how to move forward, as well as win over some Democrats, since they would need a 60-vote super-majority in the Senate, where they only have 52 seats.\n\nDemocrats have said they are willing to work with Republicans to improve the law but have shown no desire to rescue them over its replacement.\n\nPassing the measure is only a first step. Now lawmakers on various committees will begin drafting the legislation to replace the bill, a lengthy and exhaustive process that will take place across four committees.\n\n\u201cThis is a sad day in the history of this country as Republicans begin the process of destroying healthcare in America,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat of New York. \u201cRepeal and replace is just a slogan, it\u2019s not a solution.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, Congress approved legislation that would allow retired marine general James Mattis to become defense secretary, granting him an exemption from the law that bars former service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top job at the Pentagon. A White House spokesman said Barack Obama would sign the measure if Congress approved it before he leaves office next week.", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cceee9875364a86e549214d9c34161b905a278ef/0_274_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=70524d00f96a3ccbdc70e417bd3351d1", "title": "Congress approves initial measures to repeal Affordable Care Act", "summary": "Before the House vote on Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cThe \u201cUnaffordable\u201d Care Act will soon be history!\u201d But they have yet to agree on a replacement plan.\nWe see nothing.\u201dRepublicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010.\nHe claimed that the healthcare law was \u201ccollapsing\u201d and said that Republicans needed to rescue Americans from soaring premiums and increasing deductibles.\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Trump said Republicans would deliver their healthcare plan to replace the law \u201cvery quickly\u201d.\nRepublicans ready to dismantle Obamacare amid replacement concerns Read moreCongress has set the stage for repeal of the Affordable Care Act, approving a preliminary measure that will allow Republicans to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.", "source": "The Guardian", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "keywords": ["affordable", "initial", "replacement", "congress", "healthcare", "house", "approves", "measures", "measure", "ryan", "replace", "plan", "act", "republicans", "repeal", "law", "care"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2017-01-13 00:00:00", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2017/01/13/former-chicago-police-superintendent-the-justice-dept-results-were-political-and--predetermined-n2271138", "text": "Garry McCarthy was the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department.

He conceded that climate change is man-made and needs to be addressed by world powers \u2014 but also that there\u2019s very little he can do to control the potential global fallout of Trump\u2019s tweeting.\n\nTillerson\u2019s hearing was the marquee event on a busy day amid a consequential week for the incoming Trump administration as the president-elect\u2019s top Cabinet picks begin the confirmation process. As Tillerson testified, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, was sitting for his second day of hearings with the Judiciary Committee and Elaine L. Chao, Trump\u2019s choice for transportation secretary, testified before the Senate commerce panel.\n\nLawmakers were also keeping tabs on Trump\u2019s long-anticipated news conference in New York, his first since winning the presidency, where he conceded that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election.\n\nTillerson\u2019s sometimes testy confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave the 64-year-old Texan his first chance to address concerns that ExxonMobil put profits ahead of human rights, environmental and policy concerns, and to explain his relationship with Russia.\n\n\u201cI understand full well the responsibilities and the seriousness\u201d of the job, Tillerson said. \u201cI don\u2019t view this as a game in any way,\u201d he said, rejecting a characterization that he might view problems and policies as transactional.\n\nSharp inquiries by senators in both parties signaled that Democrats and Republicans are still skeptical about whether Tillerson is suited to be the chief U.S. diplomat alongside a president with no government experience, particularly at a time of increasingly strained relations between the United States and Russia.\n\nWith his smooth baritone voice, he assured senators that he would set aside a profit-driven worldview born of 41 years as an oil executive and would recuse himself from decisions involving his former employer, the world\u2019s largest oil company. Tillerson retired Dec. 31 and has pledged to sell his remaining ExxonMobil stock.\n\nBut Tillerson seemed constrained and at times reluctant in answering questions about some of the most controversial positions adopted by Trump during the presidential campaign. In some cases he said he does not yet have sufficient information to comment in detail, as with the Russian presidential hacking allegations clouding Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency now, and in other cases he said the incoming administration has not yet settled on its views.\n\n\u201cIn my conversations with him on the subjects we have discussed, he\u2019s been very open and inviting of my views and respectful of those views,\u201d Tillerson said of Trump. \u201cMy sense is that were going to have all the views presented on the table.\u201d\n\nTillerson called himself a pragmatist about Russia, which he said is not a friend of the United States but can be a partner. Moscow has been emboldened in Ukraine and elsewhere by a void in strong U.S. leadership, Tillerson said, and he pledged a tough stance with both Russia and China over territorial ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe have stumbled,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent decades, we have cast American leadership into doubt.\u201d\n\nHe was most critical of foreign policy decisions made by President Obama, but he also found fault with the Iraq War launched by Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nHe declined to label Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin a war criminal or to condemn Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over human rights abuses the leader himself claims he committed.\n\nHe seemed to stun some senators by saying he had not yet discussed Russian action in Aleppo, Syria, with Trump. He frustrated others by appearing to stonewall questions about ExxonMobil lobbying against economic sanctions, especially concerning Russia, where the company does extensive business.\n\nTillerson said he never lobbied on the issue and fumbled over whether ExxonMobil ever had. At one point he said that to the best of his memory, ExxonMobil had not done that.\n\nDemocrats on the committee produced lobbying records that show ExxonMobil had said it was lobbying over various economic sanctions measures, including tough sanctions on Iran in 2010 and more recently over sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea.\n\nUnder questioning by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, Tillerson did not dispute intelligence officials\u2019 findings on Russia, saying that he had reviewed the unclassified report that U.S. agencies released last week on Russian interference in the election. More detailed classified versions of that report were presented to Trump and to President Obama.\n\n\u201cThat report clearly is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described were undertaken,\u201d Tillerson said.\n\nRubio is the only Republican on the committee who has suggested he might oppose Tillerson \u2014 a move that could imperil the former executive\u2019s nomination. Any GOP resistance could endanger the nomination in the Senate, which Republicans hold with 52 seats.\n\nAs the hearing concluded, Rubio signaled he has not made up his mind.\n\n\u201cI have to make sure I\u2019m 100 percent behind whatever decision that I make, because when I make it, it isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nLate Wednesday the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, said he would need more time and research before he could vote for Tillerson. He called the nominee\u2019s answers on sanctions and human rights issues troubling and confusing and said Tillerson seemed unwilling to fully separate himself from his former employer.\n\nRubio has become a proxy for other GOP senators voicing similar concerns about Tillerson\u2019s views on Putin and Russia. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who do not sit on the panel, have indicated reluctance to vote for Tillerson, as have others. McCain said Tuesday that he had no plans to attend the proceedings but that he intended to send Tillerson written questions regarding Russia \u201cand other matters.\u201d\n\nConcerns with Tillerson\u2019s ties to Russia include that he accepted an Order of Friendship award given personally by Putin in 2013 and because he has met with the Russian leader and other senior government officials numerous times.\n\n[What is the Russian Order of Friendship, and why does Rex Tillerson have one?]\n\nTillerson appeared to break with Trump over the whether Russia was justified in annexing the Crimea region of Ukraine, the value of an international climate agreement and the wisdom of expanding the number of countries that possess nuclear weapons, among other issues.\n\nHe also appeared to depart from the president he would serve in support for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and rejection of any \u201cblanket\u201d ban on Muslim immigration or registry.\n\nTillerson hedged on his views on the human role in climate change and the extent of the threat it poses, although he did say he thinks the United States is better served by remaining a party to the international agreement on climate change brokered under the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d U.S. participation in the accord, in which hundreds of countries collectively agreed to slash carbon emissions to help mitigate the effects of global warming.\n\nUnder clipped questioning about Trump\u2019s business dealings and Exxon\u2019s views on climate science from Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who was the Democratic nominee for vice president in the 2016 election, Tillerson repeatedly answered \u201cI have no knowledge.\u201d\n\nKaine asked whether the response came from a lack of knowledge or a refusal to answer; Tillerson said with a smile, \u201ca little of both.\u201d\n\nTillerson flashed his blunt style again when asked by Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) how he might urge Trump to check his prolific tweeting to preserve foreign relations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be telling the boss how he ought to communicate with the American people. That\u2019s going to be his choice,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that he expects to be in sync with Trump on world affairs.\n\nIf there\u2019s any disagreement, \u201cI have his cellphone number,\u201d Tillerson added. \u201cAnd he\u2019s promised me he\u2019ll answer \u2014 and he does.\u201d\n\nKaroun Demirjian, Karen DeYoung and Steven Mufson contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/05/National-Politics/Images/308515934_0-4.jpg", "title": "Tillerson calls U.S. intelligence findings on Russian interference in election \u2018troubling\u2019", "summary": "He declined to label Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin a war criminal or to condemn Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over human rights abuses the leader himself claims he committed.\nSecretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson called U.S. intelligence findings of Russian interference in the presidential election \u201ctroubling\u201d Wednesday but said he has not yet seen classified information about allegations that Russia intended to help President-elect Donald Trump.\n\u201cIn my conversations with him on the subjects we have discussed, he\u2019s been very open and inviting of my views and respectful of those views,\u201d Tillerson said of Trump.\n\u201cThat report clearly is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described were undertaken,\u201d Tillerson said.\nThat\u2019s going to be his choice,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that he expects to be in sync with Trump on world affairs.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Ed O Keefe Is A Congressional Reporter Who Has Covered Congressional Presidential Politics Since He Previously Covered Federal Agencies The Federal Workforce Spent A Brief Time Covering The War In Iraq Follow Edatpost", "Anne Gearan Is A National Politics Correspondent For The Washington Post"], "keywords": ["sen", "president", "trumps", "findings", "calls", "views", "intelligence", "sanctions", "interference", "election", "tillerson", "russian", "troubling", "russia", "exxonmobil", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2017-01-10 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/10/jeff-sessions-fight-racism-charges-senate-hearing-/", "text": "Sen.

He has pledged to uphold the law fairly and equitably.

And you know that I believe in fairness, impartiality, and equal justice under the law,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Sessions will outline goals for battling gun crimes, illegal immigration, drub-trafficking cartels and other criminal gangs. He also will pledge to protect voting rights, support local law enforcement agencies and build mutual respect between police and minority communities.\n\n\u201cIn my over 14 years in the Department of Justice, I tried cases of nearly every kind \u2014 drug trafficking, firearms, and other violent crimes, significant public corruption cases, financial wrongdoing, civil rights violations, environmental violations, and hate crimes,\u201d he says. \u201cProtecting the people of this country from crime, and especially from violent crime, is the high calling of the men and women of the Department of Justice.

And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said that, Ms. Streep and her allies aside, he was confident that celebrities and others would turn out in strong numbers for his inauguration.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll the dress shops are sold out in Washington.

Lindsey Graham implored President-elect Donald Trump Sunday to change his tune and punish Russians accused of interfering in the U.S. election, reasoning that the real estate mogul is hesitant to delve into what happened because it would undermine his legitimacy on the cusp of his inauguration.\n\nMr. Graham said there is no doubt that Russians were behind the hacks of Democratic emails revealed during the campaign, so Mr. Trump should make aggressive moves to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go on with your life as a democracy when a foreign entity is trying to compromise the election process. So Mr. President-elect, it is very important that you show leadership here,\u201d the South Carolina Republican told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to lose the election and clearly preferred Mr. Trump, according to its assessment report released Friday.\n\nRussian intelligence had access to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s network from July 2015 through at least June 2016, with its military intelligence service compromising Democratic Party officials\u2019 email accounts between March and May of 2016, the U.S. agencies said.\n\nRussian intelligence then had the information shared through WikiLeaks and other online leakers, the U.S. agencies said.\n\nMr. Trump, who has questioned the U.S.\u2019 version of events, was briefed on the report Friday and afterward released a statement that seemed to spread blame around.\n\n\u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump also said that, as president, he will form a task force to make recommendations about how to defend against cyberattacks, though he insisted the hacking did not affect the election results.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal for me,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI think he\u2019s worried that inquiring into what Russia did in the election is going to undermine his credibility and his legitimacy. Quite frankly, I haven\u2019t heard any Democrat at all of prominence say that we doubt that Donald Trump won.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s not the reason that Clinton lost and Trump won. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s saying that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Mr. President-elect, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do. What we\u2019re trying to do is find out what the Russians did in our elections and make sure that other people including the Russians won\u2019t do it next time.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham prodded the incoming president to target Mr. Putin more aggressively, saying that intelligence has revealed that Russia was behind the hacks \u2014 not some teenager or 300-pound guy at home, as Mr. Trump once suggested (though the mogul referred to a 400-pounder).\n\nThe senator and his congressional compadre \u2014 Arizona Sen. John McCain \u2014 said intelligence communities have been wrong before, namely in the run-up to the Iraq War, but that this intelligence appears to be solid.\n\nMr. McCain said the cyber threat extends beyond elections, so it is time to push back.\n\n\u201cIt is across the board, including military secrets that we have, including the ability to shut down satellites, including the ability to shut down power plants,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they can do grave danger to the United States of America. We never tried to do anything like that.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona Republican said he wishes that Mr. Trump could have visited Eastern Europe with them, to see the anxiety-filled fallout from Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThey have slaughtered Ukrainians. They have dismembered a country,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think they are through. And they\u2019ve done so in violation of all international norms of behavior. And they\u2019re putting strains on the post-World War II new world order, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

He speculated, \u201cperhaps more time needed to build a case.\u201d Intelligence officials said there had been no delay.\n\nTrump also has drawn attention to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s recent interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d in which Assange insisted the Russians were not his source for thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nSome Republicans, though, have made clear they harbor few doubts about Russia\u2019s cyber-meddling -- and do not see Assange as a reliable source.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said at Thursday\u2019s hearing that he believes Assange is responsible for publishing names of individuals who work with the U.S. government and putting them at risk.\n\nClapper said, \u201cYes, he has,\u201d adding that he does not find Assange to be credible.\n\nMcCain also said Thursday that \"every American should be alarmed\" by Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThere is \"no escaping the fact that this committee meets today for the first time in this new Congress in the aftermath of an unprecedented attack on our democracy,\" he said.\n\nIn prepared testimony Thursday, intelligence officials said Russia poses a major and growing threat to U.S. government, military, diplomatic and commercial operations -- as well as America's critical infrastructure. Russia is among at least 30 nations that are developing capabilities to launch cyberattacks, according to their statement. Clapper on Thursday stood by claims that the Russian government was involved in the 2016 hacking.\n\nIn new tweets early Thursday, Trump backed away from Assange somewhat. He blamed the \"dishonest media\" for portraying him as agreeing with Assange.\n\nAccusations Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic email accounts have roiled Washington for weeks. Obama struck back at Moscow in late December with penalties aimed at Russia's leading spy agencies, the GRU and FSB, that the U.S. said were involved. The GRU is Russia's military intelligence agency. The FSB is the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.\n\nBut Trump easily could rescind the sanctions. So far, he has publicly refused to accept the conclusion that Russia is responsible for the attacks. Trump suggested Wednesday in a tweet that one of Russia's primary targets, the Democratic National Committee, could be to blame for being \"so careless.\"\n\nCIA Director John Brennan said in a Dec. 16 message to employees that the FBI agreed with the agency's conclusion that Russia's goal was to support Trump in the election. Brennan wrote that he also had spoken with Clapper and said \"there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.\"\n\nMoscow has denied the hacking allegations and dismissed Obama's sanctions as an attempt to \"harm Russian-American ties.\" Although Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuked the Obama administration for trying to punish Russia, he said his country would not immediately retaliate and would instead wait for a new U.S. approach after Trump takes office.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/01/03/0/0/694940094001_5269507137001_New-questions-over-if-Russia-was-really-involved-in-hacking.jpg?ve=1", "title": "What's inside?

Amazingly, the author of the piece misrepresents the very data she is using to build her erroneous case against school choice.\n\n\"Free Market for Education? Economists Generally Don't Buy It,\" claims Susan Dynarski, a professor of education, public policy, and economics at the University of Michigan, in The Times. This is a betrayal of expectations, according to Dynarski, because economists generally understand that free markets produce better outcomes than central planners (much to the chagrin of education professors). Economists are usually the ones calling for less regulation and more unrestricted capitalism; if they're super conflicted about markets in education, that would be a serious indictment of the school choice approach. Dynarski writes:\n\nYou might think that most economists agree with this overall approach, because economists generally like free markets. For example, over 90 percent of the members of the University of Chicago's panel of leading economists thought that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft made consumers better off by providing competition for the highly regulated taxi industry. But economists are far less optimistic about what an unfettered market can achieve in education. Only a third of economists on the Chicago panel agreed that students would be better off if they all had access to vouchers to use at any private (or public) school of their choice.\n\nThat does sound bad for school choice\u2014it suggests that two-thirds of surveyed economists disagree that students with vouchers would be better off.\n\nBut Dynarski is applying spin. Here is the survey:\n\nA chunk of economists\u201437 percent\u2014couldn't say for sure whether vouches would improve educational outcomes. That's not so surprising: education reform is a complicated issue and economists are thorough, cautious people. Moreover, it's true that vouchers don't always make things better for every kid\u2014providing more choices is not the same thing as magically reversing decades of poverty, racial inequality, and bad incentives.\n\nBut among economists who did take a position on the issue, school vouchers were a big winner. As Slate Star Codex explains:\n\n36% of economists agree that vouchers would improve education, compared to 19% who disagree. The rest are unsure or didn't answer the question. The picture looks about the same when weighted by the economists' confidence. A more accurate way to summarize this graph is \"About twice as many economists believe a voucher system would improve education as believe that it wouldn't.\" By leaving it at \"only a third of economists support vouchers\", the article implies that there is an economic consensus against the policy. Heck, it more than implies it \u2013 its title is \"Free Market For Education: Economists Generally Don't Buy It\". But its own source suggests that, of economists who have an opinion, a large majority are pro-voucher. (note also that the options are only \"agree that vouchers will improve education\" and \"disagree that vouchers will improve education\", so that it's unclear from the data if any dissenting economists agree with the Times' position that vouchers will make things worse. They might just think that things would stay the same.) I think this is really poor journalistic practice and implies the opinion of the nation's economists to be the opposite of what it really is. I hope the Times prints a correction.\n\nI would also note that I read through most of the surveyed economists' comments, and it seems pretty clear that those who were \"uncertain\" did think school vouchers would improve outcomes for a lot of kids; they just thought it was hard to quantify the overall effect. \"I think the majority of public school students would be better off, but certainly not all,\" wrote one economist. \"The question is ambiguous about the percent.\" You can judge for yourself whether the responses should be further weighted toward the pro-voucher position.\n\nBut that's not even everything that's wrong with the article. Having smeared school choice as something the Trump administration will push despite the learned skepticism of \"economists generally,\" Dynarski then goes on to point out a number other policy issues where the consensus is against the free market:\n\nWhile economists are trained about the value of free markets, they are also trained to spot when markets can't work alone and government intervention is required. A classic example is pollution. Factories and cars that spew toxins ruin the air for everyone. Pollution is what economists call a \"negative externality\": Drivers get the benefits of the gas they burn when they drive to work, but everyone else gets the bad emissions. Economists recommend governments use taxes and regulations to minimize this negative externality. In most markets, in fact, economists advocate striking a balance between free competition and regulation. While they vary considerably in where they would strike that balance, it's unusual for an economist to claim that private markets can serve every need without any government intervention at all.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure readers should trust Dynarski's impression of what economists think\u2014and in fact, there are plenty of economists who say markets and property rights would reduce all sorts of environmental problems\u2014but let's assume she's right: Economists agree that there are some things the free market just can't handle on its own.*\n\nEarlier, Dynarski associated the free market position with school vouchers. Now she is saying that the free market position is \"private markets can serve every need without any government intervention at all.\" That's an incredible contradiction. Dynarski, I suppose, wants her readers to believe that school vouchers are an anarcho-capitalist delusion that would gut public education and leave children to become feral and illiterate. In reality, school vouchers represent exactly the sort of \"balance between free market competition and regulation\" that economists support. Under a voucher system, education is still publicly funded. Many schools are still run by the government. Those that are not explicitly run by the government are still subjected to considerable regulation.\n\nDynarski is making the case that smart, reasonable people support market competition as long as it's accompanied by significant government intervention. Dynarski is also, for some reason, making the case against school vouchers\u2014even though vouchers are the perfect example of the kind of thing she claims is smart and reasonable.\n\nSupporters of school choice are not extremists. They do not want to destroy public funding for education, or leave children to fend for themselves. They have merely observed that a specific model\u2014forcing kids to attend a specific school that comports with the zip code assigned to them at birth\u2014is inefficient, immoral, and prone to abuse. There has been too much top-down government management, and not enough competition, in the American education system. Reforms, like the voucher system, are a necessary corrective. They provide balance between government and privatization.\n\nIf you're against this kind of thing, it's your own views that are squarely at odds with most economists.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Dynarski doesn't stop there\u2014the rest of the article stakes out a ludicrous position on the college loan crisis:\n\nExcessive faith in the power of free markets can lead to infeasible policy proposals. The Republican platform recommends expanding the role of private banks in student loans, with the goal of enhancing financing choices for students. But making student loans a competitive, private-sector market is an unattainable goal. In economics textbooks, student loans are the example used to show there are some products that markets will never provide on their own. In a classic business deal, an entrepreneur puts up collateral to get a loan for a potentially profitable investment. But a teenager can't walk into a private bank and receive a loan for tens of thousands of dollars based solely on her academic promise, even though a college education is (on average) an extremely lucrative investment. This is a capital-market failure: Private lenders won't provide liquidity for profitable investments. Because of this failure of private markets, across the world it is governments that provide student loans.\n\nThat's right: The government provides student loans. How's that working out for everybody? Oh, I forgot.\n\nLest we forget, government subsidization of student loans is a direct cause of skyrocketing tuition rates, for reasons even a professor of education could understand. If the government promises to help students pay the cost on the front end\u2014no matter how extravagant it is\u2014colleges have every incentive to jack up the price: the government has already guaranteed that the money will be paid.\n\nDynarski may be correct that the private market will never supply workable college loans. If that's the case, I tend to suspect it's because college is over-valued and discerning investors don't see it as such a smart bet. Too many students would take the money, enroll in college, and then decide to become education professors\u2014misrepresenting statistics for The New York Times for a living.\n\n*Edit: Initially, this paragraph was accidentally placed in block-quotes, but it is not part of The New York Times article.\n\nUpdated at 3:00 p.m.: The Cato Institute's Jason Bedrick points out another of Dyanrski's considerable faults\u2014she actually ignored more recent survey data that further undercuts her claims:\n\nOddly, Dynarski did not include the results from the more recent 2012 IGM survey, in which the level of support for school choice was higher (44%) and opposition was lower (5%), a nearly 9:1 ratio of support to opposition. When weighted for confidence, 54% thought school choice was beneficial only 6% disagreed... We should give Professor Dynarski the benefit of the doubt and assume that she didn't know about the more recent results (though they pop right up on Google and the IGM search feature), but the NYT deserves no such benefit for its continuing pattern of misleading readers about the evidence for school choice.\n\nThis seems more and more like willful misrepresentation of inconvenient facts.", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14833359487637.jpg", "title": "The New York Times Gets Everything Wrong in This Article That Falsely Claims Economists Don\u2019t Like School Choice", "summary": "Heck, it more than implies it \u2013 its title is \"Free Market For Education: Economists Generally Don't Buy It\".\nIn reality, school vouchers represent exactly the sort of \"balance between free market competition and regulation\" that economists support.\nDynarski writes:You might think that most economists agree with this overall approach, because economists generally like free markets.\nA recent New York Times story that slams the free market approach to education policy is rife with inaccuracies.\nBut among economists who did take a position on the issue, school vouchers were a big winner.", "source": "Reason", "bias": "Bias: Lean Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["school", "dynarski", "dont", "economists", "education", "vouchers", "free", "choice", "private", "wrong", "falsely", "york", "claims", "gets", "markets", "market", "times"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2017-01-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/obama-to-huddle-with-democrats-on-protecting-his-signature-health-care-law/2017/01/04/34b655e8-d1f9-11e6-945a-76f69a399dd5_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_obamacare-725a-1%3Ahomepage/story&utm_term=.1c366c31856c", "text": "(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nCongressional Republicans on Wednesday launched their long-promised effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even as they acknowledged that they may need several months to develop a replacement along conservative lines.\n\nSignifying how enormous a priority the issue is for the incoming administration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence met privately to discuss it with House and Senate Republicans. He offered no details afterward about what a new health-care law might look like but vowed to unwind the existing one through a mixture of executive actions and legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama made a rare Capitol Hill appearance, meeting behind closed doors with Democrats from both chambers. He urged members of his party not to help the GOP devise a new health-care law.\n\nThe dueling high-level visits, on the same day that the Senate opened debate on a budget resolution that would begin rolling back the law, highlighted the sharp political fault lines that surround the future of the government\u2019s health policies.\n\nThe president, who was accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) as he entered the Capitol, took no questions from reporters before or after the nearly two-hour meeting. But participants said he told members of his party that they did not have to \u201crescue\u201d Republicans and that they should \u201cstay strong\u201d as the GOP strives to replace the law.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nPence told reporters that he and Trump would pursue a \u201ctwo-track approach\u201d to chip away at the ACA through executive powers and legislation. Trump is \u201cworking on a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place,\u201d Pence said, and is eyeing other policies that can be reversed.\n\n[With Obamacare, GOP faces the \u2018Pottery Barn rule\u2019: You break it, you own it ]\n\nWhile Pence did not identify other policy targets, Republicans from Western states urged him Wednesday to undo some of the public land protections Obama has created through the 1906 Antiquities Act. Other executive actions, including those providing new safeguards for LGBT Americans and curbing greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change, also could come under fire.\n\nAccording to a lobbyist in touch with congressional aides on the ACA issue, the Trump transition team has been considering ways to strip down the health benefits that insurers must provide in plans that they sell to individuals and small businesses.\n\nThis list of \u201cessential health benefits\u201d was envisioned by the law but was defined in a regulation written by the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, the incoming administration could alter it without help from Congress.\n\n[Why Obamacare is unlikely to die a swift death]\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to urge Republicans to \u201cbe careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster.\u201d In a dig at Schumer and his allies, Trump added: \u201cDon\u2019t let the Schumer clowns out of this web.\u201d\n\nLess than half an hour after Trump\u2019s social media messages, Schumer tweeted: \u201cRepublicans should stop clowning around with America\u2019s health care. Don\u2019t #MakeAmericaSickAgain.\u201d\n\nSchumer and other Democrats echoed Obama, saying they did not feel any responsibility to craft a substitute health-care bill.\n\n\u201cIf you are repealing, show us what you\u2019ll replace it with. Then we\u2019ll look at what you have and see what you can do,\u201d said Schumer, who met briefly with Pence on Wednesday.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Obama told Democrats that they are well positioned to defend the law, which has extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.\n\nHowever, Obama also told lawmakers that he recognized that he had not succeeded in selling the law to the public. \u201cThere was an acknowledgment that so many features were so popular, but there was a failure to communicate that,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said.\n\n[Donald Trump, meet your toughest hurdle: The U.S. Senate]\n\nPence, who was greeted by applause as he entered the House GOP meeting with Reince Priebus, Kelly Anne Conway and several other future White House aides, made it clear that Trump, starting on the first day of his presidency, intended to embark on an aggressive campaign to reverse executive actions made by Obama.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t enumerate a list, just that which came by the pen can die by the pen,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.).\n\nThe first bill Republicans introduced in the new Senate that convened Tuesday was budget legislation with instructions for House and Senate committees to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. The bare-bones spending outline requires members of four committees \u2014 Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce in the House; and Finance, as well as Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in the Senate \u2014 to produce bills just seven days after Trump\u2019s inauguration that each would save $1 billion over a decade by slashing elements of the heath-care law.\n\n[Democrats: Trump will make America sick again]\n\nHouse Republicans tasked with writing the repeal legislation said that no final decisions have been made on what it will include. Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio) who chairs a House subcommittee that oversees health care, called the incoming administration\u2019s Jan. 27 deadline \u201ca challenging goal.\u201d\n\nAmong the unanswered questions is whether Republicans will immediately end health-care taxes, such as an additional 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax and a 3.8 percent investment income tax, that were created to help pay for the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans have insisted that the taxes should be eliminated immediately, even if lawmakers decide to delay the repeal of other parts of the law. Others worry that repealing the taxes will make it impossible to pay to keep Obamacare afloat while a replacement is finished.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet,\u201d Tiberi said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not consensus on this.\u201d\n\nRep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a member the Trump transition team, said in an interview that \u201cwe have six months to work out the replacement plan\u201d for the sweeping health-care law.\n\nSenate rules allow budget resolutions to pass by a simple majority \u2014 a maneuver that guarantees that the chamber\u2019s Democratic minority will not have enough votes for a filibuster to block repeal.\n\nOnly changes related to taxes, spending or the long-term federal budget are eligible for the simple-majority treatment, however. Other parts of the law, such as the structure of the insurance marketplaces, probably would require a filibuster-proof margin of 60 votes in the Senate, a trickier task since the new Senate has 52 Republicans.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nSince its passage by Congress in the spring of 2010 \u2014 entirely with Democratic votes \u2014 the ACA has spurred the most significant changes to U.S. health policy since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid during the Great Society legislation of the 1960s. It also has faced sustained opposition from Republicans, leading to two Supreme Court cases and a lawsuit over cost-sharing subsidies that is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nThe ACA is best known for having expanded insurance coverage, starting in 2014, in two ways: new marketplaces selling private health plans to Americans who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job, and an expansion of Medicaid in about three-fifths of the states. The marketplaces got off to a shaky start because of computer dysfunction with HealthCare.gov, the federal enrollment website.\n\n[Trump just met with super-influential health-care executives you\u2019ve probably never heard of]\n\nThree years later, the U.S. Census reported that the nation\u2019s uninsured rate had declined to 9.1 percent, with most of a recent decrease coming from people who bought insurance on their own and more who had joined Medicaid.\n\nThe president\u2019s visit to the Hill was part of a broader, last-ditch effort by his administration to preserve a central element of his domestic legacy.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) drew attention to the stakes for his state by issuing a county-by-county breakdown of the estimated 2.7 million New Yorkers who would lose coverage if the law were repealed. He pointed out that New York would lose $595 million this year in federal money that has helped the state expand its Medicaid program.\n\nHHS officials have been trying to use to their advantage the fact that the change in administrations will take place while the fourth year\u2019s enrollment period for ACA health plans is underway. On Wednesday, HHS released HealthCare.gov enrollment figures showing that 8.8 million Americans chose or were automatically re-enrolled in ACA health plans between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 in the 39 states that rely on the federal exchange website. That is about 200,000 more than at the same time a year ago, although the proportion of new customers was lower.\n\nThe new drive to unwind the health-care law will take time. Senate leaders must allow Democrats to offer a nearly unlimited number of amendments before a final budget vote. Democrats plan to use the process, known as a \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d to offer a long string of potentially toxic amendments that could make it difficult for Republicans to vote for the final legislation, Democratic leadership aides said.\n\nMike DeBonis, Ed O\u2019Keefe, Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/01/04/Others/Images/2017-01-04/ObamaCapitol004.JPG", "title": "GOP launches long-promised repeal of Obamacare with no full plan to replace it", "summary": "He urged members of his party not to help the GOP devise a new health-care law.\nThe new drive to unwind the health-care law will take time.\nHe offered no details afterward about what a new health-care law might look like but vowed to unwind the existing one through a mixture of executive actions and legislation.\nSignifying how enormous a priority the issue is for the incoming administration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence met privately to discuss it with House and Senate Republicans.\nHHS officials have been trying to use to their advantage the fact that the change in administrations will take place while the fourth year\u2019s enrollment period for ACA health plans is underway.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post's Senior National Affairs Correspondent Covering How The New Administration Is Transforming A Range Of U S Policies The Federal Government Itself She Is The Author Of Two Books One On Sharks Another On Congress Not To Be Confused With Each Other Has Worked For The Post Since", "Kelsey Snell Covers Congress With A Focus On Budget Fiscal Issues For The Washington Post She Previously Covered Tax Trade Budget Policy", "Amy Goldstein Is A National Reporter For The Washington Post Focusing On Health-care Policy"], "keywords": ["aca", "law", "trump", "healthcare", "senate", "launches", "republicans", "obamacare", "house", "replace", "schumer", "health", "plan", "longpromised", "repeal", "gop", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2017-01-04 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/us/politics/transition-briefing-trump-us-intelligence.html?hp=&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news", "text": "But now, Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America\u2019s intelligence services.\n\nMr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\nMr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday.\n\nThere were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence \u2014 with \u201c100 percent\u201d certainty.\n\nAs he has previously, Mr. Assange said: \u201cOur source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties.\u201d But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks.com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2.0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents.\n\nIn addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D.N.C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange\u2019s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion.\n\nIntelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well.\n\nAs for that \u201cterrible\u201d information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city\u2019s lead-contaminated water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here, among other places.\n\nAnd that was hardly an unexpected query \u2014 for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post.\n\nThe president-elect appears to be getting a jump on the news.\n\nPence backs up Trump \u2014 and Republicans squirm\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump\u2019s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administration\u2019s icy blasts toward United States intelligence.\n\nMr. Trump \u201cexpressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,\u201d Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position.

Ryan steered clear of criticizing the president-elect, saying he would not be commenting on \u201cevery little tweet or Facebook post.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he called Mr. Assange \u201ca sycophant for Russia,\u201d who \u201cleaks, steals data and compromises national security.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll get up to speed on what\u2019s been happening and what Russia has or has not done,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 to the White House\n\nMs. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. Trump\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists.\n\nThe appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations.\n\nJohn DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel.\n\nAnd George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president.\n\nBut for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault.\n\nTop White House jobs are going to political veterans\n\nMs. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House.\n\nMr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, as his deputy chief of staff for operations, a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security, among other things.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe named Rick Dearborn, who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill, as his chief liaison to Congress, heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs.\n\nKatie Walsh, who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, will become his deputy at the White House, overseeing senior staff, scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Priebus called the three a \u201cteam of doers\u201d who would fill critical roles.\n\nKellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to Mr. Trump, said she was thrilled to have \u201canother strong female leader\u201d on the team in Ms. Walsh.\n\nTrump finds timing of intelligence briefing \u2018very strange\u2019\n\nFirst, Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election, but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then, on New Year\u2019s Eve, the president-elect promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday, he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know.\n\nAnd now, he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight.\n\nThe Obama administration quickly let it be known that, in fact, intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused.\n\nNor were some Republican political consultants.\n\nBut this is not the first time the president-elect has taken a swipe at the intelligence community, which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president.\n\nAs debate begins on repealing health act, Trump steels G.O.P. spines\n\nPresident Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Vice President-elect Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIt needs to be done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter, trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with pre-existing health problems.\n\n\u201cSchumer clowns\u201d may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new minority leader, but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care.\n\n\u201cRepublicans should stop clowning around with Americans\u2019 Medicare, Medicaid and health care,\u201d Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would \u201cthrow the entire health care system into chaos.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, tried to coin a phrase: \u201cMake America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?\u201d\n\nTrump picks an S.E.C. chairman\n\nThe Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe president-elect is expected to speak to the news media on Jan. 11\n\nThe last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27, when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that \u201cmany people\u201d saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers\u2019 home and failed to report it.\n\nThat long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm.

Ryan, who also opposed making the change now, said in a statement that he has instructed the Ethics Committee not to interfere with the independent office, and said the new oversight is designed to make sure the independent office is following its own rules.\n\n\u201cThe office is not controlled by the committee, and I expect that oversight authority to be exercised solely to ensure the office is properly following its rules and laws, just as any government entity should,\u201d he said.\n\nBut both conservative and liberal watchdog groups blasted the move, and Democrats said it was a poor start for the new Congress.\n\n\u201cRepublicans claim they want to \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cEvidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.\u201d\n\nThe ethics office could be the first of a number of areas where Mr. Trump finds more common cause with Democrats than with his own party in Congress, raising the possibility of strange new coalitions emerging from Capitol Hill.\n\nMr. McCarthy said the GOP conference\u2019s ability to ignore leadership\u2019s concerns didn\u2019t faze him, since Mr. Ryan promised an open process in which members propose changes, debate them and vote.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s rather healthy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also insisted there wasn\u2019t much daylight between himself and the president-elect, arguing both men focused on the timing, rather than the substance, of the reforms.\n\n\u201cWell, I read the tweet. Those are the same arguments I made last night in conference,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McCarthy said he didn\u2019t get a heads up from Mr. Trump before the mogul spoke out, but he isn\u2019t worried that Mr. Trump will mainly speak to leadership through social media.\n\nHe said he communicates with the president-elect \u201cquite often.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Over the past few decades, we here at the Year in Review have reviewed some pretty disturbing years. For example, there was 2000, when the outcome of a presidential election was decided by a tiny group of deeply confused Florida residents who had apparently attempted to vote by chewing on their ballots.\n\nThen there was 2003, when a person named \u201cParis Hilton\u201d suddenly became a major international superstar, despite possessing a level of discernible talent so low as to make the Kardashians look like the Jackson 5.\n\nThere was 2006, when the vice president of the United States \u2014 who claimed he was attempting to bring down a suspected quail \u2014 shot a 78-year-old man in the face, only to be exonerated after an investigation revealed that the victim was an attorney.\n\nAnd \u2014 perhaps most inexplicable of all \u2014 there was 2007, when millions of people voluntarily installed Windows Vista.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve seen some weird years. But we\u2019ve never seen one as weird as 2016. This was the Al Yankovic of years. If years were movies, 2016 would be \u201cPlan 9 From Outer Space.\u201d If years were relatives, 2016 would be the uncle who shows up at your Thanksgiving dinner wearing his underpants on the outside.\n\n(Claritza Jimenez,Elahe Izadi/The Washington Post)\n\nWhy do we say this? Let\u2019s begin with the gruesome train wreck that was the presidential election. The campaign began with roughly 14,000 candidates running. Obviously not all of them were qualified to be president; some of them \u2014 here we are thinking of \u201cLincoln Chafee\u201d \u2014 were probably imaginary. But a reasonable number of the candidates seemed to meet at least the minimum standard that Americans have come to expect of their president in recent decades, namely: Not Completely Horrible.\n\nSo this mass of candidates began the grim death march that is the modern American presidential campaign \u2014 trudging around Iowa pretending to care about agriculture, performing in an endless series of televised debates like suit-wearing seals trained to bark out talking points, going to barbecue after barbecue and smiling relentlessly through mouthfuls of dripping meat, giving the same speech over and over and over, shaking millions of hands, posing for billions of selfies and just generally humiliating themselves in the marathon group grovel that America insists on putting its presidential candidates through.\n\nAnd we voters did our part, passing judgment on the candidates, thinning the herd, rejecting them one by one. Sometimes we had to reject them more than once; John Kasich didn\u2019t get the message until his own staff felled him with tranquilizer darts.\n\nBut eventually we eliminated the contenders whom we considered to be unqualified or disagreeable, whittling our choices down until only two major candidates were left. And out of all the possibilities, the two that We, the People, in our collective wisdom, deemed worthy of competing for the most important job on Earth, turned out to be ...\n\n... drum roll ...\n\n... the most flawed, sketchy and generally disliked duo of presidential candidates ever!\n\nYes. After all that, the American people, looking for a leader, ended up with a choice between ointment and suppository. The fall campaign was an unending national nightmare, broadcast relentlessly on cable TV. CNN told us over and over that Donald Trump was a colossally ignorant, narcissistic, out-of-control sex-predator buffoon; Fox News countered that Hillary Clinton was a greedy, corrupt, coldly calculating liar of massive ambition and minimal accomplishment. In our hearts we knew the awful truth: They were both right.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just bad. It was the Worst. Election. Ever.\n\nAnd that was only one of the reasons 2016 should never have happened. Here are some others:\n\n\u25cf American race relations reached their lowest point since ... okay, since 2015.\n\n\u25cf We learned that the Russians are more involved in our election process than the League of Women Voters.\n\n\u25cfMuch of the year the economy continued to struggle, with the only growth sector being people paying insane prices for tickets to \u201cHamilton.\u201d\n\n\u25cf In a fad even stupider than \u201cplanking,\u201d millions of people wasted millions of hours, and sometimes risked their lives, trying to capture imaginary Pok\u00e9mon Go things on their phones, hoping to obtain the ultimate prize: a whole bunch of imaginary Pok\u00e9mon Go things on their phones.\n\n\u25cf A major new threat to American communities \u2014 receiving at least as much coverage as global climate change \u2014 emerged in the form of: clowns.\n\n\u25cf In a shocking development that caused us to question our most fundamental values, Angelina and Brad broke up even though they are both physically attractive.\n\n\u25cf We continued to prove, as a nation, that no matter how many times we are reminded, we are too stupid to remember to hold our phones horizontally when we make videos.\n\n\u25cf Musically, we lost Prince, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen; we gained the suicide-inducing TV commercial in which Jon Bon Jovi screeches about turning back time.\n\nDid anything good happen in 2016? Let us think. ...\n\nOkay, the \u201cman bun\u201d appeared to be going away.\n\nThat was pretty much it for the good things.\n\nAnd now, finally, it is time for 2016 to go away. But before it does, let\u2019s narrow our eyes down to slits and take one last squinting look back at this hideous monstrosity of a year, starting with ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nJanuary\n\n... which actually begins on a positive note with the capture of elusive Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who in 2015 escaped (for the second time) from a Mexican prison when authorities failed to notice the signs reading (in Spanish) \u201cWARNING: ESCAPE TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.\u201d Since then Guzm\u00e1n had been in hiding except for an interview with Sean Penn, a guest spot with Jimmy Kimmel and a series of commercials for Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nMexican police finally are able to track him down during his four-week stint as a guest judge on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d He is taken to Tijuana and incarcerated in what authorities describe as \u201ca very secure Motel 6.\u201d\n\nIn health news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responding to the spread of the little-understood Zika virus, cautions Americans not to have unprotected sex with foreign mosquitoes. Meanwhile the Flint, Mich., water crisis worsens when samples taken from the city\u2019s main water supply are found to contain traces of a Chipotle burrito.\n\nNorth Korea successfully tests a hydrogen bomb, although this achievement is tarnished somewhat by the fact that the explosion causes the death, by startling, of the isolated nation\u2019s lone remaining chicken.\n\nIn what critics cite as yet another example of declining U.S. prestige, Iran seizes two U.S. naval vessels and captures 10 crew members; what makes the incident particularly embarrassing is that these vessels were docked in Cleveland. The captured sailors are released, but only after Secretary of State John Kerry assures the Iranian government that he will not deploy James Taylor.\n\nThe Powerball jackpot reaches a record $1.6 billion, with an estimated 45 percent of the tickets being purchased by the city of Detroit using money budgeted for \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of huge amounts of money being wasted, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nFebruary\n\n... the presidential primary season takes center stage. On the Republican side, the big issue \u2014 as you would expect, given the stakes in this election \u2014 is Donald Trump\u2019s hand size and whether it does or does not correlate with the size of his portfolio, which he claims is huge, although he is reluctant to show it to the non-supermodel public.\n\nThe hand-size issue is raised by Marco Rubio, who scores in the early polls, then fades as voters realize that he is still in the early stages of puberty. Trump\u2019s strongest rival is Ted Cruz, a veteran debater so knowledgeable and confident that Mahatma Gandhi would want to punch him in the face.\n\nMeanwhile Jeb Bush, who was considered the early favorite, fails to gain traction with the voters despite having by far the most comprehensive set of policy initiativezzz\n\nSorry! We nodded off thinking about Jeb, as did the voters.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is widely presumed to be the front-runner based on being a historic woman with a lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of service to the nation who, with her husband, Bill, has serviced the nation for decades to the tune of several hundred million dollars. She is declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses via a controversial and confusing process that, in some precincts, involves dodgeball. But Clinton faces an unexpectedly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders, a feisty 217-year-old senator from Vermont with a message of socialism, but the good kind of socialism where everybody gets a lot of free stuff, not the kind where starving people fight over who gets the lone remaining beet at the co-op. Sanders wins the New Hampshire Democratic primary, followed \u2014 in what some observers see as a troubling sign \u2014 by Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn other February news:\n\n\u25cf A lengthy standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon finally comes to an end when anti-government militants, after protracted negotiations, are eaten by the federal wildlife.\n\n\u25cf Following the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the nation\u2019s political leaders observe a period of mourning and reflection lasting 3 billionths of a second, then commence the important bipartisan work of not making any progress whatsoever on a replacement.\n\n\u25cf The troubled Chipotle chain temporarily closes all of its restaurants after several customers are attacked by what health authorities describe as \u201cE. coli bacteria the size of adult pythons.\u201d\n\n\u25cf The Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl, thanks in part to a costly unsportsmanlike conduct penalty called on the Carolina Panthers defense for stealing Peyton Manning\u2019s walker.\n\nSpeaking of unsportsmanlike, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nMarch\n\n... the Republican presidential race grows increasingly nasty, spiraling downward in tone to the point where Ted Cruz makes the following statement, which we swear we are not making up: \u201cDonald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him.\u201d This sounds as though Cruz is saying that he would copulate with a rat, as long as the rat was not Donald Trump.\n\nPresumably that is not what Cruz meant, but nobody really wants to know what he did mean. Meanwhile Ben Carson announces, in his extremely low-key and soft-spoken manner, that he is going to suspend his campaign. Or visit Spain. Or possibly rob a train. There is no way to be certain.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders are also in a tight and testy battle, although Clinton slowly gains the upper hand thanks to the Democratic Party\u2019s controversial formula for allocating \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d which is as follows:\n\n\u25cf 57 percent go to Clinton.\n\n\u25cf The remaining 43 percent also go to Clinton.\n\nResponding to charges from the Sanders camp that the Democratic National Committee is tipping the scales in Clinton\u2019s favor, chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz states that \u201cthe DNC is scrupulously neutral in the contest between Secretary Clinton and the senile Commie fart.\u201d\n\nIn other political news, President Obama nominates Merrick Garland to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Republican leaders are quick to note that, while Garland appears to be qualified, his name is an anagram for \u201cRancid Lark Germ.\u201d\n\nBut by far the most controversial political issue of the month \u2014 which nobody thought about before, yet which all of a sudden is the defining civil rights struggle of the 21st century \u2014 is the question of who can pee where in North Carolina.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Obama pays a historic visit to Cuba but is forced to leave after three days when he discovers that there is only one golf course.\n\nA historic baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team has to be called off in the fourth inning because all but four of the Cuban players have switched sides.\n\nSpeaking of historic, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward/For The Washington Post)\n\nApril\n\n... England observes the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates the occasion by wearing a large hat and smiling grimly at horses.\n\nMeanwhile world tension mounts when satellite imagery reveals that North Korea has positioned an 18-story-tall plastic bottle containing an estimated 40 million liters of Diet Coke on the border with South Korea, and has somehow obtained what one military analyst describes as \u201cMentos mints the size of barns.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea insists that the project is \u201cstrictly defensive,\u201d but the United Nations Security Council, responding with its toughest sanctions yet against the rogue nation, votes to unfriend Kim Jong Un on Facebook.\n\nIn another alarming international development, Russian fighter jets, continuing a pattern of increasingly provocative behavior toward the United States, attack the control tower at LaGuardia Airport. After assessing the damage, airport authorities announce that departing flights will be delayed an average of four months, nearly twice as long as usual. Secretary of State Kerry calls the act \u201ca deliberate provocation\u201d and, in his strongest response to date, warns that the United States is considering \u201ca harshly worded memorandum.\u201d\n\nIn U.S. presidential politics, Ted Cruz, making a last-ditch effort to stop the Trump juggernaut, announces that his choice for running mate is \u2014 prepare for a game-changing jolt of high-voltage excitement \u2014 Carly Fiorina. This would be the same Carly Fiorina who dropped out after the New Hampshire primary because she got approximately six votes. On the plus side, Cruz manages to make this announcement without mentioning rats.\n\nIn other political news, Hillary Clinton is troubled by a persistent cough that leaves her unable to speak at some campaign stops, forcing her to express her commitment to working families by shattering a porcelain figurine of a Wall Street banker with a hammer.\n\nA Trump spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the Trump campaign \u201cwill not speculate on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health,\u201d adding that \u201cshe obviously has some terrible disease.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of bad news, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nMay\n\n... tragedy strikes the Cincinnati Zoo when zoo authorities, fearing for the life of a 3-year-old who climbed into the gorilla enclosure, are forced to shoot and kill a gorilla named Harambe, who instantly becomes way more revered on the Internet than Mother Teresa.\n\nIn other domestic news, passengers at major U.S. airports complain that they are missing flights because security lines are so long.\n\nQ. How long are they?\n\nA. One of them contains a Wright brother.\n\nAsked for an explanation, a spokesperson for the federal Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for screening passengers, blames the airline industry, pointing out that \u201cIf the airlines didn\u2019t keep selling tickets, we wouldn\u2019t have all these people showing up at airports trying to catch flights.\u201d The spokesperson suggests that people planning to travel by air during busy times should consider other options, such as suicide.\n\nIn a medical breakthrough, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital announce that they have performed the first successful penis transplant in the United States. The patient\u2019s name \u2014 we are not making this item up \u2014 is Manning.\n\nAbroad, satellite surveillance reveals that North Korea has constructed what military analysts describe as \u201can extremely large slingshot\u201d as well as a latex balloon believed large enough to hold a quantity of water equivalent to Lake Tahoe. The North Korean government insists that these items are intended for \u201cmedical research.\u201d\n\nIn sports, suspicions of doping by Russian Olympic athletes resurface after little-known sprinter Vladimir Raspatovsky, who has never previously posted a world\u00ad\n\n\n\nrecord time, wins the Kentucky Derby.\n\nSpeaking of winners, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nJune\n\n... it becomes evident that, barring some highly unlikely political development, the next president of the United States will be either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the nation is in the grip of a worsening heroin epidemic. Coincidence? You be the judge.\n\nSpeaking of coincidences: Bill Clinton happens to find himself in the same airport as U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and \u2014 as any two people would do if one of them was the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and the other was married to the subject of a federal investigation \u2014 they meet privately aboard Lynch\u2019s Justice Department jet. When word of the meeting leaks out, Lynch assures the press that she and Bill did not discuss the FBI investigation into Hillary\u2019s email, adding, \u201cnor did we inhale.\u201d For her part, Hillary continues to insist that she never emailed anything classified, and even if she did she actually didn\u2019t, besides which so did a lot of other people such as Colin Powell and Harry Truman, and this so-called scandal is ancient history from literally years ago that just makes a person sigh and roll her eyes because it is preventing her from fighting for working families while at the same time being a historic woman.\n\nAlso for the sake of balance we should note that throughout June Donald Trump continues to emit a steady stream of truly idiotic statements.\n\nIn sports, Cleveland \u2014 in a historic upset \u2014 actually wins something.\n\nBut the big sports story for June, and the year, is the death of Muhammad Ali, a person so remarkable that even the tidal wave of phony, saccharine media-manufactured grief-hype that engulfs modern celebrity deaths cannot detract from the simple truth that he really was as great as he said he was.\n\nInternationally, the top story is \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2014 the decision by voters in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. This comes as a big surprise to professional pollsters, who had confidently predicted the opposite result; they enjoy a hearty laugh, then head across the Atlantic to apply their talents to the forthcoming American presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile British politics is plunged into chaos, the result being that in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward/For The Washington Post)\n\nJuly\n\n... Prime Minister David Cameron and other top officials resign, new people take office, and the United Kingdom essentially has a new government, ready to move on. This entire process takes about two weeks, or less time than it takes the major American political parties to agree on the seating arrangements for a \u201ctown hall debate.\u201d\n\nIn U.S. politics, the Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Trump, although many top party officials are unable to attend because of an urgent, compelling need to not be there. Nevertheless Trump receives enthusiastic prime-time endorsements from former celebrity Scott Baio, several dozen Trump children and current Trump wife Melania, who enthralls delegates with a well-received speech in which she tells her heartwarming story of growing up as an African American woman in Chicago. The dramatic highlight comes on the final night, when Trump, in his acceptance speech, brings the delegates cheering to their feet with his emotional challenge to \u201cgrab the future by the p---y.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, the month gets off to a rocky start when FBI Director James Comey, announcing the results of the bureau\u2019s investigation, reveals that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her official emails, some including classified material, were basically as secure from prying eyes as a neon beer sign. Nevertheless Comey says he is recommending that no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, because, quote, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nWith that legal hurdle cleared, relieved Democrats gather in Philadelphia for their convention, which opens \u2014 in a bid to placate Sanders delegates \u2014 with the ceremonial caning of Debbie Wasserman Schultz. This is followed by several hundred speeches praising Hillary Clinton for the many accomplishments she has achieved, as well as the achievements she has accomplished, while at the same time being, historically, a woman. In her acceptance speech, Clinton calls on Americans \u201cto join with me in building a better world for us and for our children,\u201d adding, \u201cor I will crush you like an insect.\u201d\n\nIn a media shake-up, Roger Ailes resigns as chairman of Fox News following allegations that his name can be re\u00adarranged to spell \u201cI ogle rears.\u201d\n\nAs the month ends, skydiver Luke Aikins sets a world record by jumping out of a plane 25,000 feet over California without a parachute or wingsuit. He manages to land safely in a net despite the fact that on the way down \u2014 in what John Kerry calls \u201ca deliberate provocation\u201d \u2014 he is strafed by Russian fighter jets.\n\nSpeaking of provocations, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nAugust\n\n... Donald Trump goes to Mexico, having been informed by his team of foreign-policy advisers that this is where Mexicans come from. He meets with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and although he does not try to convince Pe\u00f1a Nieto that Mexico should pay for the huge imaginary wall that he has promised to build, Trump does demonstrate his legendary prowess as a hard-nosed businessman by negotiating what he describes as \u201ca fantastic price\u201d on a souvenir sombrero that he claims is \u201ceasily four feet in diameter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile newly released State Department emails cause some people to suggest that the reason a variety of dodgy foreign businesspeople and nations gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state was that they expected \u2014 Get a load of THIS wacky right-wing conspiracy theory! \u2014 to receive special access to or favors from the U.S. government. Hillary has no choice but to roll her eyes and laugh in a violently unnatural manner at this latest attempt to use these discredited smear tactics to prevent her, a historic and lifelong woman, from fighting for working families as well as working for fighting families.\n\nAbroad, the Summer Olympics open in Brazil amid dire warnings about Zika, riots, muggers, muggers with Zika, and windsurfers being attacked by predatory oceangoing feces. But the games for the most part go smoothly, the biggest glitch being when one of the diving pools mysteriously turns a dark, murky green. The mystery is finally solved when the pool is drained, revealing a Russian nuclear submarine, which Russia insists is in international waters.\n\nIn the athletic competition, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt becomes the first athlete ever to win the men\u2019s 100-meter final wearing flip-flops. But the U.S. team dominates the Games, with the most memorable performance coming from a team of athletes led by swimmer and rocket scientist Ryan Lochte competing in the Four-Man Gas Station Wall Pee.\n\nElsewhere in sports, the opening of the National Football League season provides a much-needed diversion to Americans who are sick of being bitterly divided over politics and welcome the opportunity to be bitterly divided over how players respond to the national anthem.\n\nSpeaking of bitter, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nSeptember\n\n... Clinton and Trump square off in the first presidential debate, which leads to a national conversation about an issue of vital concern to all Americans, namely the alleged weight gain of Alicia Machado, Miss Universe of 1996. This topic is raised by Clinton in an obvious attempt to bait Trump into wasting valuable campaign time talking about something that cannot possibly benefit him, so naturally Trump, who by his own admission has an extremely high IQ, latches on to it like a barnacle on the Titanic. He focuses on the former Miss Venezuela with laserlike intensity for the better part of a week before getting back to his previous campaign strategy of engaging in bitterly personal Twitter feuds, often with other Republicans.\n\nBut it is also not a totally great month for Clinton, who appears to collapse while being helped into a van after hastily leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony. Her campaign, responding with the transparency, openness and candor for which it is famous, initially downplays the incident, saying that Clinton felt \u201coverheated.\u201d Ninety minutes later she appears outside her daughter\u2019s apartment building and tells reporters, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d But later that afternoon her physician releases a statement saying that two days earlier, Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia. This leads to renewed speculation about Clinton\u2019s health, which is quickly quelled by a vast army of Clinton campaign officials, surrogates, allies, lackeys, henchpersons and media flunkies, all heavily armed with talking points and declaring, in unison, that she has no undeclared health problems and is going to power through this minor, pesky so-called pneumonia, which is old news and will not distract her from being a historic person of gender with a lifelong commitment to fighting for working etc.\n\nSpeaking of overheating, Samsung announces a recall of all Galaxy Note 7 phones after an attempt to rebrand them as \u201csmart charcoal lighters\u201d meets with consumer resistance. Adding to Samsung\u2019s woes are reports that some of its top-loading washers have exploded, although the company insists that the machines are \u201cperfectly safe when operated using the delicate cycle,\u201d provided that \u201cthere are no humans nearby.\u201d\n\nIn other technology news, Apple announces the release of the iPhone 7, which is basically the iPhone 6 with the added convenience of not having a headphone jack. The marketing slogan is \u201cAt Least It Doesn\u2019t Burst Into Flames.\u201d\n\nIn entertainment news, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d once again wins the coveted Emmy Award for Drama Series With the Most Naked People.\n\nBut for sheer drama, no TV show can compare with what happens to the American political system in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward/For The Washington Post)\n\nOctober\n\n... when the U.S. presidential election, until now a cross between farce and soap opera, mutates into a full-on horror show.\n\nThe early part of the month goes badly for Trump with the release of a 2005 video in which he talks about kissing and groping women, which according to him he can get away with because he\u2019s a star who uses Tic Tacs.\n\nTrump quickly apologizes for the video, noting that (a) it was recorded long ago when he was just 59 years old; (b) his remarks were \u201clocker-room banter\u201d such as you would hear in any locker room in America occupied by morally deficient billionaire pigs; (c) Bill Clinton did way worse things; and (d) WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI?\n\nBut the story does not go away. Over the next week Trump is accused of improper groping by enough women to form a professional softball league. Trump responds to these allegations with a five-pronged defense:\n\nProng One: These women are lying.\n\nProng Two: ALL of them. They are LIARS.\n\nProng Three: They are frankly not attractive enough to be groped by a star of his magnitude.\n\nProng Four: The election is rigged!\n\nProng Five: WHAT ABOUT BILL CLINTON AND BENGHAZI?\n\nMeanwhile the Clinton campaign is dealing with a steady stream of WikiLeaks emails suggesting that the Clinton Foundation is dedicated to humanitarian relief in the same sense that the Soprano family was dedicated to waste management. But this kind of scandal is ho-hum stuff for the Clinton campaign, whose slogan has slowly morphed from \u201cStronger Together\u201d into \u201cAt Least She\u2019s Predictably Corrupt.\u201d As the month wears on and Trump continues to flail away unconvincingly at his alleged groping victims, it appears more and more likely that Clinton has established herself, with just enough voters, as the least loathsome choice in this hideous, issues-free nightmare of an election.\n\nAnd then, just when we thought it could not get any weirder or any worse, we are hit with the mother of all October surprises in the form of the incurable genital wart on the body politic known as Anthony Weiner. While probing Weiner\u2019s laptop (Har!) for evidence of alleged sexting with an underaged girl, the FBI reportedly discovers thousands of emails that were sent from or to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, which apparently had a higher Internet profile than Taylor Swift.\n\nFBI Director James Comey sends a letter informing Congress that the FBI is taking another look at the email issue.\n\nIn a display of the intellectual integrity that has made our political class so respected by ordinary citizens, all the Democrats and allied pundits who praised Comey in July as a courageous public servant instantly swap positions with all the Republicans and allied pundits who said he was a cowardly hack.\n\nThis new development sends the political world into Full Freakout Mode, with cable-TV political analysts forced to change their underwear on an hourly basis. Meanwhile millions of critical swing voters switch from \u201cundecided\u201d to \u201csuicidal.\u201d\n\nIn non-campaign-related October news:\n\n\u25cf A government report concludes that the Affordable Care Act (Motto: \u201cIf You Like Your Doctor, Maybe You\u2019ll Like Your New Doctor\u201d) is going to cost many people a lot more, while continuing to provide the same range of customizable consumer options as a parking meter.\n\n\u25cf In a chilling reminder of the nation\u2019s technological vulnerability, a series of cyberattacks disrupts popular Internet sites such as Twitter and Netflix, forcing millions of Americans to make eye contact with one another.\n\n\u25cf In yet another blow to Samsung, the Federal Aviation Administration announces that it will not permit commercial aircraft to fly over states known to contain Galaxy Note 7s.\n\n\u25cf In the arts, Bob Dylan refuses to answer his doorbell, forcing members of the Swedish Academy to leave the Nobel Prize for literature in his mailbox.\n\nThe month ends on an upbeat note as Americans celebrate Halloween, a welcome escape from the relentless drumbeat of bad news, as evidenced by this FoxNews.com headline, which we swear we are not making up: \u201cSome Florida parents plan to arm themselves while going trick-or-treating over clown concerns.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of treats, in ...\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nNovember\n\n... the Chicago Cubs win the World Series. Finally! Yay! What a fun month! Okay, that\u2019s our summary of November. Now it\u2019s time to move along to the events of ...\n\nDe-\n\nNo, that would be wrong. This is supposed to be a review of the whole year, warts and all, and we have to face reality. So let\u2019s all take a deep breath, compose ourselves and go back to ...\n\nNovember\n\n... which begins with yet another letter to congressional leaders from FBI Director Comey, who lately has generated more correspondence than Publishers Clearing House. This time, he says, concerning the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop: never mind. This forces Republicans and Democrats to again swap positions on whether Comey is a courageous patriot or total scum. For a brief period members of Congress are so confused about who stands where that they are in real danger of accidentally working together and accomplishing something. Fortunately before this happens the two sides are able to sort things out and resume being bitterly deadlocked.\n\nAs Election Day approaches, a consensus forms among the experts in the media-political complex, based on a vast array of demographic and scientific polling data evaluated with sophisticated analytical tools. These experts, who have made lucrative careers out of going on TV and explaining America to Americans, overwhelmingly agree that Hillary Clinton will win, possibly in a landslide, and this could very well mean the end of the Republican Party. The Explainers are very sure of this, nodding in unison while smiling in bemusement at the pathetic delusions of the Trump people. Unfortunately, it turns out that a large sector of the American public has not been brought up to speed on all this expert analysis. And so it comes to pass that the unthinkable happens, in the form of ...\n\nDecem-\n\nNo, damn it! We have to do this! What happens in ...\n\nNovember\n\n... is that Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, unless this turns out to be one of those really vivid dreams, like the one where you\u2019re at the dentist but you\u2019re naked and your dentist is Bette Midler and spiders keep coming out of your mouth.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory stuns the nation. Not since the darkest days of the Civil War have so many Americans unfriended each other on Facebook. Some even take the extreme step of writing \u201copen letters.\u201d Angry, traumatized protesters cry, march, shout, smash windows, set fires \u2014 and that\u2019s just the New York Times editorial board. Leading celebrities who vowed to leave the country if Trump won immediately start making plans to ... okay, to not actually leave the country per se, but next time they definitely will and YOU\u2019LL BE SORRY.\n\nIn Washington, Democrats who believed in a strong president wielding power via executive orders instantly exchange these deeply held convictions with Republicans who until Election Day at roughly 10 p.m. Eastern time believed fervently in filibusters and limited government.\n\nOn TV, the professional Explainers, having failed spectacularly to predict what just happened, pause for a period of somber and contrite self-reflection lasting close to 15 minutes before they begin the crucial work of explaining to the rest of us what will happen next.\n\nJoe Biden lies awake nights, staring at the ceiling.\n\nMeanwhile a somber Trump, preparing to assume the most powerful office on the planet, puts the pettiness of the campaign behind him and \u2014 facing a world rife with turmoil \u2014 gets down to the all-important work of taking Twitter shots at the cast of \u201cHamilton.\u201d He also begins assembling a Cabinet that \u2014 reflecting the diversity of the nation he has been elected to lead \u2014 includes several non-billionaires. The president-elect also receives classified briefings, during which he learns, among other things, that there are a LOT of foreign countries, including some where he does not even have golf courses.\n\nMeanwhile the Democrats, now on a multi-year losing streak that has cost them the presidency, both houses of Congress and a majority of the state legislatures, desperately seek an explanation for their party\u2019s failures. After a hard, critical look in the mirror, they are forced, reluctantly, to stop seeking scapegoats and place the blame where it belongs: the electoral college, the Russians, Facebook and of course James Comey.\n\nIn the month\u2019s biggest non-election news, the death of Fidel Castro is greeted with expressions of sorrow from several dozen world leaders who never had to live under his rule, and tears of happiness from many thousands of Cubans who did.\n\nAs the bitter and tumultuous month finally draws to a close, Americans briefly stop fighting over politics and come together to celebrate Thanksgiving in the same way the Pilgrims did in 1623: fighting over flat-screen TVs.\n\nBut the focus turns back to politics in\u2026\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Mark Ward /For The Washington Post)\n\nDecember\n\n... during which Trump continues to dominate the news, his face appearing 24/7 on every channel including the Food Network, even when the TV is turned off.\n\nEarly in the month the president-elect ruffles the feathers of the Chinese government when \u2014 in what is viewed as a departure from diplomatic protocol \u2014 he texts Beijing a poop emoji. Also he threatens a drone strike against Alec Baldwin.\n\nBut the big story continues to be the Trump Cabinet. His choice for secretary of defense is James N. \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, who impresses Trump with his sophisticated understanding of modern military strategy and also by biting the head off a live hamster. Most of the drama, however, involves the herd of hopefuls auditioning for secretary of state, including former Trump foe Mitt Romney, who dons wingtip kneepads for his pilgrimage to Trump Tower, after which he explains to the press that his previous criticisms of Trump have been taken out of context, particularly his use of the phrase \u201cscum toad,\u201d which Romney says he meant \u201cin the spirit of constructive dialogue.\u201d\n\nChris Christie dines alone in a Golden Corral in Freehold, N.J., pondering whether to accept the ambassadorship to Belize.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post, seeking to improve their understanding of pro-Trump America, partner with TV network news divisions to create \u201cOperation Outreach,\u201d in which teams of reporters will travel to non-coastal regions carrying rucksacks full of chewing tobacco and moon pies, which they will trade with the natives in return for colorful quotes about their political views, religious beliefs, sex practices involving livestock, etc.\n\nMeanwhile abroad:\n\n\u25cf French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announces that he will not seek reelection, leading professional pollsters to predict, based on scientific analysis of the data, that he will win in a landslide.\n\n\u25cf In a disturbing development, North Korean troops mass near the South Korean border armed with what intelligence sources identify as \u201ca large quantity of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s.\u201d\n\nFinally, mercifully, 2016 draws to a close. On New Year\u2019s Eve, a festive crowd gathers in Times Square, and millions more tune in on TV, to watch the ball drop that marks the dawn of the new year. This is one of the great traditions that connect us as a nation, and it serves to remind us that, although we disagree on many things, we are all part of the same big family \u2014 the American family \u2014 and when all is said and done, we hate each other.\n\nThis is what we are thinking as the big lighted ball begins to slowly descend the pole, traveling roughly two feet before it is vaporized by Russian fighter jets.\n\nHappy new year, fellow Americans. It\u2019s going to be exciting.\n\nDave Barry is a Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist and author. His latest book is \u201cBest. State.

On Friday, he used Twitter to applaud Putin\u2019s restrained response to the expulsion by the US of 35 diplomats and the closure of two Russian compounds.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\n\nThe tweet, like many from Trump that seem calculated to shock and offend, caused a predictable media furore. However, it probably will have done nothing to alleviate the difficult political position in which Trump now finds himself.\n\nThe president-elect has been consistently skeptical about the US intelligence consensus that Russia ordered cyber-attacks on Democratic party targets as a way to influence the 2016 election in his favor \u2013 the reason for Obama\u2019s new sanctions. At one point, he suggested the culprit might have been China, another state or even a 400lb man in his bedroom.\n\nOn taking office in January, Trump might therefore be expected to simply end the Obama sanctions. And as president, he could do so; presidential orders can simply be repealed by the executive branch.\n\nBut the situation is not that simple. If Trump did choose to remove the sanctions, he would find himself at odds with his own party. Senior Republicans in Congress responded to the Obama sanctions by identifying Russia as a major geopolitical foe and criticizing the new measures only as a case of too little too late. Some promised a push for further measures in Congress.\n\nTrump may therefore choose not to reverse the new sanctions. If so, he will find himself at odds with the man he so constantly praises.\n\nOn Friday, the Kremlin responded to the moves, including the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence operatives and the closing of two Russian facilities in the US, with a shrug. Putin, it seems, is willing simply to wait until Trump moves into the Oval Office. Trump\u2019s tweet suggested he is too.\n\nBut such provocative words could not distract the media and public from another domestic concern for Trump \u2013 the growing perception that his predecessor has acted to his disadvantage.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions were clearly an attempt by the Obama administration to throw a wrench into \u2013 or [to] box in \u2013 the next administration\u2019s relationship with Russia,\u201d said Boris Zilberman, a Russia expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n\u201cPutin, in part, saw through that and sidestepped it by playing good cop to [Russian foreign minister Sergey] Lavrov and the [state] Duma, who were calling for a reciprocal response.\u201d\n\nTrump will also face pressure from intelligence agencies, which have concluded that Moscow ordered the election cyber-attacks.\n\nIs Obama using Russia to force a wedge between Trump and his party? | David Klion Read more\n\n\u201cThere is now a public record of what Russia did and why they did it,\u201d said Zachary Goldman, executive director of New York University Law School\u2019s Center on Law and Security, referring to a joint Department of Homeland Security and FBI report issued on Thursday.\n\n\u201cEven if the sanctions can be unwound, you can\u2019t make that public statement go away.\u201d\n\nGoldman also noted an international element to the situation facing Trump. It is important to note, he said, that the new executive order enables Obama and his successors to take retaliatory action against efforts to influence elections held by \u201callies and partners\u201d. Germany and France will hold elections in 2017.\n\nOn a call with reporters on Thursday, a senior White House official said the US had \u201cevery indication\u201d that Russia would continue to pursue such cyber-attacks.\n\n\n\n\u2018All Americans should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s actions\u2019\n\nOn the same call, officials expressed confidence that the political risk of appearing to cave in to Moscow would prevent any future administration from unwinding the sanctions.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf a future president decided that he wanted to allow in a large tranche of Russian intelligence agents, presumably a future president could invite that action,\u201d a senior official said.\n\n\u201cWe think it would be inadvisable. As my colleague just said, these diplomatic compounds were being used for intelligence purposes. That is a direct challenge to US national security, and I don\u2019t think it would make much sense to reopen Russian intelligence compounds.\u201d\n\nIn his own statement, President Obama said: \u201cAll Americans should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nIn response, Trump repeated his contention that the issue should be left behind, that Americans should be able to \u201cget on with our lives\u201d. But he did agree to meet intelligence officials next week, to be \u201cupdated on the facts\u201d.\n\nIn a transition team call on Friday, the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, did not give details of when that meeting would take place or who would attend. No talks were planned with Moscow, he said.\n\nUnderlining the challenges awaiting Trump in his own party, most senior Republicans criticized the Obama administration only for acting too slowly.\n\nOn Thursday, the Arizona senator John McCain and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham said in a joint statement: \u201cThe retaliatory measures announced by the Obama administration today are long overdue.\n\n\u201cBut ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.\u201d\n\nUS expulsions put spotlight on Russia's GRU intelligence agency Read more\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed, saying: \u201cThe Russians are not our friends. And clearly the Obama administration has not yet dissuaded them from attempting to breach our cybersecurity systems, or harass our diplomats in Moscow.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, it was reported that McCain, a member of the Senate armed services committee, had scheduled a hearing on foreign cyber threats for 5 January, and called senior intelligence officials to testify.\n\nAnalysts were also concerned not with whether the sanctions should have been imposed at all, but rather whether the White House had acted quickly enough, and whether its eventual response was strong enough.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions are targeted, not sectoral, and will have a very limited impact,\u201d said Thomas Wright, a fellow and director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institute. \u201cThis will not deter Putin from interfering in French or German elections in 2017.\u201d\n\nThough the strength, timing and effect of the new sanctions are contested, Trump faces a bipartisan consensus.

(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nThe Obama administration announced sweeping new measures against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for what U.S. officials have characterized as interference in this fall\u2019s presidential election, ordering the expulsion of Russian \u201cintelligence operatives\u201d and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of U.S. computer systems.\n\nThe response, unveiled just weeks before President Obama leaves office, culminates months of internal debate over how to react to Russia\u2019s election-year provocations. In recent months, the FBI and CIA have concluded that Russia intervened repeatedly in the 2016 election, leaking damaging information in an attempt to undermine the electoral process and help Donald Trump take the White House.\n\nBecause Thursday\u2019s announcement is an executive action, it can be undone by the next administration. But Obama\u2019s last-minute measures put pressure on Trump, who has largely waved off the allegations against Russia, to make a decision about whether to keep the punitive measures in place.\n\nIn a statement issued by his transition office late Thursday, Trump was noncommittal, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d he said, \u201cin the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken together, the sanctions and expulsions announced Thursday were the most far-reaching U.S. response to Russian activities since the end of the Cold War, and the most specific related to Russian hacking. The administration also released a listing of addresses of computers linked to the Russian cyberattacks and samples of malware inserted into U.S. systems.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have called on the administration for months to respond, saying that tougher measures needed to be taken to punish Russia. The White House resisted acting ahead of the election for fear of appearing partisan.\n\nObama, who had promised a tough U.S. response, said the new actions were \u201ca necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests.\u201d He said Americans should be \u201calarmed\u201d by an array of Russian moves, including interference in the election and harassment of U.S. diplomats overseas.\n\n\u201cSuch activities have consequences,\u201d the president said in a statement.\n\nThe new measures include sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, three companies that are believed to have provided support for government cyber operations, and four Russian cyber officials. The two agencies named are the GRU, Russia\u2019s military spy service, and the civilian spy agency FSB, a successor to the KGB.\n\nThe administration has also ordered 35 Russian operatives to leave the United States and will shut down Russian-owned facilities on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore and on Long Island in New York believed to have been used for intelligence purposes.\n\nState Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said the diplomatic retaliation was partly a response to Russian provocations against American personnel in Russia, including \u201carbitrary police stops, physical \u00adassault, and the broadcast on state TV of personal details about our personnel that put them at risk.\u201d\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nIn June, a senior U.S. diplomat was attacked by a Russian soldier at the doorway to the U.S. Embassy as he tried to enter. That incident, circulated on video, resulted in the earlier expulsion of two Russian diplomats from Washington. The State Department also said that personal details about U.S. diplomats were publicly released in Moscow, and that the Russian government had refused to approve security upgrades to the U.S. diplomatic facility in St. Petersburg.\n\nObama suggested Thursday that the United States may undertake covert activity in response to Russian activities. Officials gave no details. The Treasury Department also designated two Russian hackers, Evgeny Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, for criminal cyber-activities involving U.S. firms and unrelated to the election hacks.\n\nMoscow, which has denied involvement in attacks related to the election, vowed to respond in kind.\n\n\u201cI cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,\u201d Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement late Thursday evening carried by the Interfax news service.\n\nPeskov said the response would be authorized by President Vladimir Putin. In virtually all previous cases of Soviet or Russian diplomats declared persona non grata in this country, an equal number of U.S. officials have been expelled from Russia.\n\n[Read the executive order released by the White House]\n\nTrump has called on the Obama administration to present proof of Russian hacking. Speaking Thursday before the reprisal announcement, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Trump\u2019s views on the hacking allegations could change if more solid evidence emerges that Russia was responsible.\n\n\u201cIf the United States has clear proof of anyone interfering with our elections, we should make that known,\u201d Spicer said, adding, \u201cRight now we need to see further facts.\u201d\n\nSpicer also said that some on the political left were using the Russia allegations to downplay Trump\u2019s victory at the polls on Nov. 8.\n\n[Kremlin spokesman vows retaliation against U.S. sanctions]\n\nU.S. officials say they have been refining for months their assessment of the attacks, in which they say a Russian military intelligence agency hacked the Democratic National Committee and stole emails that were later released by WikiLeaks. Emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, who chaired Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, also were made public. State electoral systems were also targeted, but administration officials said Thursday, as they have in the past, that they have no evidence the actual voting process was interfered with on Election Day.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have not named Putin himself in the \u00adcyber-meddling, Obama has suggested that approval came from the very top of the Russian government.\n\nAs part of the new measures, the administration has amended a 2015 executive order allowing the president to respond to foreign cyberattacks.\n\nThat order was intended primarily for attacks against infrastructure or commercial targets, but officials adapted it to cover attempts to undermine the electoral process \u2014 not only in the United States but in other countries as well.\n\nIn a call with reporters, U.S. officials said they chose to announce the new measures before the end of Obama\u2019s term in an attempt to educate Americans about Russian activities and to deter future intrusions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe Russia will interfere with future U.S. elections and future elections around the world,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity \u00adbecause he was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\n\u201cThe Russian actions have been sustained over an extended period of time, and by any definition are against the national interests of the United States, not the interests of President Obama.\u201d The harassment, the official said, \u201chas been escalating steadily for some time\u201d and is \u201ca direct threat to the ability of the United States to conduct diplomacy.\u201d\n\nBoth U.S. allies and American businesses were concerned about Russian activities, the official said, and \u201cif [Trump transition officials] aren\u2019t, then they should explain why.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration also released a document providing some details about the cyber operation U.S. officials have labeled \u201cGrizzly Steppe,\u201d including a list of names the hackers used.\n\nThese groups have conducted campaigns against think tanks, universities and corporations, as well as government agencies, according to the administration. In foreign countries, they have carried out damaging and disruptive cyberattacks, including on electrical utilities.\n\nJohn Carlin, former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, said the measures announced Thursday were significant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to show that we can do attribution and are willing to impose a deterrent \u2014 not just for the Russians, but for the world, as we\u2019re figuring out what the norms should be in cyberspace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a world of free passes.\u201d\n\nIdentifying the malware that was used, imposing sanctions and affecting the Russians\u2019 ability to hack for intelligence purposes all \u201craise the cost\u201d of conducting such activities, Carlin said.\n\nThe Obama administration has already imposed sanctions on Russia for its activities in Ukraine, but those measures do not appear to have deterred Russia\u2019s actions there.\n\nCongressional Republicans welcomed the crackdown but said it was overdue.\n\n\u201cIt is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement.\n\nSens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the measures were inadequate and promised to fight for stronger sanctions.\n\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to deliver an 11th-hour blow against Russia, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament, suggested the measures would not inflict lasting damage.\n\n\u201cNone of this will change the results of the election of the American president, and in January, the rightful owner of the White House will be Donald Trump,\u201d Slutsky said. \u201cI expect that with his arrival the dialogue between Russia and the United States will be conducted in a more healthy political atmosphere.\u201d\n\nDavid Filipov and Andrew Roth in Moscow and John Wagner in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nPutin to Democratic Party: You lost, get over it\n\nFBI in agreement with CIA that Russia aimed to help Trump win White House\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/12/29/National-Security/Images/Obama_45496.jpg-64d35.jpg", "title": "Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election interference", "summary": "Several lawmakers have called on the administration for months to respond, saying that tougher measures needed to be taken to punish Russia.\nThe Obama administration has already imposed sanctions on Russia for its activities in Ukraine, but those measures do not appear to have deterred Russia\u2019s actions there.\n[Read the executive order released by the White House]Trump has called on the Obama administration to present proof of Russian hacking.\nAs part of the new measures, the administration has amended a 2015 executive order allowing the president to respond to foreign cyberattacks.\nObama suggested Thursday that the United States may undertake covert activity in response to Russian activities.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Ellen Nakashima Is A National Security Reporter For The Washington Post She Focuses On Issues Relating To Intelligence Technology Civil Liberties", "Karen Deyoung Is Associate Editor Senior National Security Correspondent For The Washington Post", "Missy Ryan Writes About The Pentagon Military Issues National Security For The Washington Post"], "keywords": ["united", "officials", "punish", "measures", "interference", "response", "administration", "election", "announces", "russian", "white", "2016", "russia", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-28 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/us/politics/john-kerry-israel-democrats-republicans.html", "text": "A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers, upset with President Obama\u2019s decision last week to allow the passage of a United Nations resolution condemning Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in disputed territory, made clear that they were looking past the departing administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Benjamin L.

The sit-in stretched from June 22 into the morning hours of June 23. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nFor now, it seems, the one lasting impact of House Democrats' 26-hour sit-in on gun control this summer is Republicans' desire to punish them for it.\n\nBut figuring out a way to do that without fanning the flames of the gun control debate \u2014 not to mention angering gun control advocates who are more and more willing to fight fire with fire \u2014 could be politically tricky.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has every incentive to make sure the minority party doesn't ever again seize the floor. There's no such thing as a filibuster in the House of Representatives; what happens on the House floor is supposed to be unilaterally within his team's control, and for 26 hours in June, it wasn't.\n\n[7 big moments from House Democrats' overnight sit-in]\n\nBut any punitive measures Ryan takes could play into Democrats' hands.\n\nDemocrats have struggled to turn their sit-in into any meaningful action. No post-Orlando gun control legislation passed Congress this year. Democrats didn't win big at the ballot box, either: They only gained six seats in the House despite expectations of up to 20 pickups, and Republicans kept their majorities in Congress and historically large majorities in state governments, too.\n\nDespite historic efforts by Democrats, gun control has largely faded from the national conversation. Until now.\n\nDemocrats are practically begging Ryan to do something. No punishment had been doled out Tuesday, and already some Democrats were acting as if they had been punished. Here's one of the leaders of the sit-in, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), on Monday:\n\n.@HouseGOP wants to fine me, @RepBetoORourke & @RepScottPeters for filming #gunviolence sit-in. I'll always stand w/ victims. Bring.It.On. \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) December 26, 2016\n\nNo surprise, then, that Ryan has decided to go a more roundabout way that doesn't directly lay the blame on any lawmaker. We learned Tuesday that one of the first things on his to-do list in January is to pass a rule authorizing the House's top cop to levy a fine, up to $2,500, on any lawmaker who shoots video or takes photos on the House floor. This rule would apply to future breaches of action and enforce already existing rules about having phones on the House floor (you're not supposed to).\n\n\"These changes will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House of Representatives so lawmakers can do the people\u2019s work,\" said his spokesperson, AshLee Strong.\n\nBut here, too, Ryan finds himself potentially backing into a corner: Democrats could actually claim this more mundane procedural move is unconstitutional.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office told Politico's Rachael Bade they are looking into whether such a rule passes muster under the Constitution. Bade spoke with several constitutional experts who said that giving a House officer the power to punish lawmakers could be cause for concern. (A long-accepted interpretation of the Constitution is that only the full House, via a vote, has the authority to punish a lawmaker.)\n\nRyan isn't singling out any one lawmaker for martyrdom, but the tweets and releases from Democrats and gun control advocates write themselves: \u201cRepublicans are trying to unconstitutionally punish us for their efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals!\u201d\n\nWe should reiterate that you're already not supposed to take pictures or shoot video on the House floor. In fact, you're not even supposed to have your phone out on the House floor (though lawmakers frequently break that rule on an average day).\n\nLive streaming became House Democrats' only option to broadcast their sit-in, since the C-SPAN cameras cut off shortly after their protest began. (And no, Republicans didn't directly cut the cord; the cameras are turned off as a matter of procedure when the House isn't in session, and Democrats essentially forced the House out of session by seizing the floor.)\n\nThe decision ended up being a great PR move for House Democrats. The shaky, grainy Periscope feed coming from lawmakers' phones only heightened national interest in the sit-in. As the sit-in headed into prime-time TV hours, the live stream was airing on nearly every major cable news channel. Ryan tried and failed several times to shut it down, with thousands on the Internet watching.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) gaveled the House into session just after 10 p.m. on June 22, after a daylong sit-in by Democratic members, but it was far from orderly. (C-SPAN)\n\nMore than six months later, that chaotic moment feels like a distant memory. (Exit polling on how gun control factored into Americans' vote is scant, but it's notable the highest-ranking pro-gun-control candidate, Hillary Clinton, didn't win.)\n\nExcept here we are talking about it again.\n\nRyan has every reason to want to punish lawmakers who seized the floor.

Others accused her of using her family nonprofit as a slush fund and argued that the longtime politician was the quintessential emblem of the status quo, not the change agent she portrayed herself to be.\n\nAnd Trump, who vanquished a crowded field of 16 additional Republicans \u2014 including current and former senators and governors \u2014 before toppling Clinton, is skeptical that anyone could have bested him, including an incumbent president.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday afternoon. \u201cHe should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.\u201d\n\nTrump railed against Obama and Clinton\u2019s policies on the campaign trail. He ran on the promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare, dubbed Obama and Clinton the founders of the Islamic State and slammed them for having supported free trade policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and NAFTA.\n\nClinton prevailed in the popular vote, winning nearly 3 million more ballots across the country than Trump. But it was Trump's improbable campaign that won the requisite number of Electoral College votes to be elected president, and he maintains he could have won the popular vote, too, had that been his aim.\n\nBy Obama\u2019s assessment, Clinton performed \u201cwonderfully under really tough circumstances.\u201d But there were problems: Obama accused the media of \u201cwildly\u201d amplifying Clinton\u2019s flaws because of a double standard and said Democrats weren\u2019t on the ground where they needed to be to show people in rural communities that the Democratic Party cares about them, too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an emotional connection, and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there, and that means organizing, that means caring about state parties, it means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day,\u201d Obama told Axelrod.\n\nNow, with Trump weeks away from being sworn in as the next president, the theme of \u201chope\u201d that carried the Obamas into the White House in 2008 has emerged as the concept they\u2019re tightly grasping onto as they transition out eight years later.\n\n\u201cSee, now, we\u2019re feeling what not having hope feels like,\u201d Michelle Obama told Oprah Winfrey in her own exit interview, broadcast last week.\n\nThe first lady cast hope as a \u201cnecessary concept\u201d that wasn\u2019t just a nice slogan for votes but something she and her husband believe in.\n\nFor his part, Trump told supporters at a thank-you rally in Mobile, Alabama, that they have \u201ctremendous hope\u201d and suggested the first lady \u201cmade that statement not meaning it the way it came out.\u201d\n\nIt is Trump, after all, who appears to represent the change Americans want today. Eschewing political correctness and largely self-funding his primary campaign, Trump was undeniably a shift from the status quo. Voters hoped he would come to Washington, shake things up and \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d as he said on the trail.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s podcast, Obama credited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for Republicans\u2019 obstruction throughout his entire administration, an effort, he argued, that was meant to obscure the hope and change he campaigned on by rejecting his policies outright and creating stagnation.\n\nAccording to Obama, McConnell\u2019s view was \u201cthat if we just say no, then that will puncture the balloon,\u201d and \u201call this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we can \u2014 if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House and win back seats in the Senate,\u201d Obama continued, relaying his understanding of McConnell\u2019s message.\n\nThat strategy worked: Republicans retook the House after the 2010 midterms and reclaimed the Senate in 2014 \u2014 majorities they retained following the Nov. 8 election.\n\nObama said he understood what happened politically but insists his message from 2008 still resonates.\n\n\u201cObviously, in the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that, somehow, it really was a fantasy,\u201d he said, referring to the message of hope and change. \u201cWhat I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism. And the problem is, it doesn't always manifest itself in politics, right?\u201d", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201612/656/1155968404_5262771909001_5262769347001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "title": "Obama: I could have won a third term", "summary": "Obama: I could have won a third term The president says the message of hope and change he campaigned on in 2008 still resonates in 2016.\n\u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\u201cSee, now, we\u2019re feeling what not having hope feels like,\u201d Michelle Obama told Oprah Winfrey in her own exit interview, broadcast last week.\nAll of his administration\u2019s accomplishments would be reversed under a President Trump, he warned.\nObama said he understood what happened politically but insists his message from 2008 still resonates.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Andrew Restuccia", "Nolan D", "Nancy Cook"], "keywords": ["term", "clinton", "trump", "say", "state", "won", "hope", "president", "told", "change", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-26 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/26/rnc-clarifies-part-christmas-message-after-social-media-criticism.html", "text": "A Republican National Committee official lashed out at critics after part of a Christmas statement it made Sunday sparked outrage on social media.\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus released a three-paragraph statement on the holiday, but it was the first paragraph that drew critics\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cOver two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind.

Indeed, the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel, more than any other action, could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks. Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel, and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated.\"\n\nPower said that in addition to condemning settlements, the resolution \"reflects the facts on the ground,\" condemns violence and terrorism and addresses \"counter-productive actions by the Palestinians\" while also calling on both sides to engage in peace talks.\n\nThe U.S. abstention comes one day after President-elect Trump issued a statement calling on the U.S. to veto the resolution.\n\n\"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" Trump said.

He had told reporters Thursday morning they could expect \u201cfurther announcements on appointments and staff later today\u201d and additional announcements \u201cin the near future on fulfilling the final Cabinet positions.\u201d\n\nHe and Miller, the transition team\u2019s communications director, host daily briefings with the press on Trump\u2019s schedule and take questions.\n\nHicks, the transition\u2019s press secretary, and Scavino, the transition\u2019s social media director, have been with Trump since he launched his campaign, serving the same role through the campaign and transition \u2014 and, in Scavino's case, into the White House, too.\n\nTrump likely made his final deliberations Wednesday. Miller said Trump spent Wednesday holding \u201cinternal staff meetings\u201d at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he will remain over the Christmas holiday.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House communications staff will likely differ significantly from President Barack Obama\u2019s team. Obama, for instance, largely relies on his staff to tweet out his message. Trump, however, likes to control his own message, often casting 140-character-or-less missives from his personal Android phone \u2014 and his transition team generally opts to tell the press that his tweets speak for themselves rather than attempt to explain the rationale behind them or provide any context.\n\nConway took issue last week with current White House press secretary Josh Earnest\u2019s performance behind the lectern after the Obama administration spokesman suggested Trump, who has repeatedly denied U.S. intelligence that Russia meddled in the presidential election, knew Russia was responsible for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s personal email account.\n\n\u201cI guess he\u2019s auditioning to be a political pundit after his job is over soon,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThat is incredibly disappointing to hear from the podium of the White House press secretary.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s transition team has already signaled to the White House press corps that change is coming. Priebus told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last week that Trump\u2019s team might shake things up.\n\n\u201cI think that many things have to change, and I think that it\u2019s important that we look at all of those traditions that are great, but quite frankly, as you know, don\u2019t really make news,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just sort of mundane, boring episodes. And you know, even looking at things like the daily White House briefing from the press secretary, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of different ways that things can be done, and I can assure you we\u2019re looking at that.\u201d\n\nEven reserved seating, which Priebus incorrectly asserted wasn\u2019t an issue until the Obama administration took over, could get reshaped.\n\n\u201cThe point of all of this conversation is that the traditions, while some of them are great, I think it\u2019s time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House, and I can assure you that change is going to happen, even on things that might seem boring like this topic,\u201d he said.\n\n", "image": "http://static.politico.com/ea/5a/3d76f6724b54a61c7bec5c1b0eee/12-22-sean-spicer-1-gty-629.jpg", "title": "Trump names his White House communications team", "summary": "| Getty Trump names his White House communications teamTop transition aides will serve as senior members of the incoming White House communications staff, including Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer as press secretary, President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday.\n\u201cThat is incredibly disappointing to hear from the podium of the White House press secretary.\u201dAnd Trump\u2019s transition team has already signaled to the White House press corps that change is coming.\nTrump\u2019s White House communications staff will likely differ significantly from President Barack Obama\u2019s team.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Sean Spicer his White House press secretary.\nSpicer, the Republican National Committee\u2019s communications director and chief strategist, has worked as a senior communications adviser to Trump during the transition.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Burgess Everett", "Nolan D", "Hadas Gold"], "keywords": ["things", "trump", "campaign", "house", "transition", "communications", "names", "team", "press", "white", "staff"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-22 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/12/22/official-donald-trump-hires-kellyanne-conway-councilor-president/", "text": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump wants his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway to be the Counselor to the President in his administration.\n\nAccording to the campaign, Conway will continue serving Trump as a close adviser working with senior leadership to effectively message and execute the administration\u2019s legislative priorities and actions.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cKellyanne Conway has been a trusted advisor and strategist who played a crucial role in my victory,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cShe is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message.

On Tuesday evening, the Islamic State issued a statement through its Amaq news agency describing the driver of the truck as \u201ca soldier.\u201d But the group offered no other details about the driver\u2019s identity, or whether he had directly interacted with it or was just sympathetic to it.\n\nThe day began with what seemed to be a breakthrough, as the authorities announced that they were interrogating a 23-year-old Pakistani asylum seeker, arrested the previous night, who arrived in Germany last December. Yet within hours, doubts arose that he was the perpetrator, and by evening the federal prosecutor said the man had been released because there was no evidence linking him to the crime. An examination of the cab of the truck turned up no sign that he had been in it, the prosecutor said.\n\nVideo\n\nThe attack came at a precarious moment in Germany, amid concerns about Russian meddling in domestic politics and a still angry populist backlash against Ms. Merkel over her decision to open the German border to nearly a million migrants and refugees in 2015. Across Europe on Tuesday, where the threat of terrorism is now a factor in daily life, a familiar anxiety seemed evident in some major cities. Central Rome appeared oddly empty only days after shoppers had filled many streets.\n\nIn Berlin, several hundred people attended an emotional service held between the wooden stalls of the Christmas market, located beside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a symbolic site whose spire, jagged from bomb damage, was intentionally left unrepaired after World War II. Among those who came were a group of 60 to 70 members of a local mosque.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to show our solidarity,\u201d said Hasnen Ahmad, a member of the group, \u201cand that our community stands for peace.\u201d\n\nThroughout the day, the German authorities expanded their investigation, even as they offered few details and apparently made fewer breakthroughs. At one point, the authorities pleaded with the public to turn over any videos or other evidence taken from the market during the attack.\n\nA basic chronology did emerge: The attacker first hijacked a heavy truck belonging to a Polish company that was en route to Berlin bearing a load of steel girders. At some point, he apparently killed the driver and then, with the body still in the cab, sped east past Berlin\u2019s Zoo Station and onto Budapester Strasse, a main thoroughfare.\n\nAround 8 p.m. Monday, the driver swerved off the street and plowed through the Christmas market, steering between the rows of temporary wooden stands, which typically sell items such as handmade Christmas ornaments or mulled wine. Like most Christmas markets in Germany, this one was packed with shoppers, who suddenly tried to flee in horror.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter traveling at least 50 yards, striking scores of people and leaving behind a trail of shattered wood and glass, the truck swerved back toward the street, coming to a stop after it struck a wooden structure, according to German news reports.\n\nPhoto\n\nGerman officials are normally tight-lipped about high-profile investigations, preferring to withhold any information until they have clear answers. Little was known about the 12 victims of the attacks, or about the wounded, though an Italian and an Israeli may have been among the victims.\n\nFabrizia Di Lorenzo, an Italian transportation specialist who has been living in Germany for three years, was missing and her father feared the worst after her cellphone and transit pass were found near the market.\n\n\u201cWe are here with my wife, waiting for the DNA results,\u201d Gaetano Di Lorenzo told Corriere della Serra, an Italian newspaper. \u201cWe are waiting for confirmation, but I am not deluding myself.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the attack \u201cmay have claimed the life of an Israeli citizen,\u201d a reference to a missing woman, Dalia Elkayam, whose husband, Rami Elkayam, was injured in the episode.\n\nAriel Zurawski, the head of the Polish company that owned the truck, said the man found dead inside the cab was his cousin Lukasz, who was 37 and married with a child.\n\nMr. Zurawski said that Lukasz had been driving a shipment of construction materials to Berlin from Italy and that he had identified him from police photographs of the dead man. German officials declined to give further information on the victim.\n\nThe arrest of the Pakistani suspect came after a witness told the police that he had seen a suspect jump from the truck. The witness tried to follow him through a nearby park to where he was arrested.\n\nVideo\n\nPolitical opponents of Ms. Merkel quickly seized on his status as an asylum seeker to renew their criticism that her migration policies had made Germany vulnerable to terrorism \u2014 before the man was cleared of suspicion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGermany is no longer safe,\u201d declared Frauke Petry, the leader of the Alternative for Germany party. Noting the successive terrorist attacks in France, including the Nice attack in July, Ms. Petry called the carnage at the Berlin market \u201cnot just an attack on our freedom and our way of life, but also on our Christian tradition.\u201d\n\nDaniela Schwarzer, the leader of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said the harsh reaction offered a taste of the bitter debate to come in 2017.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to their appeals for tips or crime scene video, officials also pleaded with people to avoid posting them on social media outlets.\n\nSecurity officials have been warning that Germany remains in the sights of terrorists, without naming any specific threats. Coming as many families were winding down their work for the year and readying holiday festivities, the attack left the country in subdued shock. Other Christmas markets in the city were closed on Tuesday, and flags were lowered to half-staff.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTwelve people were among us yesterday and were happy about Christmas and the holidays,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThis is incomprehensible, this act that robbed them of their lives.\u201d\n\nShe urged people not to bow to fear and suspicion, telling Germans they must continue to uphold their traditions, even when faced with the reality that democracy is vulnerable. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do without Christmas markets, without nice outings together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not wish to let fear and angst take away our freedom to live.\u201d\n\nThomas de Maizi\u00e8re, Germany\u2019s interior minister, said that there would be increased security in public places and at key transit hubs, and that local officials would make decisions about events that might need to be curtailed for safety reasons.\n\nOfficials have been aware for some time of the risk of attacks on holiday-themed events in Europe. The State Department issued a travel alert on Nov. 21 recommending that Americans \u201cexercise caution at holiday festivals, events and outdoor markets\u201d throughout the Continent.\n\n\u201cCredible information\u201d indicated that the Islamic State, its affiliates and sympathizers \u201ccontinue to plan terrorist attacks in Europe, with a focus on the upcoming holiday season and associated events,\u201d the alert said.\n\nThroughout Tuesday, Berlin residents bearing flowers and candles placed them at makeshift memorials on either side of the church. Oliver Horn said he had written the slogan \u201cM\u00eame pas peur\u201d (French for \u201cNot even afraid\u201d), from the aftermath of the Nice attacks, on a poster and hung it near the site on his way to work on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt just came to my mind,\u201d he said of the gesture. \u201cI felt I had to do something.\u201d\n\nThe sign caught the attention of Cyril Leteuil, who was visiting Berlin from Bordeaux. \u201cIt\u2019s just like Nice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in France.\u201d", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/21/world/21Germany3/21Germany3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "Germany Releases Berlin Attack Suspect as ISIS Claims Involvement", "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cTwelve people were among us yesterday and were happy about Christmas and the holidays,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\nLike most Christmas markets in Germany, this one was packed with shoppers, who suddenly tried to flee in horror.\n\u201cI felt I had to do something.\u201dThe sign caught the attention of Cyril Leteuil, who was visiting Berlin from Bordeaux.\nThroughout Tuesday, Berlin residents bearing flowers and candles placed them at makeshift memorials on either side of the church.\nThe arrest of the Pakistani suspect came after a witness told the police that he had seen a suspect jump from the truck.", "source": "New York Times", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Melissa Eddy", "Alison Smale"], "keywords": ["truck", "isis", "releases", "german", "merkel", "attack", "attacks", "berlin", "continue", "involvement", "ms", "claims", "suspect", "germany", "christmas"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-19 00:00:00", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/12/19/with-electoral-college-set-to-vote-today-americans-show-little-support-for-revolt-n2261344", "text": "In state capitols across the country on Monday, the 538 members of the Electoral College will almost certainly formalize President-elect Trump\u2019s win.

Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), center, leaves Trump Tower earlier this month. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget, signaling his intent to slash spending and address the deficit as president.\n\nMulvaney, 49, was elected to Congress in 2010 in the wave that brought a cohort of younger, staunchly conservative members into the House. Mulvaney quickly staked out ground as one of Congress\u2019s most outspoken fiscal hawks \u2014 playing a key role in the 2011 showdown between President Obama and House Republicans that ended in the passage of strict budget caps.\n\nHe has been an advocate for spending cuts, often taking on his own party to push for more aggressive curbs to government spending.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cRight now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation\u2019s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.\n\n\u201cWith Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America\u2019s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer\u2019s trust in how their money is spent,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget. Here's what you need to know about the conservative congressman. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has announced plans for increased defense spending in a massive infrastructure bill. Adding Mulvaney to his administration could help ease concerns from fiscal conservatives about the cost of such plans and their effect on the deficit.\n\nA founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen conservative hard-liners that has used its leverage to push Republican leaders to the right, Mulvaney was among the group of lawmakers widely credited with pushing House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) out of power in 2015.\n\nHe has broken with members of his own party at times, particularly around defense spending issues. Mulvaney has been a fierce critic of the use of a separate war funding stream known as overseas contingency operations, a budgetary maneuver used to skirt spending caps to fund military and anti-terror operations abroad. Mulvaney has allied himself with Democrats at times to try to force defense spending cuts.\n\nMulvaney is also an advocate of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\nMulvaney has had largely friendly relations with Boehner\u2019s successor, Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). He was among three members who offered nominating speeches for Ryan in a closed-door House GOP leadership election last month.\n\nIn a statement Ryan praised Mulvaney\u2019s appointment to head OMB.\n\n\u201cMick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIn Congress, he has been a conservative reformer from day one, proposing solutions to fix the budget process and our regulatory system.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt OMB, he will lead the work he has started to improve the way government does the people\u2019s business,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong Mulvaney\u2019s chief duties will be overseeing the most dramatic overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax code since President Ronald Reagan. Trump has pledged to streamline the process for individual households and slash the rate for corporations from 35 percent to 15 percent. The changes are a central component of the administration\u2019s promise to boost economic growth to 4 percent or higher, a message that resonated with voters still bruised by the Great Recession but that many economists say is unsustainable.\n\nIn addition, Trump has said that stronger growth would mean his tax proposal would not contribute to the national debt, and he has vowed not to cut expensive but popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. But experts have been skeptical of those claims, and Mulvaney would be responsible for reconciling the numbers.\n\nOne analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump\u2019s tax plan would cost more than $5.3 trillion over the next decade. Even after factoring in faster economic growth, Trump\u2019s proposals are expected to add at least $2.6 trillion to the debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.\n\nTrump has also called for as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, an investment long sought by Democrats even though GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), remain opposed.\n\nIt is not clear how Trump intends to pay for rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads and bridges. Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross, and economic adviser Peter Navarro have proposed tax credits intended to spur $1 trillion in private spending. But Trump\u2019s website suggests that fulfilling his pledge will require at least some public money, although it does not detail where the funding will come from.\n\nMulvaney has spent the past few years learning Spanish and has been one of just a handful of GOP lawmakers able to appear on Spanish-language television programs to explain and defend Republican policies.\n\nYlan Q.

What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.\n\nLike another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee\u2019s old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.\n\nWhat is phishing? Phishing uses an innocent-looking email to entice unwary recipients to click on a deceptive link, giving hackers access to their information or a network. In \u201cspear-phishing,\u201d the email is tailored to fool a specific person.\n\nAn examination by The Times of the Russian operation \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack, intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response \u2014 reveals a series of missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack.\n\nThe D.N.C.\u2019s fumbling encounter with the F.B.I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House\u2019s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.\n\nThe low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, whose private email account was hacked months later.\n\nEven Mr. Podesta, a savvy Washington insider who had written a 2014 report on cyberprivacy for President Obama, did not truly understand the gravity of the hacking.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy last summer, Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day \u2014 procured by Russian intelligence agents, posted on WikiLeaks and other websites, then eagerly reported on by the American media, including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail.\n\nThe fallout included the resignations of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the D.N.C., and most of her top party aides. Leading Democrats were sidelined at the height of the campaign, silenced by revelations of embarrassing emails or consumed by the scramble to deal with the hacking. Though little-noticed by the public, confidential documents taken by the Russian hackers from the D.N.C.\u2019s sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned up in congressional races in a dozen states, tainting some of them with accusations of scandal.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent days, a skeptical president-elect, the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election, while conceding that other factors \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses as a candidate; her private email server; the public statements of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about her handling of classified information \u2014 were also important.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A low-cost, high-impact weapon that Russia had test-fired in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States, with devastating effectiveness. For Russia, with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of all-out war, cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap, hard to see coming, hard to trace.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d\n\nFor the people whose emails were stolen, this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter, recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices, humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201d\n\nThe United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.\n\nDemocratic House Candidates Were Also Targets of Russian Hacking The fallout for nearly a dozen congressional candidates underscores the effect of the Russian influence operation on the American electoral system.\n\nOver the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed.\n\n\u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201d\n\nA Target for Break-Ins\n\nSitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture.\n\n\u201cGOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair,\u201d reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19, 1972, with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.\n\nAndrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again.\n\nThere were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have.\n\n\u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\n\nThe D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tamene, who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F.B.I. agent, was not a full-time D.N.C. employee; he works for a Chicago-based contracting firm called The MIS Department. He was left to figure out, largely on his own, how to respond \u2014 and even whether the man who had called in to the D.N.C. switchboard was really an F.B.I. agent.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.\n\nIn November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.\n\nMs. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised.\n\nShawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201d\n\nThe F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201d\n\nBy March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn.\n\nA second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.\n\n\u201cSomeone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account,\u201d the March 22 email said, adding that the sign-in attempt had occurred in Ukraine. \u201cGoogle stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button.\n\n\u201cThis is a legitimate email,\u201d Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta\u2019s aides, who had noticed the alert. \u201cJohn needs to change his password immediately.\u201d\n\nWith another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C.\n\nThe F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated.\n\nOne bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.\n\nHoning Stealthy Tactics", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/14/us/14hack-top1-sub/14hack-top1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.", "summary": "meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C.\nobserved this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him.\nSo when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.\nPhotoWhat he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.\nBut when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C.", "source": "New York Times", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["David E", "Scott Shane", "Sanger Scott Shane", "Eric Lipton"], "keywords": ["perfect", "hackers", "dnc", "campaign", "weapon", "american", "tamene", "emails", "invaded", "mr", "russian", "fbi", "cyberpower", "email"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-15 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/15/kremlin-report-putin-meddling-us-election-nonsense/95463716/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemns Russian hacking of U.S. political organizations, as President-elect Donald Trump continues to downplay the CIA\u2019s confidential assessment that Russia hacked into the DNC.

The goal grew into an effort to expose corruption in U.S. politics and to undermine America's international credibility.\n\nThe NBC News report comes after last week's report from The Washington Post, also citing unnamed intelligence sources, which said the CIA believed that Russia not only interfered in the election, but did so with the intention of helping Donald Trump win.\n\nAlthough U.S. intelligence agencies agree Russia was behind several hacks during the campaign, including that of the DNC, the CIA is thus far the only agency reported to have reached the conclusion that the efforts were explicitly meant to benefit Trump.\n\nOn Oct. 7, the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement on behalf of the U.S. Intelligence Community expressing confidence that the \"Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\" The ODNI and FBI do not believe there is enough evidence to conclude the cyber attacks were intended to help Trump win, however.\n\nGiven Putin's authoritarian control over the Russian government, it is logical that any intervention in the U.S. election would have required the former KGB officer's approval. In the October statement, the 17 American intelligence agencies said, \"based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hJEml3", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a7279e333fc9e9c81794e21f5e81176c0d91ba6/c=0-134-4087-2443&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636173447556773623-EPA-RUSSIA-PUTIN.jpg", "title": "Report of Putin meddling in U.S. election is 'ludicrous'", "summary": "\"In Japan, where Putin was on an official visit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also blasted the report as \"ludicrous nonsense.\nThe report by NBC News cited two unnamed \"senior U.S. intelligence officials\" as saying the Russian president personally intervened in the 2016 presidential election.\n(Photo: Alexey Nikolsky, epa)The Kremlin on Thursday dismissed as \"nonsense\" a report by NBC News that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in trying to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n(Dec. 12) APRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with members of the WorldSkills Russian national team in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Dec. 9, 2016.\nNew intelligence links Putin directly to the leaks from hacked Democratic National Committee emails, the officials told NBC News with \"a high level of confidence.", "source": "USA Today", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Published A M Et Dec"], "keywords": ["putin", "trump", "intelligence", "ludicrous", "meddling", "kremlin", "russian", "officials", "election", "report", "president", "nbc", "russia"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-14 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2016/12/14/505472257/should-trump-foes-see-tillerson-at-state-as-last-straw-or-first-ray-of-hope", "text": "Should Trump Foes See Tillerson At State As Last Straw Or First Ray Of Hope?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's Cabinet choices have prompted controversy from the moment they were named, but the one most likely to face real Senate opposition is Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, whom Trump wants as his secretary of state.\n\nHow badly did Trump want Tillerson on his team? Badly enough to defend his pick's remarkable profile as a Russophile, a reputation so vivid that several Republican senators immediately began flashing yellow cards \u2014 if not red.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said being a \"Friend of Vladimir\" was hardly a Cabinet qualification, a reference to Russian President Putin, who once gave Tillerson the \"Order of Friendship\" \u2014 the highest accolade Moscow grants to friendly foreigners.\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain went farther, calling Putin a \"murderer, a thug and a KGB agent,\" a reference to the Russian leader's early career with the Soviet Union's secret police. So was he calling Tillerson a friend of murderers, thugs and KGB agents?\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham added his grave doubts, as well, suggesting there might be enough Republican defections from the GOP's 52-seat majority to block the nomination on the Senate floor.\n\nThis much at least is clear: For all the shade that has been thrown on other Trump Cabinet picks \u2014 from the generals to the Goldman Sachs alumni club \u2014 none seems in as much danger of Senate rejection as the big guy from the Big Oil company.\n\nTrump no doubt knew he would catch flak over Tillerson's Putin ties, but saw them as proof of the Texan's deal-making and globe-trotting savvy. And he was settled enough on his man to stand by him even after the story had broken about the CIA concluding the Russians interfered with the 2016 election with an eye to aiding Trump.\n\nUnder these extraordinary circumstances, many will see the Tillerson pick as Trump doubling down on a potentially explosive departure from Republican orthodoxy. The party that nominated Trump has never been at ease with his defense of Putin as \"a strong leader\" or his divergence from the party's longstanding commitment to NATO. (A more traditional GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, said during the 2012 presidential debates that Russia was the biggest threat to the U.S. on the planet.)\n\nAt the same time, for those who say they like Trump because he sticks to his guns, Tillerson is proof \u2014 and as such he offers a chance to cheer. And for those who prefer a practitioner of private sector realpolitik over a politician or a polished diplomat, Tillerson may fill the bill rather admirably.\n\nFor others, even those implacably opposed to Trump and Tillerson both, this may be a moment to consider the options. Sure, the head of ExxonMobil may be the antithesis of everything you hold dear. Yes, you would have preferred the head of Greenpeace USA. But given that Trump was choosing, what did you expect?\n\nTillerson has drawn predictable pushback from all the proper quarters. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called it \"very troubling ... very sad ... very dangerous,\" because it meant Trump saw \"the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry [as] more important than climate change and the future of the planet.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund said Trump was putting the oil-and-gas industry interests above Americans' health. Government watchdogs, such as Every Voice, were disturbed, because Tillerson owns so much stock in a company active in 50 countries with interests likely to conflict with those of the U.S.\n\nAs an example, Tillerson has opposed the U.S.-NATO sanctions on Russia imposed after the latter annexed Crimea \u2014 after those sanctions blocked his company's plans to drill below the Arctic Sea with Moscow's blessing. That issue will surely be a feature of his confirmation hearings, if not a major stumbling block.\n\nBut elections have consequences, as President Obama was once fond of saying. Tillerson makes sense in a Trumpian world, because he breaks the mold of diplomats and politicians who usually command the U.S. State Department. He has no government experience, but that is surely not disqualifying in the Trump administration.\n\nTrump and Tillerson are two tough-minded corporate businessmen who have spent decades atop large companies with global interests. Both have a penchant for big projects and a professed devotion to the works of philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand.\n\nTrump makes a show of downscale tastes while living in a tower on Fifth Avenue. Tillerson has the versatility to talk Texan while also playing the sophisticated realist who sees the world as something more than us versus them. At ExxonMobil he has led a complex, worldwide organization that at least publicly recognizes the realities of climate change, fossil fuels and alternative energies.\n\nThat veneer of commitment to future technologies will not placate those who see environmental disaster on the horizon.

Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to head the Department of the Interior. Here's what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Danielle Kunitz,Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has tapped Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who has represented Montana\u2019s at-large congressional seat for one term, to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior, according to an individual with firsthand knowledge of the decision.\n\nZinke, who studied geology as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon and served as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008 before entering politics, campaigned for his House seat on a platform of achieving North American energy independence. He sits on the House Natural Resources Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee.\n\nA lifelong hunter and fisherman, the 55-year-old Zinke has defended public access to federal lands even though he frequently votes against environmentalists on issues ranging from coal extraction to oil and gas drilling. This summer, he quit his post as a member of the GOP platform-writing committee after the group included language that would have transferred federal land ownership to the states.\n\n[Trump taps former Texas governor Rick Perry to head Energy Department he once vowed to abolish]\n\n\u201cWhat I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,\u201d Zinke said at the time. \u201cAt this point, I think it\u2019s better to show leadership.\u201d\n\nTrump also opposes such land transfers, but the provision made it into the official Republican platform.\n\nZinke recently criticized an Interior Department rule aimed at curbing inadvertent releases of methane from oil and gas operations on federal land as \u201cduplicative and unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cClean air and clean water are absolute top priorities when we talk about responsible energy development, however the final rule issued by the Obama administration does nothing to further protect our resources,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis rule is a stark reminder that we need to invest in infrastructure projects like the Keystone pipeline, so we don\u2019t need to flare excess gas.\u201d\n\n[Environmentalists and scientists brace for a future clash with Trump]\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Zinke has established a 3 percent voting score with the League of Conservation Voters. But he has broken ranks with the panel\u2019s GOP majority on occasion, opposing a measure by Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) that would have allowed each state to buy up to 2 million acres in U.S. Forest Service land to boost timber production. He has also pushed for full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a high priority for outdoors groups.\n\nLand Tawney, president and chief executive of the Montana-based Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, described Zinke on Tuesday as \u201ca straight shooter\u201d who has established credibility with outdoors enthusiasts in the state. During a recent meeting with him at a distillery in Whitefish, the congressman\u2019s home town, Zinke walked into the place in flip-flops.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019s a congressman,\u201d Tawney said. \u201cHe really prides himself on being a Theodore Roosevelt Republican, and he lives that a little bit more than other people.\u201d\n\n[Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump]\n\nOutdoors activities such as mountain biking and skiing are a major economic driver in Whitefish as well as in Montana overall, where roughly 200,000 residents have big-game hunting licenses and 300,000 have fishing licenses. Zinke, who has been endorsed by the Outdoor Industry Association, has embraced that sector of the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cHunting and fishing isn\u2019t something we do in Montana, it\u2019s a way of life,\u201d said Tawney, a fifth-generation Montanan.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership President Whit Fosburgh, whose hunters and anglers group has worked with Zinke, said in an interview that it would be \u201cvery supportive of Ryan Zinke\u201d as a Cabinet nominee.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shown courage and commitment to public lands and conservation and [is] someone we think would be an excellent secretary of interior,\u201d Fosburgh said.\n\n[Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings]\n\n1 of 34 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

Evan Vucci/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nStill, a slew of environmental groups came out Tuesday against Zinke, who opposes safeguards the Obama administration has provided for temporary wetlands and intermittent streams, as well as its temporary moratorium on coal leasing on federal land. While he supported subsidizing renewable energy programs and climate change legislation before being elected to the House, during a 2014 debate he said of climate change, \u201cIt\u2019s not a hoax, but it\u2019s not proven science either.\u201d\n\n\u201cZinke embodies the worst kind of magical thinking in Congress: that government welfare handouts can save dying coal companies and crumbling oil and gas giants,\u201d Greenpeace climate campaign specialist Diana Best said Tuesday. \u201cThe fact is, coal demand is shrinking globally, and people across America want a Department of the Interior that will protect our precious public lands in perpetuity. That means keeping them off-limits to fossil fuel production and recognizing that the world is moving forward.\u201d\n\nKier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the congressman\u2019s \u201cbrief political career has been substantially devoted to attacking endangered species and the Endangered Species Act,\u201d while the National Parks Conservation\u2019s president, Theresa Pierno, said he \u201chas repeatedly voted to block efforts to designate new national parks that would diversify the National Park System.\u201d\n\nWhile some Democrats are likely to oppose Zinke\u2019s nomination, the pick does provide the party with one bit of good news: It removes a possible challenger to Sen. Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat who likely will face a tough reelection bid in 2018.\n\nAlthough Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) was a leading contender to lead Interior in recent days, Zinke hit it off with Trump\u2019s oldest son, Don Jr., an avid hunter, and met personally with the president-elect on Monday in New York.\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday evening, McMorris Rodgers wrote, \u201cIt was an honor to be invited to spend time with the President-elect, and I\u2019m energized more than ever to continue leading in Congress as we think big, reimagine this government and put people back at the center of it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nRex Tillerson\u2019s view of climate change: It\u2019s just an \u2018engineering problem\u2019\n\nThe Arctic just had its warmest year on record \u2018by far,\u2019 scientists report\n\nEPA changes its stand on fracking, says it can harm drinking water in \u2018some circumstances\u2019", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-12-12/Getty/AFP_J260M.jpg", "title": "Trump taps Montana congressman Ryan Zinke as interior secretary", "summary": "[Trump taps former Texas governor Rick Perry to head Energy Department he once vowed to abolish]\u201cWhat I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,\u201d Zinke said at the time.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep.

The agency is responsible for nuclear weapons, nuclear power for the U.S. Navy, waste disposal, funding energy technology, overseeing federally-run labs and transmitting electricity.\n\nPerry\u2019s heading DOE could further anger Democrats, especially after a leaked transition team memo had numerous questions about the agency\u2019s work on global warming issues. That memo also inquired about ways DOE could keep aging nuclear reactors online.\n\nPerry has also been criticized for sitting on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, the company trying to build the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nThousands of activists battled it out with North Dakota police and pipeline security personnel for months before the Obama administration formally blocked the project. Trump expressed support for the pipeline, and will likely approve it upon taking office.\n\nTrump\u2019s also promised to cut the budget by eliminating wasteful programs. If that\u2019s the case, Perry may have a lot of work ahead of him at DOE.\n\nFor starters, DOE still has $40 billion left in the loan program that funded failed companies, like Solyndra and Abound Solar. The loan program is expected to lose more than $2 billion, according to government auditors.\n\nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

John McCain, R-Ariz., told CNN. \"We will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined. That\u2019s the time to make up your mind as to whether to vote yes or no.\u201d\n\nNews of Tillerson's emergence came as government officials accuse the Russian government of seeking to intervene in the recent U.S. election, including hacks of Democratic officials' e-mails \u2014 all in an effort to boost Trump's chances.\n\nPutin and Russia have denied the allegations, while Trump has questioned the idea of Russian interference.\n\nAnd with Trump promising to cancel the Paris climate agreement negotiated by President Obama, the nomination of an oil executive would send a powerful signal that the United States is prepared to buck the global consensus on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTrump's weeks-long search for secretary of State has included multiple interviews with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor and top adviser Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, and retired general and ex-CIA director David Petraeus.\n\nGiuliani, who said Friday he was withdrawing from the State Department competition, accompanied Trump to the Army-Navy game Saturday.\n\nAfter Trump aides said the list had been narrowed to those four, the president-elect decided to expand his list \u2014 a decision that brought his attention to Tillerson.\n\nTrump transition adviser Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Tillerson is a \"very intriguing pick to many people. He's already active in Russia, and China and Yemen and the developing world, across our globe. He has the kind of business experience that Donald Trump values.\"\n\nTillerson has worked for Exxon since graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1975, climbing the ranks until he was named CEO in 2006. He has no previous governmental or diplomatic experience.\n\nBut as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has negotiated with countries all over the world for oil exploration rights, particularly in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nOf particular interest in his Senate confirmation hearings would be the $2.2 billion Exxon investment in Russian oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean, which Tillerson negotiated in 2011. That agreement, which also allowed Russian investment in other Exxon ventures around the world, was eventually scuttled after U.S.-imposed sanctions following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\n\nAt Exxon, Tillerson has been critical of international sanctions, saying they\u2019re difficult to impose fairly. He has acknowledged that climate change has been caused by human activity, and has endorsed a carbon tax as \u201cthe most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions.\u201d\n\nBut environmental groups are expected to oppose his Senate confirmation if he's nominated. The New York Attorney General is investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to investors and consumers about the risks of climate change from burning fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cIn this position, Tillerson will try his hardest to silence global initiatives and the right of state attorney generals to hold fossil fuel companies legally accountable for climate change,\" said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA.\n\nThe secretary of State is also responsible for advancing U.S. policy on human rights. Tillerson, himself an Eagle Scout, was president of the Boy Scouts of America at the time when it began allowing gay scouts, and in 2015 ExxonMobil changed its anti-discrimination policy to include gays and lesbians. But the Human Rights Campaign remains skeptical of the company's policy, saying it was prompted by Obama's 2014 executive order targeting federal contractors, not a change in corporate values.\n\nGregory Korte reported from Washington.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2haHV2p", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bc64833864362c79c1d1599e7b4d964efa2c49c1/c=0-719-2621-2200&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/12/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636169764669470857-EPA-FILE-USA-GOVERNMENT-TRUMP-TRANSITION-87305792.JPG", "title": "Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson emerges as State Department frontrunner", "summary": "USA TODAYRex W.

The industry is infamous for grindingly low pay and labor law violations. Yet Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of the company that operates Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, has been chosen by President-elect Donald Trump as labor secretary.\n\nHere is the record at those restaurants. When the Obama Labor Department looked at thousands of complaints involving fast-food workers, it found labor law violations in 60 percent of the investigations at Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, usually for failure to pay the minimum wage or time and a half for overtime.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe central problem for workers today is persistently low pay, even at profitable companies with highly paid executives. Mr. Puzder, however, has been adamantly opposed to a meaningful increase in the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour. Mr. Trump has said he could stomach an increase to $10, which is still abysmal. Ideally, a labor secretary, who is supposed to have a deeper understanding of this issue, would push for much more. But Mr. Puzder has said that a big raise would mean fewer jobs for workers starting out. Even if that was true, and the evidence suggests otherwise, there are millions more who would benefit from raising the minimum wage.\n\nMr. Puzder has also been a scathing critic of efforts by the Obama administration to update the rules for overtime-pay eligibility, which have not been fully adjusted for inflation since the mid-1970s. His argument boils down to an assertion that employees prefer a low salary and the \u201cprestige\u201d of a managerial title \u2014 even though they would be entitled to overtime if they remained hourly employees. His opposition to the new overtime rules is especially troubling given that it would be his task as labor secretary to defend the rules, which have been challenged in court.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

John Kelly carved out a reputation as a highly respected, but often outspoken commander who could roil debate with blunt assessments or unpopular directives on issues ranging from women in combat to the treatment of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.\n\nBut the man chosen by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Homeland Security holds a more somber distinction. The battle-hardened veteran, who served three tours in Iraq, is the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nThat status, as part of what the military calls a Gold Star family, puts him in the Cabinet of a presidential candidate who verbally attacked a Gold Star family: the Khans, Muslim-American immigrants who lost a son in Iraq and had criticized Trump at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nKelly's son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in November 2010 in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump's choice, who joined the Marine Corps in 1970, retired this year, wrapping up a three-year post as head of U.S. Southern Command, which spanned some of the more fractious debate over the Obama administration's ultimately failed attempt to close Guantanamo.\n\nTransition officials confirmed Trump's pick of Kelly on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly before any official announcement.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Kelly would take over the nation's newest federal agency. The department was formed after the Sept. 11 terror attacks to get the U.S. government better-positioned to prevent and respond to incidents.\n\nGen. John Kelly Carolyn Kaster / AP President-elect Donald Trump talks to media as he stands with retired Marine Gen.

John Kelly, right, at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse on Nov. 20, 2016, in Bedminster, N.J.. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) (Carolyn Kaster / AP)\n\nKelly would be the fifth person to lead the department, which includes agencies that protect the president, respond to disasters, enforce immigration laws, protect the nation's coastlines and secure air travel.\n\nHis selection bolsters concerns about an increase in military influence in a Trump White House \u2014 and as Trump moves forward on his signature issue to build a wall along the southern border and go after people living in the country illegally.\n\nIn Kelly, Trump would have another four-star military officer for his administration. James Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, is Trump's pick for defense secretary.\n\nImmigration enforcement is a familiar issue for Kelly. Southern Command, based in South Florida, regularly works with DHS to dismantle immigrant smuggling networks. It has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an operation targeting human smuggling into the U.S. and helped with the rescue of children arriving alone at U.S. borders.\n\nIf Trump follows up on campaign promises to toughen immigration enforcement, the department will be charged with beefing up the screening of immigrants allowed to come into the U.S., and finding additional resources to track down and deport people living here illegally. It will also need to find a place to house these immigrants while they're awaiting deportation.\n\nDemocratic leader Nancy Pelosi said she hopes \"that Gen. Kelly is willing to stand up for facts, families and the Constitution.\"\n\n\"America will not be made great by dragging parents away from their children, by squandering billions of dollars on a wall that does little to secure the border, or by rejecting freedom of religion and echoing the darkest chapters of persecution,\" she said.\n\nScraping for federal funds and equipment to battle such problems will not be a new challenge for Kelly. At Southern Command, he was often blunt about his need for more resources to fight the drug trade.\n\nDuring a 2014 hearing, he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he didn't have the ships or surveillance assets to get more than 20 percent of the drugs leaving Colombia for the U.S.\n\nThe most contentious issue Kelly faced, though, was the push to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center, and proposals to bring detainees to a facility in the U.S. if they could not be sent to other nations. Lawmakers opposed closing Guantanamo, arguing it is the ideal location for terror suspects captured in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Pentagon faced criticism for not moving more quickly to release detainees to other countries. Those decisions largely rested with the defense secretary, but Kelly absorbed some of that anger even though his job was simply to carry out the transportation of the detainee after the decision was made. He also raised concerns about the costs of moving detainees to the U.S.\n\nWhile commander there, he also placed more limits on media access to Guantanamo and restricted information about hunger strikes. He believed prisoners were eating just enough to be considered hunger strikers without endangering their health in order to manipulate public opinion.\n\nIn his final Pentagon news conference, he spoke about the loss of his son \u2014 a topic he didn't often discuss publicly.\n\n\"To lose a child is \u2014 I can't imagine anything worse than that. I used to think, when I'd go to all of my trips up to Bethesda, Walter Reed, I'll go to the funerals with the secretaries of defense, that I could somehow imagine what it would be like,\" Kelly said.\n\nBut, he added, \"when you lose one in combat, there's a \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 there's a pride that goes with it, that he didn't have to be there doing what he was doing. He wanted to be there. He volunteered.\"\n\nKelly said he gets \"occasional letters from Gold Star families who are asking, 'Was it worth it?' And I always go back with this: It doesn't matter. That's not our question to ask as parents. That young person thought it was worth it, and that's the only opinion that counts.\"\n\nAssociated Press", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58484c43/turbine/ct-john-kelly-homeland-security-20161207", "title": "Trump picks retired Marine Gen.

Helderman explores the details behind the announcement that President-elect Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThat style, including his opaque personal financial dealings and his sudden shots at certain companies, has helped unnerve a corporate America that traditionally craves stability. Some business leaders and economists have worried whether executives can speak their minds about the president-elect or his policies without fear of facing Trump\u2019s rage.\n\n\u201cTwisting people\u2019s arms is inherently problematic\u201d for a president, said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe president has so much power, you always wonder if there\u2019s some implicit threat to individuals, and that goes beyond what I think a limited government should do,\u201d Mankiw said.\n\nBut some defended Trump\u2019s highly visible way of doing business in his transition to the Oval Office. Lanhee Chen, policy director of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, who is now at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, said he was not terribly concerned by Trump\u2019s interactions with individual corporations and chief executives.\n\n\u201cI just assume this is what generally happens,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is that unusual for a president to make appeals to specific companies. What may be unusual is the public nature of the communications. But the activity itself is not uncommon\u201d for presidents or for governors, he said.\n\nTaking on Boeing\n\nTrump has for months targeted companies that, like his own, have shipped jobs overseas. In a string of early-morning tweets Sunday, he threatened \u201cretribution or consequence\u201d for companies that move operations out of the country, as well as a 35 percent tariff on goods sold back to the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s Boeing slam Tuesday, though, was something new. The president-elect criticized the Chicago-based jet manufacturer, alleging that the costs of its federal contract to build a new Air Force One had, as Trump said, spiraled \u201cout of control.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced that a Japanese bank, Softbank, \"has agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States, and 50,000 jobs.\" Trump met with Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, at Trump Tower Tuesday. (Video: The Washington Post/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets came roughly an hour after the publication of a Chicago Tribune column citing Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg\u2019s suggestion that Trump and Congress \u201cback off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric.\u201d\n\nTrump spokesmen did not explain why he had targeted Boeing and did not provide other details. But they contributed to the confusion, by claiming Tuesday morning that Trump had in June sold a stock portfolio that by last year was worth up to $40 million.\n\nThe sale of Trump\u2019s shares in big banks, oil conglomerates and other companies with business before the government would have netted Trump millions of dollars during his costly presidential campaign. It also could help him tamp down worries over conflicts of interest between his private holdings and public job.\n\nOpaque finances\n\nBut beyond spokesman Jason Miller\u2019s comments Tuesday to The Washington Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since a financial-disclosure filing released in May.\n\nOver the past five months, Trump campaign officials gave no indication of the stock sale. Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings.\n\nAs president, Trump will be subject to the Stock Act, a 2012 law that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1,000 within 45 days.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Trump had taken a new turn, announcing that a Japanese telecommunications firm, SoftBank, had agreed to invest $50 billion in U.S. start-ups, a move he tweeted that the company would never have done \u201chad we [Trump] not won the election!\u201d\n\nThe president-elect made a brief showing in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower to announce the investment, smiling for the cameras and shaking hands with the firm\u2019s chief executive, Masayoshi Son.\n\nThe deal, however, is not new. The money will come from a $100 billion joint investment fund that Son established in October using money from partners, including Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned investment fund.\n\nSoftBank has invested in the United States in the past, including paying $22 billion in 2013 for a 80 percent share of Sprint. The firm also led a $1 billion investment round last year in San Francisco-based online lender Social Finance.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcements followed his assertion last week that he had saved 1,100 jobs in Indiana through a deal with air-conditioning company Carrier. The agreement, which includes $7 million in state incentives for the company, will actually keep 800 workers in the state, while 600 jobs will still go to Mexico.\n\nIn an interview Monday with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, the chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent company confirmed that it had made the deal in part out of fear.\n\n\u201cThere was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open,\u201d United Technologies chief executive Greg Hayes said. \u201cAt the same time . . . I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump concluded his public events at Carrier on Thursday night, he took on a second company that has announced it is moving jobs from Indiana to Mexico. \u201cRexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!\u201d he tweeted Friday.\n\nRexnord, which is based in Milwaukee, announced in June that it was closing an Indiana plant, resulting in the loss of 300 jobs.\n\nLong-run risk?\n\nKeith Hennessey, director of the National Economic Council under Bush, warned about the impact of Trump\u2019s approach to business and trade, which he said could do \u201clong-run economic harm to the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a politician rewards his business friends and punishes his business enemies it\u2019s called crony capitalism,\u201d Hennessey wrote in a blog on his personal website Monday.\n\n\u201cIt creates incentives for other business leaders to spend their time and money trying to get similar political access with elected officials,\u201d Hennessey added. \u201cAnd a firm leader now knows it can initiate a negotiation with the Trump Administration simply by threatening to outsource jobs.\u201d\n\nIn his blog, Hennessey urged Trump to stop \u201ctrying to tell individual American business leaders how to run their companies.\u201d He said his criticism was aimed at Trump\u2019s maneuvers involving Carrier, Rexnord and tariffs, but said he did not want to comment on Boeing.\n\nMankiw, the former Bush economic adviser, said that targeting individual companies runs contrary to \u201cequal protection of the law, which is a fundamental principle of fairness,\u201d violating founder John Adams\u2019s contention that the United States should be a nation of laws and not men.\n\nBeyond using the power of the presidency to intimidate in unpredictable and unfair ways, no individual could efficiently manage the economy, company by company, said Mankiw, who indicated before the election that he did not plan to vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen a chief exec is making individual calls to individual companies, he\u2019s in some sense acting like a central planner,\u201d Mankiw said. \u201cWe have a lot of history under communism that suggests it doesn\u2019t work well in practice, and that\u2019s the direction you\u2019re heading in as the president starts to weigh in on individual business decisions.\u201d\n\nTom Hamburger and Matea Gold contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/12/07/National-Economy/Images/Trump-23ef0.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019s unpredictable style unnerves corporate America", "summary": "Jan. 19, 2017 President-elect Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, visit the Lincoln Memorial before the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d concert.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, visit the Lincoln Memorial before the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d concert.\nHere\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the electionHere\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the electionThe turbulence began Tuesday morning with one of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s signature tweets of wrath: a public jab at Boeing alleging that the cost of building Air Force One had spiraled out of control.\nThe Post\u2019s Rosalind S.

Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016\n\nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new 747 planes, which would replace the current aging Reagan-era aircraft and go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape.\n\nThe contract for the planes was projected at about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. The Air Force had previously earmarked $1.65 billion for two new jets, but hadn\u2019t detailed costs beyond that. Boeing was the sole builder to bid on the planes, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThe plane is totally out of control,\u201d Trump told reporters later Tuesday inside Trump Tower. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Boeing downplayed any payments it\u2019s received, seemingly citing a January contract worth about $26 million and a July contract worth about $127 million as its only commitments on the Air Force One project.\n\n\u201cWe are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\u201d the aircraft giant said. \u201cWe look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\nTuesday was not Trump\u2019s first interaction with Boeing. Trump tweeted in January 2013 that he had bought stock in the corporation and called it a \u201cGreat company!\u201d Trump\u2019s personal aircraft, often called \u201cTrump Force One,\u201d is a Boeing 757.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal financial disclosure, filed in May, shows $50,000-$100,000 worth of stock in Boeing, though spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on a Tuesday conference call that Trump sold all of his stocks in June.\n\nMiller said the details of any cancellation would be handled once Trump was inaugurated but the Tuesday tweet \u201creally speaks to the president-elect\u2019s focus on keeping costs down across the board.\u201d\n\nTrump may have some precedent if he ultimately decides to nix the Boeing deal. President Obama in 2009 canceled the program to replace Marine One when the cost of the 28-helicopter fleet ballooned from $6.1 billion to $13 billion.\n\nTrump recently appointed ex-Boeing chairman, president and CEO Jim McNerney to chair a board of executive advisers on economic, regulatory and labor matters. McNerney retired as Boeing chair in March 2016.\n\nBut haggling over the bill may be about more than money.\n\nIn September, Boeing said China was set to buy $1 trillion worth of its planes during the next 20 years. China would become \u201cthe first trillion dollar aviation market\u201d after Boeing delivered nearly 7,000 planes, the company said in a statement at the time.\n\nTrump has been a frequent critic of China. The president-elect accepted a controversial call from the Taiwanese government last week, possibly jeopardizing longstanding U.S. policy towards China. On Sunday, he also tweeted extensively about companies that sought to leave the U.S., and singled out China for \u201cmaking it hard for our companies to compete.\u201d\n\nThe double-decker 747-8 is the only four-engine commercial jet made by Boeing, Reuters reported. It entered service in 1970 and underwent an overhaul in 2012.\n\nFox News' Doug McKelway and John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/12/06/0/0/694940094001_5237600735001_Trump-We-want-Boeing-to-make-money--but-not-that-much.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Trump rips Boeing for cost overruns on new Air Force One, says 'cancel order'", "summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it\u2019s ridiculous.\nThe Air Force had previously earmarked $1.65 billion for two new jets, but hadn\u2019t detailed costs beyond that.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.\n\"The president-elect took aim at Boeing's Air Force One work in a Tuesday morning tweet, and reiterated his concerns to reporters minutes later at Trump Tower.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump blasted Boeing on Tuesday for alleged cost overruns on a new fleet of Air Force One planes and called for the government to cancel the contract, saying the project price tag is \"out of control.", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["billion", "overruns", "president", "force", "trump", "worth", "contract", "air", "rips", "cost", "china", "planes", "cancel", "boeing", "order"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-05 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/5/13842258/pizzagate-comet-ping-pong-fake-news", "text": "On Sunday, a man walked into a pizzeria in Washington, DC, with an assault rifle and fired one or more shots.\n\nThe scene, thankfully, was not another example of a mass shooting \u2014 no one was injured or killed. Instead, it was the result of a fake news story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that proliferated on social media in the weeks before Election Day.\n\nThe totally false conspiracy theory claims that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chair, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring at the basement of a pizzeria in DC, Comet Ping Pong (which doesn\u2019t even have a basement). Over the past few weeks, Donald Trump supporters and white supremacists on social media have pushed the conspiracy theory \u2014 leading to headlines like \u201cPizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington\u2019s Occult Elite\u201d on fake news websites.\n\nThe Sunday shooting was far from the beginning of threats that Comet Ping Pong has faced over the past few weeks. Cecilia Kang reported at the New York Times that the restaurant\u2019s staff and its owner, James Alefantis, have faced a barrage of abuse and death threats on social media as a result of the conspiracy theory. Things have gotten so bad that the general manager\u2019s wife asked him to quit. Alefantis has worked to get the FBI and local police involved in an investigation to stop the conspiracy theory\u2019s spread, and requested that social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit take down messages and pictures related to the false conspiracy theory.\n\nBut it has persisted. Bryce Reh, Comet\u2019s general manager, characterized trying to take down the conspiracy theory online as \u201ctrying to shoot a swarm of bees with one gun.\u201d Yet as Pizzagate continues spreading online, it becomes more and more clear just how big of a problem fake news now poses \u2014 and how difficult it may be to address.\n\nPizzagate has been pushed by Trump supporters and white supremacists\n\nReally love that this #pizzagate infographic bothers to say \u201cit\u2019s not actually that crazy\" pic.twitter.com/AcZBC2SR0Q \u2014 Nick Wing (@nickpwing) December 5, 2016\n\nLike many ridiculous things on the internet, Pizzagate appears to have begun on the troll haven and message board 4chan. After Podesta\u2019s emails were hacked (likely by Russian agents) and WikiLeaks published them, 4chan users in October found emails between Podesta and Alefantis about a Clinton fundraiser that happened early in the campaign.\n\nFrom there, people began speculating without any evidence that the restaurant was part of a broader child trafficking ring run by the Democratic Party \u2014 a popular but entirely false conspiracy theory on the fringes of conservative media. The conspiracy theories jumped over to Reddit, where the popular Trump subreddit r/The_Donald championed it; Twitter, where pro-Trump tweeters (including the son of Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser) have continued to promote it; and Facebook, where fake news outlets have written and shared articles about it.\n\nAnd Alex Jones, the head of the fake news InfoWars who once argued that President Barack Obama and Clinton are literally demons, also boosted the conspiracy theory, saying on his show (in a video that was published in early November but later taken down) that \u201cHillary Clinton has personally murdered children.\u201d That video earned more than 420,000 videos before it was removed.\n\nHere is one example of a fake news outlet promoting the conspiracy theories behind Pizzagate, keeping in mind that the story is entirely false and the FBI has not confirmed anything about Pizzagate or related conspiracy theories because they\u2019re all wrong:\n\nCraig Silverman at BuzzFeed has an exhaustive report on how these ridiculous conspiracy theories got so big.\n\nThey appeared to really take off after a white supremacist Twitter account (which uses an avatar of a Jewish lawyer in New York) propped them up. The tweet pointed to a Facebook post that claimed a likely nonexistent \u201cNYPD source\u201d confirmed that police had found evidence on former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s devices that the Clinton campaign ran an international child enslavement ring. Again, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence for any of this \u2014 but the tweet, which is still up, quickly got thousands of retweets and favorites.\n\nRumors stirring in the NYPD that Huma's emails point to a pedophila ring and @HillaryClinton is at the center. #GoHillary #PodestaEmails23 pic.twitter.com/gkEH5oL269 \u2014 David Goldberg (@DavidGoldbergNY) October 30, 2016\n\nWith that, fake news outlets like Your News Wire pushed the story more broadly just days before Election Day. One of the stories even claimed, \u201cIT\u2019S OVER: NYPD Just Raided Hillary\u2019s Property! What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFE.\u201d New York police officers did not raid Clinton\u2019s property, but the story quickly got more than 100,000 engagements \u2014 shares, reactions, and comments \u2014 on Facebook, and it was quickly plagiarized by multiple fake news outlets to get hundreds of thousands more engagements on social media.\n\nThe nonsense just kept building and building, with fake news outlets running more and more false details about this false conspiracy theory \u2014 typically alleging that police, particularly the NYPD and FBI, had uncovered even more evidence of this international child abuse ring, even though no such thing had happened.\n\nAs all of this spread, pro-Trump supporters went back to the Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks to find more \u201cclues\u201d for Pizzagate and other conspiracy theories. Without any evidence or cause, they quickly began to interpret basic food items as code words for this supposed sex ring. Through this new ridiculous \u201cdiscovery,\u201d Trump supporters on social media linked even more emails to Pizzagate, which grew from a conspiracy theory about a DC pizzeria to one about a fictitious international child sex ring.\n\nSearch all Podesta emails for these keywords. We are uncovering a child sex ring.#PodestaEmails28 pic.twitter.com/h6N6O76sAw \u2014 Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) November 3, 2016\n\nBut communications between the Clinton campaign and Comet Ping Pong\u2019s Alefantis were the original source of the Pizzagate speculation. And the allegations were further emboldened by the pizzeria\u2019s ties to the Clinton campaign, including Alefantis\u2019s former relationship with David Brock, who founded the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters and publicly supported Clinton.\n\nSo the DC pizzeria bore the brunt of the damage that came from these widespread conspiracy theories. Starting the weekend before Election Day, the restaurant and its staff got hundreds of death threats on their phones and social media \u2014 including one that read, \u201cI will kill you personally.\u201d People also began showing up at Comet Ping Pong to investigate. Some people alleged Comet was working with nearby businesses to maintain the nonexistent child sex ring. Then, on Sunday, Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old from North Carolina, armed himself with an assault rifle and fired at least one shot in the restaurant while investigating the conspiracy theory.\n\nAfter the latest scare, Alefantis asked people on Sunday to stop spreading all this nonsense about his pizzeria: \u201cI really hope that all of these people fanning the flames of this conspiracy would take a moment to contemplate what has gone on here today and maybe to stop.\u201d\n\nWelch, for his part, told the New York Times that he now regrets what he did. \u201cI just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret how I handled the situation.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, this is about much more than one pizzeria and conspiracy theory.\n\nFake news has become a big problem on social media\n\nWhile Pizzagate has quickly become the most high-profile example of fake news going seriously wrong, it is part of a much broader problem with fake news that has quickly become widely recognized in the aftermath of the 2016 election.\n\nHere\u2019s one example of just how widespread fake news is: Over at BuzzFeed, Craig Silverman pit Facebook engagement for the top 20 fake news stories \u2014 like \u201cPope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president\u201d (he did not) and \u201cFBI agent suspected in Hillary email leaks found dead in apartment in murder-suicide\u201d (this did not happen) \u2014 against the top 20 legitimate news stories, from outlets like the New York Times and Huffington Post. In the last three months of the election, the fake news stories got more Facebook engagements than the legitimate news outlets.\n\nSo why did these outlets suddenly pop up and push fake news in time for the election? Some of it is political: Some people are willing to do anything they can, including lie, to make sure their candidate wins.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a financial interest in fake news. A BuzzFeed investigation found that many of the big fake news stories originated from a tiny Macedonian town known as Veles. There, young Macedonians have embraced \u201ca digital gold rush\u201d by setting up fake news sites and using Facebook as a platform to push their false stories, reaping the advertising dollars that come with the clicks and sharing.\n\nSilverman and Lawrence Alexander wrote for BuzzFeed, \u201cSeveral teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook \u2014 and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason these websites have a partisan, pro-Trump bent: At least in the 2016 election cycle, fake news took off much more with conservatives than with liberals. Laura Sydell reported at NPR the experience of one fake news purveyor, 40-year-old Jestin Coler in California:\n\nDuring the run-up to the presidential election, fake news really took off. \"It was just anybody with a blog can get on there and find a big, huge Facebook group of kind of rabid Trump supporters just waiting to eat up this red meat that they're about to get served,\" Coler says. \"It caused an explosion in the number of sites. I mean, my gosh, the number of just fake accounts on Facebook exploded during the Trump election.\" Coler says his writers have tried to write fake news for liberals \u2014 but they just never take the bait.\n\nWhy is this the case? Coler suggested that it has to do with Trump and conservative media outlets discrediting mainstream news, pushing conservatives to look for other outlets for their information: \u201cThis is a right-wing issue. Sarah Palin's famous blasting of the lamestream media is kind of record and testament to the rise of these kinds of people. The post-fact era is what I would refer to it as. This isn't something that started with Trump. This is something that's been in the works for a while. His whole campaign was this thing of discrediting mainstream media sources, which is one of those dog whistles to his supporters.\u201d\n\nWelch, the man who investigated Comet Ping Pong, echoed this kind of sentiment. Adam Goldman reported for the New York Times: \u201cHe said he did not like the term fake news, believing it was meant to diminish stories outside the mainstream media, which he does not completely trust.\u201d But Welch also claimed that he wasn\u2019t political: He said he didn\u2019t vote for Trump or Clinton, although he was once registered Republican.\n\nNot all fake news is geared toward conservatives. Jeremy Stahl at Slate pointed out that some liberals have seized on a few false stories, including those that hyped up Bernie Sanders\u2019s chances in the Democratic primary and blamed his loss on widespread voter suppression. But it does seem like the biggest fake news hits of the 2016 election were by and large geared for Trump supporters, with headlines like \u201cIT\u2019S OVER: Hillary\u2019s ISIS Email Just Leaked & It's Worse Than Anyone Could Have Imagined\u201d and \u201cJust Read the Law: Hillary Is Disqualified From Holding Any Federal Office\u201d dominating the most shared fake news stories of the last three months of the election.\n\nWherever it lands on the political spectrum, all of this fake news has created a big problem: Many people are now getting completely false information from fake news outlets that pose as legitimate, making it hard for readers to know if the information is legitimate.\n\nSo the rapid spread of fake news has led people to demand that social media platforms, particularly Facebook, and Google do something to halt the spread of fake news.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have promised some action to counter fake news\n\nGoogle responded in November, announcing that it was cutting off fake news sites from its huge advertising network. Facebook followed suit by vowing to block fake news outlets within its own ad network.\n\nStill, Facebook has at times been resistant to do much more \u2014 like making sure that fake news doesn\u2019t pop up in someone\u2019s Facebook feed in the first place. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, suggested that fake news wasn\u2019t much of an issue to begin with, writing in a Facebook post (without evidence for his numbers) that \u201cmore than 99% of what people see [on Facebook] is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\u201d\n\nBut Facebook now seems to be acknowledging that it needs to do something.\n\n\u201cFor so long, we had resisted having standards about whether something\u2019s newsworthy because we did not consider ourselves a service that was predominantly for the distribution of news. And that was wrong,\u201d Facebook executive Elliot Schrage said at a panel in Massachusetts last week. \u201cWe have a responsibility here. I think we recognize that. This has been a learning for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility here. I think we recognize that. This has been a learning for us.\u201d\n\nThe bad news: Facebook doesn\u2019t seem to have an idea about what it will do yet. The big problem seems to be that the social media platform just doesn\u2019t want to get into heavily policing people\u2019s own posts and feeds, especially in a way that could come off as partisan or as censorship.\n\nBut Facebook is also now the main way many Americans and people around the world share and read the news. That has led to a democratization of media, which means that new legitimate news sites like Vox can build a big audience and even compete with established outlets like the New York Times, but also that a fake news site can as well.\n\nAs Tim Lee explained for Vox, \u201cStories like this thrive on Facebook because Facebook\u2019s algorithm prioritizes \u2018engagement\u2019 \u2014 and a reliable way to get readers to engage is by making up outrageous nonsense about politicians they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nSo the platform needs to take some more responsibility for what it\u2019s doing.\n\nUltimately, Facebook seems to be coming around to some sort of system that would nudge users to act differently without actively blacklisting or favoring certain sites. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business of giving users the power to share. Part of that is helping them share thoughtfully and responsibly, and consume thoughtfully and responsibly,\u201d Schrage said, offering few details for how exactly this would work.\n\nWhatever Facebook and others do, some of it will come too late. Not only did fake news appear to convince a gunman to fire off bullets at a DC pizzeria, but the rise of fake news prior to Election Day suggests it may have helped Trump get elected.\n\nWatch: It\u2019s now on America\u2019s institutions \u2014 and Republicans \u2014 to check Donald Trump", "image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9DgTBWUC_eyhHV2oLOfDEeEQgA=/0x21:3000x1688/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52144973/627823978.0.jpeg", "title": "Pizzagate, the fake news conspiracy theory that led a gunman to DC\u2019s Comet Ping Pong, explained", "summary": "Laura Sydell reported at NPR the experience of one fake news purveyor, 40-year-old Jestin Coler in California:During the run-up to the presidential election, fake news really took off.\nThe totally false conspiracy theory claims that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chair, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring at the basement of a pizzeria in DC, Comet Ping Pong (which doesn\u2019t even have a basement).\nI mean, my gosh, the number of just fake accounts on Facebook exploded during the Trump election.\nSo the rapid spread of fake news has led people to demand that social media platforms, particularly Facebook, and Google do something to halt the spread of fake news.\nThe Sunday shooting was far from the beginning of threats that Comet Ping Pong has faced over the past few weeks.", "source": "Vox.com", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["German Lopez", "Dec Est"], "keywords": ["facebook", "pizzagate", "led", "theory", "media", "social", "explained", "ping", "outlets", "conspiracy", "gunman", "election", "fake", "false", "pong", "dcs", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-12-05 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/ben-carson-hud-secretary-nomination/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Ben Carson will be nominated as the next secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Trump transition team announced Monday.\n\n\"I am thrilled to nominate Dr. Ben Carson as our next Secretary of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development,\" President-elect Donald Trump said in a statement. \"Ben Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities.\"\n\nDuring their primary fight, though, Trump had derided Carson as \"super low energy\" and delivered a number of sharp attacks on Twitter, questioning Carson's temperament and qualifications for office.\n\nWith Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?\n\n\"With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?\" Trump tweeted in November of 2015, when he and Carson were still rivals.

Elijah Cummings, the Democratic ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, slammed the pick, calling Carson \"woefully unqualified.\"\n\n\"[Trump] has no selected someone woefully unqualififed to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. During his time in Baltimore, Dr. Ben Carson was a phenomenal neurosurgeon, but he has no experience developing housing policy affecting tens of millions of households or running a complex federal agency, as his own spokesman admitted just last month,\" the Maryland representative said in a statement.\n\nCummings was referencing reports that Carson rejected a previous offer from Trump to be the next secretary of Health and Human services because he felt he was too inexperienced to run a federal agency, according to longtime aide Armstrong Williams. Responding to those reports, Williams had said, \"He's never run an agency and it's a lot to ask. He's a neophyte and that's not his strength.\"\n\nCarson's unsuccessful primary campaign was punctuated by rookie blunders and odd claims, including that the Egyptian pyramids were used to store grain. \"The pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments,\" he said. \"You wouldn't need hermetically sealed compartments for a sepulcher. You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.\"\n\nHe is known for offering provocative commentary on a wide range of issues, including comparing the modern American government to Nazi Germany in a March 2014 interview with Breitbart, and saying at the Voter Values Summit in 2013 that Obamacare is \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"\n\nCarson endorsed Trump shortly after he dropped out of the contest, becoming only the second former Republican candidate to do so after Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nThe secretary of housing and urban development oversees federal public housing programs and helps formulate policy on homelessness and housing discrimination. As is the case with all cabinet secretaries, Carson needs to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nCarson had signaled he would be named to the job Wednesday afternoon, posting on Facebook that an announcement about his forthcoming role in the administration.\n\n\"After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\" Carson wrote. \"We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid.\"\n\nTrump praised Carson as a \"greatly talented person\" in a tweet two weeks ago when he said he was considering Carson for the HUD position.\n\n\"I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well -- he's a greatly talented person who loves people!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nI am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016\n\nTrump promised during his campaign to prioritize the restoration of America's inner cities, though he frequently courted controversy by using exaggerated rhetoric that painted a bleak portrait of minority communities\n\n\"The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We're going to work with the African-American community and we're going to solve the problem of the inner city,\" Trump said at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, in October. \"We're going to bring safety back. You can't walk out the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. So we're going to work very strongly with the African American community.\"\n\nCarson was one of the large field of Republican presidential candidates. He enjoyed an early surge in the polls after he announced his campaign in May 2015 and ran mostly on his biography rather than policy. He bowed out of the race after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday.\n\nCarson admits that he had a violent temper in his youth, and says one of the defining moments of his life occurred when he was 14. Carson said he tried to stab a schoolmate, but the boy's belt buckle blocked the knife.

Hakim, or Keith X. Ellison, or Keith Muhammad, etc.) is campaigning for office. Not for the safe House seat he holds, but for the leadership of the Democratic party, a job until recently held by the hilariously incompetent and boundlessly vapid Debbie Wasserman Schultz (who was forced to resign \u2014 \u201cresign\u201d here meaning \u201ctransfer formally to the Clinton campaign\u201d \u2014 when she was exposed conniving to stack the presidential primary elections against Senator Bernie Sanders (S., Portlandia)), who was temporarily replaced by Donna Brazile, who was exposed leaking debate questions to the Clinton campaign, a violation of trust for which she remains adamantly impenitent.\n\nRepublicans should take a minute to simply enjoy all this before getting on to the serious business at hand. If they cannot have Debbie Wasserman Schultz organizing opposition to them, former Farrakhan fanboy Keith Ellison of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party is a great second choice.\n\nEllison is the first Muslim elected to the House, and he complains that the recent spate of criticism directed at him is rooted in \u2014 ridiculous word \u2014 Islamophobia. But there is a bit more to it than that.\n\nEllison has long been a vocal defender of the so-called Nation of Islam, the bow-tie gang founded by Elijah Muhammad whose relationship to orthodox Islam is approximately that of a UFO cult to the Anglican communion. The NOI and its charismatic leader, the former calypso musician Louis Farrakhan, is an explicitly racist organization, holding as a matter of doctrine that the white race is the result of a doomed mad-science experiment conducted by the biblical Jacob while he was living on the isle of Patmos. Farrakhan is a true religious entrepreneur who has attempted to graft L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s fanciful \u201cDianetics\u201d onto his own cracked version of Islam, but he has mostly relied on a very old and reliable tradition: Jew-hating.\n\nFarrakhan\u2019s history of vicious anti-Semitism was already well established when Ellison was helping him organize the Million Man March. The Democratic representative says that he rejects anti-Semitism, but he has a long history of sticking up for Jew-hating weirdos, and not only Farrakhan. When Kwame Ture \u2014 you may remember him as Stokely Carmichael \u2014 claimed that Jews had collaborated with the Nazis in the Holocaust as a pretext for establishing the state of Israel, Ellison was there to defend him from criticism. When the head of a Minneapolis political group declared that the allegations of anti-Semitism against Farrakhan were made up and insisted that the real problem is racist Jews, Ellison said: \u201cShe is correct.\u201d He is a defender of the terrorist Sara Jane Olson and the murderer Assata Shakur and the Islamic terrorist Sami al-Arian. He is a longtime admirer of the murderous dictator Fidel Castro.\n\nEllison has said that he has since \u201crejected\u201d the Nation of Islam and its anti-Semitism, and that his involvement with Farrakhan was simply an exercise in community organizing, i.e. the usual liberals-in-a-hurry bull. Ellison is invoking the unwritten Robert Byrd Rule: Democrats get a pass on associating with crackpot racist cults if they vote the right way on the minimum wage.\n\nIf he has outgrown Farrakhan, then hurray for him. More joy in Heaven and all that. Ellison\u2019s real problem may not be his association with Louis Farrakhan\u2019s unorthodox Islam but with the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s very orthodox version.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928 by the Egyptian scholar Hassan al-Banna, is a Sunni-supremacist organization operating under the motto: \u201cAllah is our objective; the Qur\u2019an is the Constitution; the Prophet is our leader; jihad is our way; death for the sake of Allah is our wish.\u201d It is linked at various levels of intimacy to Hamas \u2014 which is an immediate offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 along with sundry Sunni extremist groups, one or two degrees of separation removed from al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda, and the like. But its reach is sprawling, and it also is closely linked with such purportedly respectable Islamic organizations as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which our Andrew C. McCarthy rightly describes as \u201ca Muslim Brotherhood creation conceived to be a Western-media-savvy shill for Islamic supremacism in general and Hamas in particular.\u201d\n\nThe question is not whether a U.S. political party should be led by a Muslim man, but by this Muslim man.\n\nEllison has spoken at the convention of the Islamic Society of North America, which is part of the CAIR-Hamas network, at least according to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that \u201cthe government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR, ISNA, NAIT, with the Islamic Association for Palestine, and with Hamas\u201d during the Holy Land Foundation case. These links have been discussed in these pages at great length by McCarthy and by our colleague Daniel Pipes, among others. Ellison went on a pilgrimage to Mecca sponsored by the Muslim American Society, which is simply the Muslim Brotherhood under another name. In Mecca, he met with Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah, an officer of a Muslim Brotherhood group that issued a fatwa against U.S. troops in Iraq and supports Palestinian terrorists in Israel. He met with terror-linked Saudi financiers and other unsavory characters, too.\n\nThe question is not whether a U.S. political party should be led by a Muslim man, but by this Muslim man. We are not talking about Nam\u0131k Kemal or Robert Crane.\n\nKeith Ellison is one representative. In the short term, the focus will be on the man \u2014 but in the long term, it will be on the movement.\n\nSpecifically, Congress has considered, and may revive, legislation supported by Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) that would designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, as the Egyptians and the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council insist it is. The case is not too terribly difficult to make, and the main defense of the Muslim Brotherhood offered by critics such as Marc Lynch is that the organization is not what it used to be, that it is no longer the same group that founded Hamas and cultivated generations of Islamic radicals but is instead broken, scattered, and less significant. Perhaps it is so, but if it is so, this is precisely the sort of organization that you want to kick while it is down.\n\nThe real problem is that the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s fingers are in practically every Islamic pie in the United States and much of the rest of the world, and turning over that rock almost certainly will expose any number of queasy reminders that the distance between the Islamic mainstream and Islamic extremism is not so great as we sometimes imagine. A great many media-friendly Muslims and so-called moderates will be put in a very difficult position \u2014 and we should welcome that. We have for too long made it too easy for the so-called respectable Islamist organizations in the West to play both sides of the fence.\n\nRepublicans should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, based simply on the weight of the evidence. But if they\u2019re feeling a little bit mean \u2014 and why not? \u2014 they should wait until the Democrats have put Keith Ellison in charge of their party to do it.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.

On Thursday, the White House urged Mr. Trump to use experts from the State Department to prepare him for these exchanges.\n\nThe White House was not told about Mr. Trump\u2019s call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe longer-term fallout from the Trump-Tsai conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a well-established arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has adamantly opposed the attempts of any country to carry on official relations with it.\n\nOn Nov. 14, Mr. Trump spoke with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, and a statement from the transition team said the two men had a \u201cclear sense of mutual respect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInitial reaction from China about Friday\u2019s telephone call was surprise verging on disbelief. \u201cThis is a big event, the first challenge the president-elect has made to China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThis must be bad news for the Chinese leadership.\u201d\n\nOfficial state-run media have portrayed Mr. Trump in a positive light, casting him as a businessman China could get along with. He was favored among Chinese commentators during the election over Hillary Clinton, who was perceived as being too hard on China.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s exchange touched \u201cthe most sensitive spot\u201d for China\u2019s foreign policy, Mr. Shi said. The government, he said, would most likely interpret it as encouraging Ms. Tsai, the leader of the party that favors independence from the mainland, to continue to resist pressure from Beijing.\n\nAmong diplomats in the United States, there was similar shock. \u201cThis is a change of historic proportions,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior director of Asian affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cThe real question is, what are the Chinese going to do?\u201d\n\nIn a second Twitter message about the call Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \u201cInteresting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\u201d\n\nTies between the United States and Taiwan are currently managed through quasi-official institutions. The American Institute in Taiwan issues visas and provides other basic consular services, and Taiwan has an equivalent institution with offices in several cities in the United States.\n\nThese arrangements are the outgrowth of the One China policy that has governed relations between the United States and China since President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s historic meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of China, abrogating its ties with Taipei a year later.\n\nThe call also raised questions of conflicts of interest.\n\nNewspapers in Taiwan reported last month that a Trump Organization representative had visited the country, expressing interest in perhaps developing a hotel project adjacent to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which is undergoing a major expansion. The mayor of Taoyuan, Cheng Wen-tsan, was quoted as confirming that visit.\n\nBreaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, Amanda Miller, said that the company had \u201cno plans for expansion into Taiwan,\u201d and that there had been no \u201cauthorized visits\u201d to the country to push a Trump development project. But Ms. Miller did not dispute that Anne-Marie Donoghue, a sales manager overseeing Asia for Trump Hotels, had visited Taiwan in October, a trip that Ms. Donoghue recorded on her Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call with the Taiwanese president came just as President Obama delivered a more subtle, but also aggressive, rebuff of China: He blocked, by executive order, an effort by Chinese investors to buy a semiconductor production firm called Aixtron.\n\nMr. Obama took the action on national security grounds, after an intelligence review concluded that the technology could be used for \u201cmilitary applications\u201d and help provide an \u201coverall technical body of knowledge and experience\u201d to the Chinese.\n\nThe decision is likely to accelerate tension with Beijing, as Chinese authorities make it extraordinarily difficult for American technology companies, including Google and Facebook, to gain access to the Chinese market, and Washington seeks to slow China\u2019s acquisition of critical technology.\n\nMr. Trump has made little effort to avoid antagonizing China. He has characterized climate change as a \u201cChinese hoax,\u201d designed to undermine the American economy. He has said China\u2019s manipulation of its currency deepened a trade deficit with the United States. And he has threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, a proposal that critics said would set off a trade war.\n\nBy happenstance, just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai, Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who designed the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, was in Beijing meeting with Mr. Xi. It was unclear if Mr. Kissinger, 93, was carrying any message from Mr. Trump, with whom he met again recently in his role as the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy sage.\n\n\u201cThe presidential election has taken place in the United States and we are now in the key moment. We, on the Chinese side, are watching the situation very closely. Now it is in the transition period,\u201d Mr. Xi told Mr. Kissinger in front of reporters.\n\nA small, hard-line faction of Republicans has periodically urged a more confrontational approach to Beijing, and many of President George W. Bush\u2019s advisers were pressing such an approach in the first months of his presidency in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11 defused that move, and Iraq became the No. 1 enemy. After that, Mr. Bush needed China \u2014 for North Korea diplomacy, counterterrorism and as an economic partner \u2014 and any movement toward confrontation was quashed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump has shown little concern about ruffling feathers in his exchanges with leaders. He also spoke on Friday with the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who has called Mr. Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and been accused of ordering the extrajudicial killings of thousands of suspected drug dealers. On Saturday, Mr. Duterte said that Mr. Trump had wished him well in his antidrug campaign, though his account could not immediately be verified.\n\nThis week, Mr. Trump appeared to accept an invitation from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit Pakistan, a country that Mr. Obama has steered clear of, largely over tensions between Washington and Islamabad over counterterrorism policy and nuclear proliferation.\n\nLawmakers expressed alarm at the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling approach.\u201cWhat has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift.

James Mattis to be his secretary of defense, tapping yet another outspoken ex-military leader who butted heads with the Obama administration to shape and carry out his national security strategy.\n\nIf confirmed, the highly decorated battlefield commander would be only the second retired general to become defense secretary \u2014 and would require a special waiver from Congress in the form of separate legislation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI will not tell you that one of our great, great generals \u2014 don\u2019t let it outside of this room,\u201d Trump teased a rally in Cincinnati Thursday night, playing up the drama. \u201cWe are going to appoint 'Mad Dog' Mattis as our secretary of defense \u2026 but we are not announcing it until Monday, so don\u2019t tell anyone. He\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\"They say he\u2019s the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have and it\u2019s about time,\" he added, referring to the impolitic and aggressive battlefield commander in World War II. \"It\u2019s about time.\u201d\n\nHours earlier, Trump's transition team had denied that he had settled on a defense secretary despite a report in The Washington Post that Mattis was the choice. \"No decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense,\" spokesman Jason Miller tweeted at 4:40 p.m.\n\nMattis, 66, so nicknamed for his salty language and obsessive dedication to the military, was the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013. He had earlier co-authored a counterinsurgency strategy manual credited with helping to halt some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq before the U.S. military withdrawal in December 2011.\n\nBut as head of the U.S. Central Command he also clashed with President Barack Obama's National Security Council, particularly over Iran, which Mattis has called \u201cthe single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.\"\n\nIt's a view that aligns more closely with Trump and his pick for White House national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom the Obama administration had removed as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Both Trump and Flynn have advocated pulling out of an agreement reached with Iran last year to curtail its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions and eventually removing the arms embargo.\n\nYet not all of Mattis' views are so in sync with Trump and Flynn, who have made friendly gestures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mattis has expressed deep wariness of Russia's intentions, saying it wants \u201cto break NATO apart.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign Mattis did not hold back in criticizing Trump and some of his rhetoric, including the president-elect's comments that NATO was obsolete and that its members don't pay their fair share.\n\n\u201cSome of those allies have lost more troops per capita in Afghanistan than we have,\u2019\u2019 Mattis, who also served as NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander for transformation, told POLITICO in July. \u201cSome of them are spending 20 percent of their national budget on defense.\u201d\n\nView Trump announces his pick for General 'Mad Dog' Mattis as defense secretary At a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he picked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to be his secretary of defense.\n\nOn Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslim immigrants, Mattis said that such talk prompts U.S. allies to think \u201cwe have lost faith in reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think we\u2019ve completely lost it,\" he said. \"This kind of thing is causing us great damage right now, and it\u2019s sending shock waves through this international system.\"\n\nThe general has also espoused some views that break with the majority of his fellow military leaders. He has expressed reservations about allowing women to serve in combat, telling the Marines' Memorial Club in San Francisco that \"the idea of putting women in there is not setting them up for success.\" He has also questioned whether the U.S. nuclear arsenal needs to consist of submarines, bombers and land-based missiles. \"Is it time to reduce the Triad to a Diad, removing the land\u2010based missiles?\" he asked the Senate Armed Services Committee last year.\n\nThe pick was swiftly lauded by the GOP national security establishment.\n\n\"He brings a clear-eyed view to the potential adversaries our nation faces, including Russia,\" Tom Spoehr, director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in a statement, calling the general \"an outstanding selection for this critically important position.\"\n\nMattis has key backers on Capitol Hill, including Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, which would lead the confirmation process.\n\n\"General Mattis is one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops,\" McCain said in a recent statement. \"He is a forthright strategic thinker. His integrity is unshakable and unquestionable. And he has earned his knowledge and experience the old-fashioned way: in the crucible of our nation's defense and the service of heroes.\n\n\u201cGeneral Mattis has a clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense, the U.S. military and our national security,\" McCain added.\n\nSince retiring from the Marine Corps, Mattis has served on the board of defense giant General Dynamics, as well as Theranos, a Silicon Valley biotech company that came under scrutiny for its business practices \u2014 and which Mattis reportedly advocated on behalf of before the military despite agreeing not to.\n\nHe's also a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and has done some private consulting.\n\nMattis' elevation to Trump's Cabinet would make him a first among equals.\n\nApart from the president, only the defense secretary has the legal authority to order the military into action. And while the decision to launch a nuclear attack rests solely with the commander-in-chief, the procedures require secondary confirmation from the defense secretary, though he does not get a veto.\n\nView Photo gallery Politicians, moguls and even a few Democrats: Trump's revolving door of post-election visitors Political observers have closely watched Donald Trump\u2019s every move as he goes about the massive task of filling the thousands of political appointee jobs, with acute interest in the makeup of his Cabinet. Hundreds of people have called on Trump\u2019s Manhattan office, rural New Jersey getaway and Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the past two months; here\u2019s a day-by-day look at some of the people who have visited since Trump was elected.\n\nBut to get the job Mattis will need something highly unusual: a waiver. As a result, his selection is viewed by some as a major departure from tradition.\n\nMattis is technically ineligible to be Defense secretary because the law requires retired military officers to be out of uniform for seven years before they can become the military's civilian leader. That's in an effort to ensure that civilian control of the armed forces, a bedrock of the American democratic tradition, remains inviolate.\n\nUnless Congress votes and the president signs an exception, \"a person may not be appointed as secretary of defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force,\" the law says.\n\n\"It happened once,\" Harold Brown, who was defense secretary under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981, told POLITICO. \"And that was George Marshall,\" the Army's legendary chief of staff in World War II, who went to become both secretary of State and secretary of defense under President Harry Truman. \"Congress had to pass a separate law exempting him.\"\n\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton picked retired Adm. Bobby Inman to be Defense secretary, but he had been off of active duty for the required period and his nomination was ultimately withdrawn anyway.\n\nWhen Congress passed a waiver for Marshall in 1950, it made clear it did not want to set a precedent.\n\n\"It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authority granted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of Defense in the future,\" its report accompanying the legislation said. \"It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of secretary of defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.\"\n\nRetired Marine Gen. James Mattis was the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013. | AP Photo\n\n\"The Congress' report at the time said it is very unusual,\" Brown said, \"and should probably never happen again. This is a significant barrier, though it is not an insuperable one. The Trump administration would have to make a very compelling case. Mattis doesn't have the standing of George Marshall. They'd have to make the case he is another George Marshall.\"\n\nSome Republicans think he may be.\n\nEarlier this year, a bloc of GOP hawks who opposed Trump's candidacy tried to persuade Mattis to run for president as a third-party candidate, though he expressed no interest.\n\nCongressional aides say work is already underway to determine the legislative language needed to grant Mattis a waiver.\n\nArnold Punaro, a former staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who helped craft the current statute, said that while Mattis' waiver would need to be approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, he does not see it as a major problem.\n\n\"He would not in any way undermine or erode civilian control of the military, and it would be hard to find someone who would be less likely to be pushed around by the military and he is now a civilian and would be firmly in charge,\" said Punaro, calling Mattis a \"stellar choice.\"\n\nOne of Mattis' fellow retired generals also doesn't anticipate it will pose much of a roadblock.\n\n\"Waivers are waivers,\" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Mick Bednarek, who until last year was the top U.S. military adviser in Iraq. \"In the case of Jim Mattis, that would not be too contentious. The real issue is his views and perspectives.\"\n\nBut the waiver is going to meet some resistance.\n\n\u201cWhile I deeply respect General Mattis\u2019s service, I will oppose a waiver,\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee,\u201d said in a statement Thursday night. \u201cCivilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.\u201d\n\nOthers demanded that his views on torture and other human rights concerns be key to the Senate confirmation process.\n\n\u201cWe have real concerns about human rights in a Trump Administration, and we will demand that the Senate press General Mattis about his specific views and positions,\u201d Naureen Shah, director of Amnesty International USA\u2019s security with human rights program, said in a statement.\n\nMattis is known as one of the most blunt battlefield commanders of his generation. He is mostly revered \u2014 but also reviled by some \u2014 for his rough edges and controversial comments, traits that have gotten him into hot water.\n\n\u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap around women for five years because they didn\u2019t wear a veil,\u201d he said in in 2005. \u201cYou know guys like that ain\u2019t got no manhood left anyway, so it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\u201d\n\nAlso in his rhetorical repertoire: \u201cThe first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some a------- in the world that just need to be shot.\u201d\n\nBut despite his candor, Mattis is also considered a \u201cwarrior monk\" for the library of books he carried from post to post, ranging from Roman philosophy to Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War.\"\n\n\u201cYou are part of the world\u2019s most feared and trusted force,\" he once told forces under his command. \"Engage your brain before you engage your weapon.\u201d\n\nMattis, who is unmarried, was also known as the rare commander who could be found visiting his troops in their fighting positions, or volunteering to be the watch officer on Christmas so one of his underlings could be with his family.\n\n\"His dedication is unparalleled. He is married to the the nation,\" Bednarek told POLITICO. \"He has a 100 percent focus on mission accomplishment. His forte is his leadership and his thoughtfulness.\"\n\nRetired Adm. William Fallon, who was Mattis' boss early in the Iraq War, said he believes Mattis may be just the right person to run the Pentagon.\n\nWhile he has vast experience in war, he has also been outspoken in recent years about the need for clearer goals and policies to guide it.\n\n\"The most important thing is that Jim's got a really good understanding that you need to have a good policy framework before digging foxholes,\" Fallon told POLITICO. \"He has been urging leadership to focus on coming up with policies before sending troops into action.\"\n\n\"That is what is really needed right now,\" Fallon added.\n\nEli Stokols, Austin Wright and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.", "image": "http://static.politico.com/ac/ba/4887e5b94d5b9d5bd3af6a846543/161201-trump-mattis-ap-1160.jpg", "title": "Trump picks General 'Mad Dog' Mattis as defense secretary", "summary": "\u201cSome of them are spending 20 percent of their national budget on defense.\u201dView Trump announces his pick for General 'Mad Dog' Mattis as defense secretary At a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he picked retired Marine Gen.

Fair enough.\n\n\n\nThen there was relatively positive feedback for Trump\u2019s naming of teacher\u2019s union busting school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. Some conservatives weren\u2019t overly enthused about Trump\u2019s selection of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for U.N. Ambassador because of her tepid support for the Republican ticket during the campaign, but no one loudly objected.\n\n\n\nAnd all the rumors circulating around Mitt Romney and the Secretary of State\u2019s post\u2026well, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ll wait until someone is named before the universe explodes on that one.\n\n\n\nBut Trump\u2019s latest picks for the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury are leaving many conservatives aghast. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s team announced they\u2019d decided on Wilbur Ross for the Commerce job and Steven Mnuchin to lead the Treasury department.\n\n\n\nIn reaction, Erick Erickson wrote at The Resurgent, \u201cWilbur Ross is a Democrat. He worked with Bill Clinton. He has funded Democrats. He has been on the New York Democratic Committee. He is a Democrat filled with Democrat ideas. And Trump wants him to be Secretary of Commerce.\n\n\n\n\u201cSteven Mnuchin is a George Soros loving leftist who forced poor people into foreclosures that were unnecessary. He is as insider as you can get on Wall Street.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot quite content to stop there, Erickson continued, \u201cAs much as Tom Price is a friend and good man, he has also been in Congress since 2002 and Elaine Chao, as much as she is a nightmare to union activists, is Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife and a career cabinet member.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrice and Chao were named to Trump\u2019s cabinet on Tuesday. Erickson\u2019s reaction was typical of what I read about them, though there were a number of principled conservatives (such as FRC\u2019s Tony Perkins) who praised Price especially.\n\n\n\nErickson\u2019s basic beef is that with Trump\u2019s latest moves, the \u201cswamp\u201d isn\u2019t being drained, which is by implication a slap at the president-elect himself since it appears as though Trump\u2019s breaking his campaign promise to completely scrub and sanitize the bilges of Washington. All throughout his presidential run Trump swore that Washington was going to be a changed place if he were elected\u2026and at least by appearance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be happening.\n\n\n\nErickson makes a reasonable point, though as one of the leading and enduring members of #NeverTrump it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s actually offering constructive criticism or whether he\u2019s just trying to add emphasis to yet another claim of \u201cSee, I told you Trump would be awful!\u201d\n\n\n\nI think in the case of Trump\u2019s cabinet, some perspective is in order. First, by naming people he views as the best person for each job, Trump is in essence keeping a campaign promise rather than breaking one.\n\n\n\nMany times during debates Trump talked about bringing people into government who know business and can sit across the table from world leaders and not be taken advantage of. If, in fact, Ross and Mnuchin truly are \u201cswamp creatures\u201d, at least they\u2019ll know as much about the environment of the \u201cbog\u201d as the people they\u2019re conversing with.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not true when it comes to most politicians who\u2019ve spent their entire careers swimming next to lobbyists in the malodorous oozing quagmire that is Washington.\n\n\n\nNext, though on the surface men like Ross and Mnuchin would appear to be the same types of \u201cswamp creatures\u201d that Trump swore he would cast out of his administration, they both come from successful professional backgrounds.\n\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, \u201cWilbur Louis Ross, Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor, and former banker, known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. As of August 2014, Forbes magazine lists Ross as one of the world's billionaires with a net worth of $2.9 billion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso according to Wikipedia, \u201cSteven Terner Mnuchin (born December 21, 1962) is an American banker, film producer, and political fundraiser. He is a former partner for Goldman Sachs for 17 years where he accrued a net worth estimated at about $40 million. He then founded the motion picture firm, RatPac-Dune Entertainment.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also served as finance chair for Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\nMnuchin and Ross have never been officeholders, just like Trump. Many of the criticisms being leveled at them are nearly identical to #NeverTrump\u2019s contentions against Trump himself during the campaign. True, Trump claimed for years to be a Democrat and we all know he championed just about every Democrat cause under the sun for much of his life.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s public lifestyle was also much more conducive to the \u201canything goes\u201d mentality of the Democrats. Why do you think he fit in so well for so long with the New York and Hollywood elite?\n\n\n\nIn fairness to Ross at least, he seems to have made a late in life conversion to the GOP having supported Mitt Romney in 2012 and then Trump from early on in this cycle.\n\n\n\nLike most Americans probably feel, it\u2019s hard to form an opinion on the appointments of Ross and Mnuchin because they\u2019re not well-known figures outside of the elite financial circles of the country. The fact that they appear to be \u201cswamp creatures\u201d is alarming, but at some point we have to accept Trump is going to bring onboard the people he trusts most to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd the odds are Trump will get what he wants from the Senate in terms of confirmations, too.\n\n\n\nAnna Giaritelli of the Washington Examiner reports, \u201cSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fl., said on Tuesday evening he expects the Republican-led Senate to approve President-elect Trump's Cabinet appointments, thanks to the low grade \u2018nuclear option\u2019 Senate Democrats enabled three years ago when they controlled the upper chamber.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2019If you look at the nominations, they changed the rules. And now by 51 votes we can get anybody confirmed except for the Supreme Court and so that's why I fully anticipate that by and large, unless it's someone - something troubling comes out, you're going to see the president-elect get his nominees,\u2019 the recently reelected senator told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn essence, there\u2019s not much anyone from either side of the ideological spectrum can do to stop these appointments. Unless there\u2019s widespread Republican opposition (and by widespread, I\u2019m guessing more than four or five GOP senators), on virtually any nomination, Trump will get his way.\n\n\n\nThe prospect brings with it some apprehension, but at some point we have to allow Trump leeway to make the choices. We elected him to do just that.\n\n\n\nTeflon Rom meets with Trump on Tuesday night, still no word on Secretary of State\n\n\n\nSpeaking of trust \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 Mitt Romney emerged from his meeting with Donald Trump on Tuesday beaming from ear to ear and talking up his conversation with the president-elect.\n\n\n\nAnna Giaritelli of the Washington Examiner reports, \u201cMitt Romney, one of President-elect Trump's remaining candidates for secretary of state, called his Tuesday dinner with Trump and incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus \u2018engaging\u2019 and \u2018enlightening,\u2019 during an informal press conference following the meeting...\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 2012 Republican presidential nominee praised Trump's professionalism in what may be an attempt by Romney to make up for comments on the campaign trail earlier this year bashing the billionaire businessman as a man whose leadership would trigger \u2018trickle-down racism.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTherein lies the problem with the whole concept of having Romney serve a prominent role in the Trump administration. It\u2019s not that Romney isn\u2019t a decent man with an impressive life resume and a pleasant public demeanor. If you need a guy to trust with babysitting your kids, Mitt should be at the top of the list.\n\n\n\nBut should Romney receive the Secretary of State nod \u2013 or any cabinet post, really \u2013 how is he going to get past all the awful things he said about Trump during the campaign?\n\n\n\nI think most people are willing to look beyond the sometimes vicious back-and-forth exchanges between Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio and Trump because they were campaign competitors and lofting bombs is something politicians do to set contrasts during the heat of battle. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 most of the time politicians do a remarkable job of keeping their composure under tough circumstances\u2026but sometimes they say things they later regret.\n\n\n\nRomney, however, was offering those types of savage barbs about Trump and he wasn\u2019t even in the race. He was resting comfortably behind a microphone somewhere proffering opinions on people who couldn\u2019t strike back in any meaningful way. There\u2019s no accountability there. Romney might as well have been a paid pundit on MSNBC for the things he was saying.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Mitt was stung by Trump\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t try hard enough to win in 2012, or maybe Romney was just trying to salvage his own political legacy, but by all-but saying Trump is a racist and a misogynist \u2013 those things are hard to take back.\n\n\n\nShould Romney end up in the Trump administration, those questions would dog him the entire time in office.\n\n\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, there are those who believe Romney looked uncomfortable during his meeting with Trump. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but the video of Romney\u2019s post-meeting remarks betray a confident \u2013 and hopeful \u2013 man.\n\n\n\nLike with his other cabinet selections, until he proves otherwise, Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt. In meeting with Romney and other potential appointees, Trump is merely doing what we asked him to do \u2013 thoroughly vet his candidates. The coming days and weeks will reveal what he\u2019s discovered.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cThank You\u201d tour draws comparisons to\u2026Obama\n\n\n\nAway from his transition offices Donald Trump is planning something a little non-traditional for presidents in waiting. He\u2019s about to embark on a \u201ctour\u201d of states he won, speaking in large venues to thank supporters for electing him.\n\n\n\nIn doing so, some observers are accusing him of waging a \u201cpermanent campaign\u201d like Obama did after he won in 2008.\n\n\n\nDavid M. Drucker of the Washington Examiner wrote, \u201cSome Republican insiders, however, are worried that Trump is inviting the same fate (as Obama) by acting politically so soon. Embarking on what is essentially a campaign swing, in states where Trump won, could make it difficult for Trump to unify the country and encourage Democrats in Congress to work with him.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's especially the case, concerned Republicans say, given the partisan and occasionally controversial nature of Trump's rallies, both in terms of his rhetoric and audience behavior.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf by \u201caudience behavior\u201d Drucker means violence, we all know (thanks to James O\u2019Keefe of Project Veritas) that the incidents in several places were provoked by paid leftists intent on causing trouble.\n\n\n\nIf \u201cbehavior\u201d includes the chants of \u201clock her up!\u201d that usually accompanied Trump\u2019s prolonged restatements of Hillary Clinton\u2019s crimes, it should be easy enough to control going forward. Now that Clinton has been vanquished and is only making headlines these days by joining in with fruitless recount missions, there\u2019s no real need for Trump to talk about her anymore.\n\n\n\n\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d is old news. Been there, done that.\n\n\n\nInstead, Trump can and should tailor his remarks toward the future, highlighting the people he\u2019s now putting in place to implement the policies that he promoted during his year and a half long campaign. Trump can demonstrate how he\u2019s going to get rid of Obamacare and sanctuary cities. He can talk about the tax cut measures he\u2019ll push. And he can explain his thoughts on foreign policy under a Trump administration.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, Trump can encourage supporters to stay informed and engaged.\n\n\n\nIf done properly Trump can keep people enthused for the tough work to come. He\u2019ll need some support from Democrats but he otherwise has enough Republicans to pass the major initiatives.\n\n\n\nFar from the \u201cpermanent campaign,\u201d Trump is merely keeping his populist army mobilized and peaceful.\n\n\n\nThen, unlike with Obama, there will be real hope and change.", "image": "http://tinyurl.com/hhyfarg", "title": "Transition to Trump: Should conservatives just trust Trump on his cabinet choices?", "summary": "Far from the \u201cpermanent campaign,\u201d Trump is merely keeping his populist army mobilized and peaceful.\nHe then founded the motion picture firm, RatPac-Dune Entertainment.\u201dHe also served as finance chair for Trump\u2019s campaign.\nTrump can demonstrate how he\u2019s going to get rid of Obamacare and sanctuary cities.\nAnd all the rumors circulating around Mitt Romney and the Secretary of State\u2019s post\u2026well, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ll wait until someone is named before the universe explodes on that one.\nThe prospect brings with it some apprehension, but at some point we have to allow Trump leeway to make the choices.", "source": "Conservative HQ", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["cabinet", "trump", "campaign", "hes", "romney", "mitt", "transition", "washington", "choices", "going", "trumps", "conservatives", "mnuchin", "trust", "ross"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-30 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/economy/trump-saved-jobs-at-carrier-but-more-midwest-jobs-are-in-jeopardy.html?_r=0", "text": "Indeed, Rexnord, the ball bearing factory in Indianapolis where Mr. Jones went to work straight out of high school nearly 40 years ago, said in October it would be moving to Mexico.

Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. \u201cBut by itself, the disappearance or retention of 1,000 jobs is a small slice of the total economy in Indiana.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there will be continued downward pressure on employment in factories because of trends toward automation especially and moving to lower-cost areas for production,\u201d he added.\n\nCarrier, in its official statement on the deal on Wednesday, said that it thought the agreement it negotiated with Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u201cbenefits our workers, the state of Indiana and our company.\u201d But it said that incentives provided by Indiana, where Mr. Pence is governor, \u201cwere an important consideration.\u201d It added that \u201cthe forces of globalization will continue to require solutions for the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and American workers.\u201d\n\nThose 1,000 Carrier jobs saved represent just 0.2 percent of total manufacturing employment in the state. And despite a rebound since the aftermath of the Great Recession, at just over half a million positions, factory employment in Indiana this year is still down by more than 20 percent since 2000.\n\nThe good news is that Indiana has been doing well economically, with an unemployment rate below the national average and steady gains in employment like food service, retail and logistics.\n\nBut those service jobs pay well below the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran Carrier employees \u2014 with only a high school diploma \u2014 can earn building furnaces and fan coils in Indianapolis. The typical manufacturing worker in the state earns $59,000 a year, about $20,000 a year more than the typical service job.\n\nAnd for less credentialed workers, that margin is the difference between having a shot at a middle-class life, including owning a home and sending children to college, and having to struggle to make ends meet.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese are truly irreplaceable jobs,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an advocacy group, and a native of Rensselaer, Ind. \u201cA manufacturing job is one of the only ladders to fulfilling the American dream for a worker without a college degree.\u201d\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But obviously, Donald Trump and Mike Pence can\u2019t intervene every time a plant closes.\u201d\n\nThe economic fortunes for this group have been shrinking for years, which is a major reason the story of Mr. Trump and Carrier has resonated so deeply.\n\nIn Indiana, in particular, as in other so-called Rust Belt states, there are a lot of people who are less educated: Just 16.5 percent of the state\u2019s residents ages 25 to 64 have a bachelor\u2019s degree, half the rate for the country over all. And while about 30 percent have an associate degree or some college, the bulk of Indiana residents, 44 percent, have only a high school diploma \u2014 or less.\n\nTrump and the Carrier Factory In February, Carrier told its workers in Indiana that it would move 1,400 jobs to Mexico. Donald J. Trump, then a candidate, seized on the issue and made the planned move a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade.\n\nNor has manufacturing remained the sole domain of whites. It provides a crucial source of higher-paying jobs for minorities.\n\nIn the popular imagination, the Indianapolis factory where 1,400 Carrier workers build furnaces and fan coils looks like a scene out of \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d or \u201cNorma Rae.\u201d Blue-collar guys walking through the plant gate, lunch pail in hand, or white women barely getting by after years on the line.\n\nBut the reality at the Carrier plant that Mr. Trump will visit on Thursday is very different. About half the workers are African-American, making it a much more diverse workplace than many white-collar settings.\n\nWomen account for a substantial portion of the work force as well, but the wages are anything but subsistence: over $20 an hour plus benefits for workers with just a high school diploma. That is an almost unheard-of level of pay for Indiana workers with that level of education in other sectors like food service and retail or even many health care jobs.\n\nCarol Bigbee, 59, who has worked at Carrier for over 13 years, earns $22 an hour.

But more than 60 Democrats voted against her \u2015 a stunning level of dissent at a time when the party is trying to pick up the pieces after a disastrous presidential election.\n\nPelosi defeated her lone challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), by a vote of 134 to 63. It\u2019s a decisive win, and it (barely) clears the two-thirds majority support that Pelosi predicted she had.

It\u2019s about the character of America,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHow we go forward in our caucus to put forth our values, which are what unite us a caucus, to differentiate between us and the administration that will come into Washington in January, to take that message clearly to the public, is something that is a historic challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know how to win elections,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.\u201d\n\nAsked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, \u201cI got two-thirds of the vote.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Ryan told reporters the race didn\u2019t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did \u201ca pretty good job\u201d of bringing economic issues to the forefront.\n\n\u201cI think we got the message out,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in my heart, if we\u2019re going to win as Democrats, we have to have the kind of message that resonates in every corner of this country.\u201d\n\nDuring the closed-door caucus meeting, several Democrats went to bat for Pelosi. Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Gwen Moore (Wis.), Bill Pascrell (N.J.), Katherine Clark (Mass.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Debbie Dingell (Mich.) each gave nominating speeches for her.\n\n\u201cEverything we care about [is] at risk,\u201d Schiff told the room. \u201cWe need the very best to lead us. No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi. No one does it better. No one even comes close.\u201d\n\nDingell said she has spoken \u201cendlessly\u201d to Pelosi about appealing to Midwestern voters, and said she gets it. \u201cLeader Pelosi always listened and she always understood.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s understanding of Midwesterners, or lack thereof, is what Ryan highlighted as the party\u2019s biggest problem. He said the California progressive has lost the connection with working-class people in the Midwest \u2015 the same people who make up his district, and the same people who turned out in droves to vote for Trump and help defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWhen you see working-class people, blue-collar people, going and voting for Trump, that\u2019s a failure of the Democratic Party because they felt like we didn\u2019t care about them,\u201d Ryan said earlier this month. \u201cThat just makes my stomach sick.\u201d\n\nPelosi did not agree with Ryan\u2019s assessment in a Monday interview with The Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton, so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s saying that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have strong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area ...

Sources told Fox News on Tuesday that Mnuchin would be nominated. Two weeks ago, businessman and close Trump associate Carl Icahn tweeted that Trump was considering Mnuchin for the post.\n\nThe 53-year-old Mnuchin was in May appointed Trump's campaign finance chairman. Through his work, Mnuchin grew close to Trump's children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- a top adviser to Trump -- and worked with them on fundraising events.\n\n\n\nThe campaign raised at least $169 million, in addition to the $66 million Trump spent out of his own pocket. Though that was far short of what Hillary Clinton raised, it represented an impressive haul given that Trump didn't begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May.\n\nIf approved by the Senate, Mnuchin would follow in the tradition of two previous treasury secretaries -- Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and Henry Paulson in George W. Bush's. All had vast Wall Street experience gained from years spent working at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\n\nYet unlike Rubin and Paulson and unlike President Obama's two treasury secretaries, Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew, Mnuchin would bring no government experience to Treasury, something that could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1985. Mnuchin worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years. His father, Robert Mnuchin, had himself worked for Goldman for three decades, becoming a partner in charge of equity trading.\n\n\n\nThe younger Mnuchin amassed his own fortune at the firm and then left in 2002. He worked briefly for Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund led by George Soros, before starting his own investment firm, Dune Capital Management.\n\n\n\nAs head of this firm, Mnuchin and other investors participated in the purchase of failed mortgage lender IndyMac in 2009 and renamed it OneWest. The failure of IndyMac in 2008 with $32 billion in assets was one of the biggest casualties of the housing bust.\n\n\n\nMnuchin became chairman of OneWest, which was sold to CIT Group in 2015. Before the sale, OneWest faced a string of lawsuits over its home foreclosure practices.\n\n\n\nThis month, housing advocates filed a complaint asking the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate OneWest for possible violations of the Fair Housing Act. The lender failed to place branches in minority communities, provided few mortgages to black homebuyers and preserved foreclosed properties in white neighborhoods while allowing similar homes in minority communities to fall into disrepair, according to the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California.\n\n\n\nCIT declined to respond directly to the complaint but stressed in a statement that it is \"committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.\"\n\n\n\nMnuchin also became a major investor in Hollywood, helping finance a number of movies, including the 2009 blockbuster \"Avatar.\"\n\n\n\nAs treasury secretary, Mnuchin would be the administration's chief economic spokesman, serving as a liaison not only to Wall Street but also to global investors, a critical role given the trillions of dollars in treasury bonds owned by foreigners. In addition, it would be his job to sell the new administration's economic program to Congress.\n\n\n\nMnuchin will also oversee a sprawling bureaucracy that includes the Internal Revenue Service and the agency that issues millions of Social Security and other benefit checks each month. Treasury also runs the agency that wages the financial war on terrorism.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump officially nominated Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as Health and Human Services Secretary and tapped Elaine Chao, former President George W. Bush's Labor Secretary, to be secretary of transportation.\n\nPrice, a former surgeon, supports the repeal of ObamaCare and has offered a replacement that would provide tax credits to subsidize the purchase of individual and family health insurance policies. His proposal would also allow insurers to sell policies across state line, boost incentives for health savings accounts, and create high-risk pools to help individuals afford coverage, while barring assistance for nearly all abortions.\n\nPrice has emerged as a top advocate of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to transform Medicare from a program that supplies a defined set of benefits into a \"premium support\" model that would, similar to Obamacare, offer subsidies for participants to purchase health care directly from insurance companies. He also wants the Medicare eligibility age to rise to 67.\n\nPrice also backs, as does Trump, a plan by House Republicans to sharply cut the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled and turn it over to the states to run. Like Trump and most other Republicans, Price wants federal funding withdrawn from Planned Parenthood, which has come under attack for its practice of supplying tissue from aborted fetuses to medical researchers.\n\nIf confirmed as Transportation Secretary, Chao would face many pressing issues, such as how to boost the nation's aging infrastructure so that it can accommodate population growth and not become a drag on the economy, modernizing the nation's air traffic control system, ensuring that new transportation technologies are adopted in a safe manner and responding to a surge in traffic fatalities.\n\nAfter serving in the Bush administration, Chao served on the board of directors for Bloomberg Philanthropies, run by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. She resigned last year after learning the organization planned to expand an environmental initiative to shutter coal-fired power plants.\n\nAlmost 90 percent of Kentucky's electricity comes from coal, and Chao's ties to the organization were used against her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, during his 2014 re-election campaign.\n\nFox News' John Roberts and Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.

Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and of Seema Verma, president and CEO of a health consulting company, to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, saying both nominees bring extensive expertise and a firm commitment to reform.\n\nMr. Trump also said he will nominate Elaine L. Chao, who ran the Labor Department under President George W. Bush, as his transportation secretary \u2014 a position that could be key to the president-elect\u2019s plans for a massive infrastructure program that includes rebuilding roads and bridges throughout the country.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Mr. Trump also has chosen Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary, a choice whose Wall Street ties Democrats quickly touted as a betrayal of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests in Washington.\n\nAlthough Democrats suggested an openness to Ms. Chao, who is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, they said they\u2019ll also rally against Mr. Price, a staunch pro-life advocate and architect of House Republicans\u2019 budgets the last two years \u2014 blueprints that envisioned major changes to Medicare and called for fast-track procedures to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans plan to rely on those same fast-track tools to attempt a repeal in 2017, when they\u2019ll have GOP allies in the administration.\n\n\u201cWe could not ask for a better partner to work with Congress to fix our nation\u2019s health care challenges,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said.\n\nMr. Price offered his own legislative alternative to Obamacare for years, pushing for the repeal of heavy government mandates while maintaining some form of tax credits to help Americans to buy insurance, allowing insurers to sell their products across states lines and setting up high-risk pools in states \u2014 ideas that Mr. Ryan incorporated into his election-year outline for replacing Mr. Obama\u2019s overhaul with a GOP president.\n\nThe incoming Republican president, Mr. Trump, said he\u2019s counting on Mr. Price to manage the GOP\u2019s tricky path ahead.\n\n\u201cHe is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nDemocrats were spoiling for a fight.\n\n\u201cNominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house,\u201d said incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.\n\nMr. Price succeeded Mr. Ryan as chairman of the Budget Committee in 2015, and adopted Mr. Ryan\u2019s push to morph Medicare into a premium-support program. That idea is a political lightning rod that didn\u2019t win over Mr. Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nMr. Price also has supported turning Medicaid coverage for the poor into a block grant to the states and stripping federal funding from Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider.\n\nDemocrats said as health secretary, Mr. Price would have control over funding and policies governing federal policies on abortion and contraceptives \u2014 areas where they said the pro-life congressman could undo Obama administration decisions.\n\nThough a less prominent role than HHS secretary, Ms. Verma would have direct management over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s twin pillars \u2014 web-based exchanges where consumers can shop for private coverage, often with the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies, and the state-by-state expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor.\n\nMs. Verma rose to prominence by setting up the Healthy Indiana Plan, the state\u2019s conservative twist on Medicaid expansion that started under former Gov. Mitch Daniels and was modified under Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the state\u2019s current governor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an outstanding choice. She\u2019s the godmother of conservative thinking on how to make Medicaid more efficient and more effective,\u201d said Robert Laszewski, a health care policy consultant in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAnalysts said Ms. Verma could serve as a powerful bridge for red states, using her waiver authority to grant them wide latitude in how they implement Medicaid until the GOP decides whether to overhaul the program.\n\nFor instance, Republican governors who\u2019d fought with the Obama administration over work requirements or charging premiums on certain enrollees will now find a sympathetic ear in Ms. Verma.\n\n\u201cBefore and after any legislative changes, she has the ability to let individual states make the kind of reforms they might be interested in,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere, a D.C.-based health consultancy.\n\nManaging the exchanges could pose a tougher test, analysts said, if insurers flee a politically doomed program before Republicans figure out how to cover the millions of people who gained taxpayer-subsidized coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-run websites.\n\nRepublicans had hoped to have a replacement to go along with the repeal of Obamacare, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday signaled their new strategy could involve a quick repeal, then a longer-term effort at replacement.\n\nHe said they would probably create a \u201ctransition\u201d period to give stakeholders \u2014 including governors and state insurance commissioners \u2014 space to weigh in on what the replacement package would look like, though he didn\u2019t provide a timeline.\n\nMr. McCarthy said the repeal can be done through fast-track procedures that only require a majority vote in the Senate, but any replacement plan would need 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic filibuster. At best, Senate Republicans will hold 52 seats in the coming Congress.\n\nObamacare is already failing and cannot sustain itself, Mr. McCarthy argued, so Democrats will be under pressure to come to the table if the law is repealed and both sides have a deadline to move forward with something else.\n\n\u201cWhen that date came and you did nothing \u2014 if you want to play politics, I think blame would go to people who didn\u2019t want to do anything,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat, signaled Tuesday he\u2019d be open to working with Republicans, but only if they show their cards from the start.\n\n\u201cI would like to see what they put forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI am amicable to anything, but [only] if it makes sense.

Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said on Twitter that she had received \u201ca deluge\u201d of concern from people warning against picking Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose raising concerns about Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an early and loyal supporter of Mr. Trump, have said they fear that his tangle of foreign business ties could lead to a damaging confirmation battle. They also worry that Mr. Giuliani lacks the vigor for the globe-trotting job.\n\nBoth Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani have made their interest in the role known to Mr. Trump. But while Mr. Giuliani has been very public about his intentions \u2014 angering Mr. Trump at times with his statements \u2014 Mr. Romney has been more reserved.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe split over the two men has opened the door for another candidate altogether. One potential pick Mr. Trump and his team have entertained is Gen. John F. Kelly of the Marines, a former head of the United States Southern Command. Others are David H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C.I.A. director, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, according to two people involved in the process.\n\nAsked about Mr. Trump\u2019s deliberations, a spokesman, Jason Miller, said in an email Thursday, \u201cThe president-elect is meeting with a number of well-qualified potential selections for this important position who share his America First foreign policy \u2014 some of whom have been made public and others who have not \u2014 and the president-elect will make public his decision when he has finalized it.\u201d\n\nMr. Romney would represent a departure from the hard-liners Mr. Trump has already picked for his national security team. But aides like Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, have expressed doubts about Mr. Romney\u2019s loyalty given his denunciation of Mr. Trump as a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d Mr. Bannon and others have told colleagues they fear that a State Department under Mr. Romney could turn into something of a rogue agency.\n\nAsked to explain her Twitter post about Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway said that while she trusted Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment, she found it notable that the most outrage directed at Mr. Trump from the party\u2019s grass-roots \u201cis not against something he said, but something he may do.\u201d In another post, she said that being \u201cloyal\u201d was an important characteristic for a secretary of state.\n\nOthers hoping to catch Mr. Trump\u2019s ear have taken their message to a place they know he is likely to absorb it: cable news. Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, who has spoken with Mr. Trump about his concerns that Mr. Giuliani would not be confirmed by the Senate, has taken to making those arguments on a daily basis on his morning show, which he knows Mr. Trump watches.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Huckabee, who said during the 2008 presidential campaign that Mr. Romney reminded voters of \u201cthe guy who laid them off,\u201d told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Mr. Romney would be \u201ca real insult\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. Mr. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republican voters who turned out in large numbers to lift Mr. Trump to victory.\n\nSean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Mr. Trump often privately solicits, has also been deeply critical of Mr. Romney on his show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShortly after the election, Mr. Giuliani told associates that he believed the job was his. He had communicated to Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut he began to run afoul of Mr. Trump when he told a Wall Street Journal forum that he would probably be a better candidate than John R. Bolton, who served as one of George W. Bush\u2019s ambassadors to the United Nations.\n\nAnd when reports surfaced about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s foreign business entanglements and highly compensated speechmaking, Mr. Trump grew even warier. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nAs a backup plan, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides encouraged him to meet with Mr. Romney. Though some in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, like Reince Priebus, his choice for chief of staff, thought that such a meeting would anger the president-elect\u2019s supporters, Mr. Trump went ahead. In the meantime, he started sounding out Mr. Giuliani on a different post, director of national intelligence. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have discussed the role for Mr. Giuliani, but there has been no indication he wants it.\n\nWhat many people believed would be a perfunctory meeting with Mr. Romney last weekend at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., turned into something more substantial.\n\nMr. Trump liked Mr. Romney quite a bit, and was intrigued by the possibility of such a camera-ready option to represent the country around the globe, advisers to Mr. Trump said. The following day, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump and urged him to make a decision in one direction or the other.\n\nMr. Romney, who was mocked in 2012 when he described Russia as the greatest geopolitical foe of the United States, has seen his stock in the Republican Party rise since his loss to President Obama, although he is still viewed skeptically by the party\u2019s grass-roots. His allies believe that his position on Russia has been vindicated, but it is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire for a better relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nPrivately, Mr. Giuliani has expressed his frustration at going from front-runner for secretary of state to a contender who has to convince Mr. Trump of his strengths. He is particularly irritated over the focus on his business ties.\n\nThe option of a third person like General Kelly has gained currency in recent days inside the transition team. A respected leader, General Kelly served as the senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. He led the Southern Command, responsible for all United States military activities in South and Central America, for four years under Mr. Obama.

We're about seeing all sides through thoughtful consideration and lively, considerate debate.\n\nAnd, because we're dedicated to the idea that we can disagree while being respectful, we like to support healthy conversations, especially around the holidays.\n\nIn that spirit, we offer the following tips for harmonious holiday dialog (with assistance from Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, Heather Sutherland):\n\n1. Respect that feelings are at stake.\n\nPolitical discussions typically turn ugly when people feel they aren\u2019t being heard or understood - or worse, when they feel feel judged. Remember to keep judgment out of political conversations.\n\nIt can help to remind yourself that most people do not form their opinions on pure logic and facts, and you can't persuade someone whose emotions are worked up. Sometimes the kindest thing to do is simply respect that they are entitled to their opinion, no matter how much you disagree with it, and move along.\n\n2. Assess the situation. Speak accordingly.\n\nFamilies are a sensitive system. One tense spat between two people can taint the evening for everyone else. If you know that certain political topics could turn ugly fast with a particular person, make a choice to avoid that topic around that person.\n\nSutherland says it's about \"setting your boundaries - either as a group, or with each person individually.\" For example, if someone you are talking to brings up a topic you have strong feelings on, such as the healthcare law, and you don't think you can discuss it respectfully, you could let them know it\u2019s not a good topic for you at the moment and change the subject.\n\n3. When you talk politics, keep the focus on issues instead of political identity.\n\nAs soon as we label people, our brains get into trouble. Suddenly this person we are speaking to is associated with \u201ceverything\u201d that upsets us politically. That's not fair to them. Therefore, avoid using terms like liberal or conservative and don\u2019t dwell on the character flaws of certain liberal or conservative icons either.\n\nInstead, discuss the issues: focus on the facts without the baggage of stereotypes and old party resentments.\n\nAfter all, most of us - whether we know it or not - are not purely Democrat, Republican, or Libertarian in our views. We are more complex than that, according to the research. For example, consider the 2013 United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll. When Americans were surveyed on their issue views (without using Left or Right labels) they were rarely completely in line with traditional Republican or Democrat views. Rather, most folks agreed with some Democratic views and some Republican views, regardless of their claimed political identity.\n\nWe've included links below to some of the AllSides Issue pages in case you'd like to read up on certain news and opinions before you gather with family this season.\n\nAfter all, dialog is a healthy part of a great democracy. Here's to holiday harmony between you and your multi-partisan loved ones.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!", "image": "http://www.allsides.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_main_image/public/4136809491_fe29c3093c_b.jpg?itok=B71kjuk-", "title": "Holiday Table Conversations", "summary": "Political discussions typically turn ugly when people feel they aren\u2019t being heard or understood - or worse, when they feel feel judged.\nRather, most folks agreed with some Democratic views and some Republican views, regardless of their claimed political identity.\nIn that spirit, we offer the following tips for harmonious holiday dialog (with assistance from Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, Heather Sutherland):1.\nAnd, because we're dedicated to the idea that we can disagree while being respectful, we like to support healthy conversations, especially around the holidays.\nIf you know that certain political topics could turn ugly fast with a particular person, make a choice to avoid that topic around that person.", "source": "AllSides", "bias": "Bias: Mixed", "authors": [], "keywords": ["holiday", "using", "views", "feel", "conversations", "political", "topic", "person", "know", "certain", "table", "republican"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-23 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/23/5-things-know-trumps-united-nations-pick-sc-gov-nikki-haley/94333682/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Gov.

She was the Tea Party backed candidate.\n\nShe vehemently spoke against Trump on the campaign trail\n\nShe may have been chosen by Trump, but Haley is not a long-time supporter of the president-elect. She criticized Trump throughout the Republican nomination campaign and endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during the South Carolina primary. After Rubio dropped out, Haley backed Trump opponent Ted Cruz. In October, she said she would vote for Trump, but was \u201cnot a fan.\u201d\n\nShe is the daughter of immigrants from India\n\nHaley was not only the first female governor in South Carolina, but also the first minority governor. As the daughter of immigrants from India, Haley was outspoken against Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance when she gave the Republican Party response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in January.\n\n\"During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,\" Haley said. \"We must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.\"\n\nTrump reacted by calling her stance on immigration \u201cweak.\u201d \"She's very weak on illegal immigration,\" he said during Fox & Friends. \"I feel very strongly about immigration. She doesn't.\"\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much foreign policy experience\n\nHaley has little foreign policy experience, but supporters noted she has traveled abroad at least eight times during her two terms as South Carolina governor. Her husband Michael was deployed to Afghanistan's Helmand Province in 2013 as a member of the Army National Guard. The couple have two children: Rena, 18, and Nalin, 15.\n\nShe called on the state to remove the Confederate flag: \u2018It\u2019s time to move\u2019 it\n\nFollowing the horrific killing of nine black church members by a white gunman in June of 2015, Haley called on the state to remove the Confederate flag from the statehouse. The massacre prompted many in South Carolina to question whether the flag's presence on public property delivered a not-so-subtle message of bigotry.\n\n\"For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble. Traditions of history, of heritage, and of ancestry,\" Haley, a Republican, said. \"At the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.\"\n\nSouth Carolina later removed a Confederate flag from its Capitol grounds.\n\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman\n\nContributing: David Jackson and William Cummings.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gkfopa", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/041b79c329ac6d4eb0467c273a23c1efb32c80b2/c=0-158-3119-1920&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/11/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636154810709699911-AP-TRUMP-HALEY-86919604.JPG", "title": "5 things to know about Trump's U.N. pick", "summary": "The massacre prompted many in South Carolina to question whether the flag's presence on public property delivered a not-so-subtle message of bigotry.\n\"At the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.\n\"She doesn\u2019t have much foreign policy experienceHaley has little foreign policy experience, but supporters noted she has traveled abroad at least eight times during her two terms as South Carolina governor.\nUSA TODAY NETWORKPresident-elect Donald Trump has chosen South Carolina Gov.\nShe criticized Trump throughout the Republican nomination campaign and endorsed Florida Sen.

Trump spent $20,000 that belonged to the Donald J. Trump Foundation to buy a six-foot-tall portrait of himself painted by Israel. (Michael Israel)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation has admitted to the Internal Revenue Service that it violated a legal prohibition against \u201cself-dealing,\u201d which bars nonprofit leaders from using their charity\u2019s money to help themselves, their businesses or their families.\n\nThe admission was contained in the Donald J. Trump Foundation\u2019s IRS tax filings for 2015, which were recently posted online at the nonprofit-tracking site GuideStar. A GuideStar spokesman said the forms were uploaded by the Trump Foundation\u2019s law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.\n\nThe Washington Post could not immediately confirm if the same forms had actually been sent to the IRS.\n\nIn one section of the form, the IRS asked whether the Trump Foundation had transferred \u201cincome or assets to a disqualified person.\u201d A disqualified person, in this context, might be Trump \u2014 the foundation\u2019s president \u2014 or a member of his family or a Trump-owned business.\n\nThe foundation checked yes.\n\n\n\nFor 2015, the Trump Foundation checked \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether it had transferred \u201cincome or assets to a disqualified person\u201d \u2014 which in this context might be Trump, a member of his family or a Trump-owned business \u2014 and checked \u201cyes\u201d again when asked if it had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. For 2014, The foundation answered \u201cno\u201d to these questions.\n\nAnother line on the form asked whether the Trump Foundation had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. The Trump Foundation checked yes again.\n\nSuch violations can carry penalties including excise taxes, and the charity leaders can be required to repay money that the charity spent on their behalf.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, The Post reported on several instances in which Trump appeared to use the Trump Foundation\u2019s money to buy items for himself or to help one of his for-profit businesses.\n\nBut the new Trump Foundation tax filings provided little detail, so it was unclear if these admissions were connected to the instances reported in The Post.\n\n[Trump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words.]\n\nThe Trump Foundation tax forms did not, for instance, describe any specific acts of self-dealing. They also did not say whether Trump had paid any penalties already. That kind of detail would be submitted on a separate IRS form, which was not included in the information posted online by GuideStar.\n\nTrump\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nWashington Post reporter David A. Fahrenthold has been searching for evidence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s charitable giving for months. (Peter Stevenson,Julio Negron/The Washington Post)\n\nThe New York attorney general\u2019s office is investigating Trump\u2019s charity, following up on reports in The Post that described apparent instances of self-dealing going back to 2007. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment, other than to say \u201cour investigation is ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe IRS also did not immediately respond. That agency has not said if it is investigating the president-elect\u2019s charity.\n\nThe Trump Foundation has existed since 1987. This appeared to be the first time that it had admitted committing such a violation.\n\nPhilip Hackney, who formerly worked in the IRS chief counsel\u2019s office and now teaches at Louisiana State University, said he wanted to know why the Trump Foundation was now admitting to self-dealing in prior years \u2014 when, in all prior years, it had told the IRS it had done nothing of the kind.\n\n\u201cWhat transactions led to the self-dealing that they\u2019re admitting to? Why weren\u2019t they able to recognize them in prior years,\u201d Hackney said. He said that, since the prior years\u2019 returns were signed by Trump, that opened the president-elect to questions about what he had missed and how.\n\nTrump Foundation 2015 tax filing\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, The Post revealed several instances \u2014 worth about $300,000 \u2014 where Trump seemed to have used the Trump Foundation to help himself. From 2009 until this year, the charity was funded exclusively with other people\u2019s money, an arrangement that experts say is almost unheard of for a family foundation.\n\nIn two cases, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation appeared to pay legal settlements to end lawsuits that involved his for-profit businesses.\n\nIn one case, Trump settled a dispute with the town of Palm Beach, Fla., over a large flagpole he erected at his Mar-a-Lago Club. The town agreed to waive $120,000 in unpaid fines if Trump\u2019s club donated $100,000 to Fisher House, a charity helping wounded veterans and military personnel. The Trump Foundation paid that donation instead \u2014 effectively saving his business $100,000.\n\nIn another, Trump\u2019s golf course in New York\u2019s Westchester County was sued by a man who had won a $1 million hole-in-one prize during a tournament at the course. The man was later denied the money because Trump\u2019s course had allegedly made the hole too short for the prize to be valid.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled, and details on that final settlement have not been made public. But on the day that the parties told the court that their lawsuit had been settled, the Trump Foundation donated $158,000 to the unhappy golfer\u2019s charity. Trump\u2019s golf course donated nothing.\n\nIn three other cases, Trump\u2019s foundation paid for items that Trump or his wife purchased at charity auctions. In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 for a football helmet signed by then-Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. In another case from 2007, Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, bid $20,000 on a six-foot-tall portrait of Trump painted by \u201cspeed painter\u201d Michael Israel during a gala at Mar-a-Lago. And in 2014, Trump bid $10,000 to buy a four-foot painting of himself by artist Havi Schanz at another charity gala.\n\n[How a Univision anchor found the missing $10,000 portrait that Trump bought with his charity\u2019s money]\n\nIn all three cases, the Trump Foundation paid the bill. Tax experts said that, by law, the items had to be put to charitable use. Trump\u2019s representatives have not said what became of the helmet or the $20,000 portrait.\n\nThe $10,000 portrait was, however, located by Post readers, following coverage of the Trump Foundation. It was hanging on the wall of the sports bar at Trump\u2019s Doral golf resort, outside Miami.\n\nIn September, a Trump campaign spokesman rejected the idea that Trump had done anything wrong, by using his charity\u2019s money to buy art for his bar. Instead, spokesman Boris Epshteyn said, the sports bar was doing the charity a favor by \u201cstoring\u201d its art free of charge.\n\nTax experts said that this argument was unlikely to hold water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,\u201d Brett Kappel, a lawyer who advises nonprofit groups at the Akerman firm, told The Post then. \u201cBut this would do it.\u201d\n\nIn the new 2015 tax filing, the Trump Foundation acknowledged for the first time that it owned these items. But it listed market values far below what the foundation had paid: The helmet was valued at $475, the portrait purchased for $20,000 was valued at $700, and the portrait purchased for $10,000 was valued at $500.\n\nThe tax filing did not give any details about where these items are or what charitable use Trump has in mind for them.\n\nThe Trump Foundation\u2019s tax filing also shows that \u2014 for the first time in six years \u2014 the foundation received a donation from an entity controlled by Trump himself.\n\nIt lists a donation of $566,370 from the Trump Corporation, an entity 100 percent owned by Trump himself. It also lists a $50,000 gift from Trump Productions, a Trump-owned business that produced \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nPreviously, the last donation to the foundation from Trump or one of his businesses had come in 2008. Trump\u2019s spokesmen did not respond to a question about the reason for these new gifts.\n\nIn addition, the Trump Foundation reported a $150,000 gift from the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a powerful Ukrainian steel magnate. That was the first such gift from him.\n\nPinchuk, who supports closer ties between Ukraine and Western nations, had also pledged large donations to the foundation of Trump\u2019s presidential opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Those donations, pledged to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state, raised questions about whether she had conflicts of interest when she met with her family foundation\u2019s donors.\n\nA spokesman for Pinchuk\u2019s foundation said that the gift was made as part of an agreement for Trump to speak \u2014 via video link \u2014 to a conference Pinchuk organized in September 2015. The conference, called the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting, was held in Kiev. At the time of his 20-minute speech, titled \u201cHow New Ukraine\u2019s Fate Affects Europe and the World,\u201d Trump was already a presidential candidate.\n\nTrump\u2019s spokesmen did not respond to a question about Pinchuk\u2019s gift.\n\n[How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people\u2019s money]\n\nMarc S. Owens, the former head of the IRS nonprofit division, noted that this was a rare contribution to the Trump Foundation from overseas. The only other foreign gifts were small ones from New Zealand and Canada in 2006 and 2008. And it was certainly the first from a foreigner who could seek to influence the foreign policy agenda of a President Trump.\n\n\u201cThe contribution points out a potential way for foreign donors to align themselves with [Trump],\u201d Owens said.\n\nSo far, Trump has said nothing about how he will run his foundation when he takes office \u2014 or what he will do to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving Trump Foundation donors.\n\nIn contrast, when she was preparing to take office as secretary of state in 2009, Clinton was closely questioned about the operations of the global charity founded by her husband. As a result, the president of the Clinton Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration that placed certain restrictions on its activities, notably limiting some donations from foreign governments.\n\nThe agreement was criticized by Republicans during the campaign for loopholes, and the Clinton Foundation has also acknowledged at least one failure to fully uphold its terms. But the document showed an understanding that some additional transparency and regulations were needed while Clinton held public office.\n\n\u201cI will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised,\u201d Clinton said during her 2009 confirmation hearing. \u201cBut I think that the way that this has been hammered out is as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it, and we\u2019ve tried to do the very best we could.\u201d\n\nThe Post was first alerted to the 2015 tax filing by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. In a written statement, CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz said many questions remained to be answered.\n\n\u201cWhy were the Trumps unable to provide locations of the Foundation\u2019s assets like paintings and football helmets . . . when they clearly remain in the possession of the Foundation? What assets do [they] admit to transferring to a \u2018disqualified person?\u2019 \u201d Libowitz wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear at this point that the IRS needs to investigate.\u201d\n\nIn all, the 2015 tax filing shows that the Trump Foundation took in $781,000 and gave away $896,000 in grants during 2015. That left it with $1.1 million at year\u2019s end, slightly down from the year before.\n\nAn early look at its outgoing grants showed a familiar pattern: Trump gave to a smattering of New York and Florida charities, plus a few connected to friends and business partners. Also, as he entered the presidential race, he gave to several nonprofit organizations connected with conservative causes.\n\nOne of them was Project Veritas, the group run by conservative provocateur James O\u2019Keefe, which has used hidden-camera stings to target liberal groups. Stephen Gordon, of Project Veritas, said that its point of contact had been Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s one-time campaign manager.\n\nHe said they had a brief meeting with Trump in 2015 at Trump Tower. Trump gave $10,000 from his foundation to the group, which is an IRS-certified nonprofit organization.\n\n\u201cWe showed him a couple of videos. He thought that was really cool. And we walked out with a check. It was a typical donor meeting,\u201d Gordon recalled.\n\nRosalind S.

At one debate, he declared that his opponent should be in jail. The talk left many commentators appalled. Some argued that it was more customary to a banana republic than a modern democracy.\n\nBut Trump kept at it. His campaign was particularly critical of FBI Director James Comey for declining to recommend pressing charges over the summer. The team then praised him for examining fresh evidence regarding Clinton\u2019s emails with just days to go in the campaign, only to then suggest that the system was rigged when Comey announced he had found nothing new in his review.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters likely won\u2019t care that he is now backtracking on his pledge to prosecute Clinton.

These days it\u2019s the anti-racists, too. To raise money and mobilize people, advocates play up ethnic categories to an extreme degree.\n\nLarge parts of popular culture \u2014 and pretty much all of stand-up comedy \u2014 consist of reducing people to one or another identity and then making jokes about that generalization. The people who worry about cultural appropriation reduce people to an ethnic category and argue that those outside can never understand it. A single identity walls off empathy and the imagination.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe\u2019re even seeing a wave of voluntary reductionism. People feel besieged, or they\u2019re intellectually lazy, so they reduce themselves to one category. Being an evangelical used to mean practicing a certain form of faith. But \u201cevangelical\u201d has gone from being an adjective to a noun, a simplistic tribal identity that commands Republican affiliation.\n\nUnfortunately, if you reduce complex individuals to one thing you\u2019ll go through life clueless about the world around you. People\u2019s classifications now shape how they see the world.\n\nPlus, as the philosopher Amartya Sen has argued, this mentality makes the world more flammable. Crude tribal dividing lines inevitably arouse a besieged, victimized us/them mentality. This mentality assumes that the relations between groups are zero sum and antagonistic. People with this mentality tolerate dishonesty, misogyny and terrorism on their own side because all morality lays down before the tribal imperative.\n\nThe only way out of this mess is to continually remind ourselves that each human is a conglomeration of identities: ethnic, racial, professional, geographic, religious and so on. Even each identity itself is not one thing but a tradition of debate about the meaning of that identity. Furthermore, the dignity of each person is not found in the racial or ethnic category that each has inherited, but in the moral commitments that each individual has chosen and lived out.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For much of the 20th century, America had a rough consensus about the American idea. Historians congregated around a common narrative. People put great stock in civic rituals like the pledge. But that consensus is now in tatters, stretched by globalization, increasing diversity as well as failures of civic education.\n\nNow many Americans don\u2019t recognize one another or their country. The line I heard most on election night was, \u201cThis is not my America.\u201d We will have to construct a new national idea that binds and embraces all our particular identities.\n\nThe good news, as my Times colleague April Lawson points out, is that there wasn\u2019t mass violence last week. That could have happened amid a civic clash this ugly and passionate. That\u2019s a sign that for all the fear and anger of this season, there\u2019s still mutual attachment among us, something to build on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there has to be a rejection of single-identity thinking and a continual embrace of the reality that each of us is a mansion with many rooms.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/18/opinion/18brooksWeb/18brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "The Danger of a Dominant Identity", "summary": "But \u201cevangelical\u201d has gone from being an adjective to a noun, a simplistic tribal identity that commands Republican affiliation.\nEven each identity itself is not one thing but a tradition of debate about the meaning of that identity.\nThe only way out of this mess is to continually remind ourselves that each human is a conglomeration of identities: ethnic, racial, professional, geographic, religious and so on.\n\"Share Your Thoughts\" Go to FacebookBut it\u2019s not only racists who reduce people to a single identity.\nLarge parts of popular culture \u2014 and pretty much all of stand-up comedy \u2014 consist of reducing people to one or another identity and then making jokes about that generalization.", "source": "David Brooks", "bias": "Bias: Lean Right", "authors": ["David Brooks"], "keywords": ["dominant", "civic", "reduce", "tribal", "danger", "mentality", "times", "ethnic", "world", "racial", "identities", "identity"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-21 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-texas-missouri-police-shootings-20161121-story.html", "text": "A manhunt for a suspect in the fatal shooting of a veteran Texas police detective ended Monday evening with an arrest in the slaying, which was one of several weekend attacks that authorities say targeted law enforcement in multiple states.\n\nThe San Antonio detective as well as officers in Missouri and Florida were conducting routine tasks Sunday when they became the targets of violence.\n\nThe detective was writing a traffic ticket when he was shot to death in his squad car late Sunday morning outside police headquarters.\n\n\"I think the uniform was the target and the first person that happened along was the first person that (the suspect) targeted,\" San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said Monday.\n\nSNAP Video One police officer was killed and three wounded in separate U.S. cities on Sunday.

Minutes later, he and Vice President-elect came out the door to greet former Washington, D.C., schools chancellor Michelle Rhee for another private meeting.\n\nRomney and Trump had an often-contentious relationship throughout the 2016 campaign, with Romney labeling Trump as a \"phony, a fraud\" during the 2016 campaign, and Trump calling Romney a \"choke artist\" for losing his election to President Barack Obama.\n\nRomney did extend an olive branch to Trump with a phone call to congratulate him for his win, but Trump so far has chosen mostly loyalists for key roles, including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and retired Army Lieutenant Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser.\n\nHowever, for CIA director, Trump chose, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo who initially backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for the GOP nomination. Trump also met this past week with Sen.

John Kasich, who had dropped out of the race in May.\n\nAfter that, Priebus urged Trump and Romney to reconcile their differences, but even this summer, Romney told CNN that Trump's \"trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.\"\n\nRomney's views on Russia will also likely clash with Trump's. President Barack Obama, during a debate against Romney in 2012, ridiculed him for basing his foreign policy on the 1980s after Romney warned of the growing threat of Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for his leadership skills, and the Russian leader was one of the first world leaders to congratulate the new president-elect on his victory.\n\nBut while some are seeing Romney's meeting with Trump as a sign of party cooperation, others, such as Massachusetts Sen.

Sessions, an early Trump backer, is an immigration hard-liner who has been in the Senate since 1997 and previously served as attorney general for the state of Alabama.\n\nBack in the mid-1980s, when Sessions was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Reagan nominated him to become a federal judge. But during the nomination process, allegations emerged that Sessions had called a black attorney \u201cboy\u201d; that he suggested a white civil rights lawyer was a race traitor; that he joked he liked the Ku Klux Klan until he found out they smoked marijuana; and that he referred to civil rights groups as \u201cun-American\u201d organizations trying to \u201cforce civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.\u201d\n\nSenators also pressed Sessions on his failed prosecution of black political activists who were helping elderly black voters with absentee ballots. Sessions brought a case against Albert Turner, who walked behind Martin Luther King Jr. during the march in Selma, Alabama, and Turner\u2019s wife. They were found not guilty on all counts.\n\nAfter his judicial nomination was defeated, Sessions continued on as U.S. attorney for several years, until the end of the George H.W. Bush administration.\n\nTrump said in a statement on Friday that Sessions was a \u201cworld-class legal mind and considered a truly great Attorney General and U.S. Attorney in the state of Alabama.\u201d Trump said it was an honor to nominate Sessions to be the top law enforcement official in the United States.\n\nSessions said he was \u201chumbled\u201d to be nominated by Trump.\n\n\u201cMy previous 15 years working in the Department of Justice were extraordinarily fulfilling. I love the Department, its people and its mission. I can think of no greater honor than to lead them,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWith the support of my Senate colleagues, I will give all my strength to advance the Department\u2019s highest ideals. I enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump\u2019s vision for \u2018one America,\u2019 and his commitment to equal justice under law. I look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) had issued a statement Thursday night that said Sessions had the necessary experience to be the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official.\n\n\u201cNot only would Jeff bring integrity and immense expertise to the role of Attorney General due to his decades of experience in the legal field and an impressive tenure on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but Jeff has also gained the deep respect of his Senate colleagues for his commitment to upholding the rule of law,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cMy wife Annette and I are proud of Jeff\u2019s accomplishments and wish him and his wife Mary the very best during this exciting transition.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s nomination is already facing heavy opposition from civil rights organizations. Republicans will have control of the Senate 52-48 (including Sessions), so their margin for error is not great. If Sessions doesn\u2019t pick up any Democratic support, he could not afford to lose any Republican backers to maintain the simple majority he needs for confirmation.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, who voted against Sessions in 1986, said Friday that his Senate colleague deserves \u201ca full and fair process\u201d and that the \u201cAmerican people deserve to learn about Senator Sessions\u2019 record\u201d at a hearing. He said he had \u201csignificant disagreements\u201d with Sessions on civil rights and voting rights, as well as immigration and criminal justice issues.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General serves as the chief law enforcement officer in the country. The Attorney General must be independent and fair. The Attorney General must be deeply committed to the rule of law and must ensure that all people are treated equally before the law,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u201cThis means that he or she is also the chief protector of civil rights and civil liberties for everyone in our Nation. That has never been more important than in this moment, when hate crimes have spiked across the country, especially against Muslim and LGBTQ Americans. And when we have a President-elect who has proposed religious tests, a return to torture, and a deportation force that threatens to remove millions of immigrants.\u201d\n\nAs attorney general, Sessions would likely exercise broad influence over U.S. law enforcement, immigration policy and, specifically, how the nation\u2019s immigration laws are enforced.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to deport millions of undocumented residents, a position that dovetails with Sessions\u2019 fervent opposition to any immigration reform. Sessions is especially opposed to proposals that could be seen as a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for some of the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are currently living and working in the United States.\n\nSessions, who attended all-white segregated schools, was named for Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, and Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, who was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the adoption of the Confederate battle flag. He spoke earlier this year about his regrets about not getting involved in the civil rights movement as a young adult.\n\n\u201cAs a child and a teenager, I saw evidence of discrimination virtually every day,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cCertainly I feel like I should have stepped forward more and been a leader and a more positive force in the great events that were occurring.\u201d\n\nBut by the time Sessions was a top federal prosecutor, he apparently thought civil rights progress had gone far enough, as he explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986. Sessions had been asked to explain why he had reportedly used phrases like \u201cun-American\u201d to describe groups like the ACLU and NAACP.\n\n\u201cI made the comment that the fundamental legal barriers to minorities had been knocked down, and that in many areas blacks dominate the political area, and that when the civil rights organizations or the ACLU participate in asking for things beyond what they are justified in asking, they do more harm than good,\u201d Sessions testified.\n\nSessions\u2019 name has emerged as the Department of Justice begins working with the Trump transition team.", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/582e79ed180000ca0330ec68.jpeg?cache=i52gihhrj3", "title": "Trump Picks Jeff Sessions, Senator Accused Of Racism, For Attorney General", "summary": "\u201cThis means that he or she is also the chief protector of civil rights and civil liberties for everyone in our Nation.\n\u201cThe Attorney General serves as the chief law enforcement officer in the country.\nHe spoke earlier this year about his regrets about not getting involved in the civil rights movement as a young adult.\nThe Attorney General must be independent and fair.\nSessions, an early Trump backer, is an immigration hard-liner who has been in the Senate since 1997 and previously served as attorney general for the state of Alabama.", "source": "Huffington Post", "bias": "Bias: Left", "authors": ["Senior Justice Reporter The Huffington Post", "Christina Wilkie", "White House Reporter The Huffington Post", "Ryan J"], "keywords": ["enforcement", "attorney", "rights", "trump", "immigration", "sessions", "civil", "jeff", "racism", "picks", "senate", "accused", "senator", "general", "law"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-17 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/17/fed-still-likely-to-hike-interest-rates-in-december-despite-election-result/", "text": "\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board chair Janet Yellen testifies before a Congressional Joint Economic hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nThe Federal Reserve appears on track to raise interest rates in December, but its plans to continue a gradual tightening of monetary policy next year could shift depending on what policies President-elect Donald Trump and Congress pursue, Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen signaled on Thursday.\n\nIn remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, and under questioning from its members, Yellen gave several indications that the central bank is poised for a rate increase next month unless economic data quickly sour. Yellen also said \u201cIt is fully my intention to serve out my term,\u201d which ends in February of 2018, even though Trump criticized her frequently on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd she warned that the fiscal agenda that emerges under the incoming administration, which appears likely to include tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending, could change the Fed's calculus on how fast to continue raising rates.\n\n\u201cWe will be watching the decisions that Congress makes and updating our economic outlook\u201d as they begin to play out, Yellen said, under questioning. \u201cThings could turn out very differently, we understand.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets appeared largely unfazed by her comments, with stocks barely fluctuating. Bond yields continued to climb on new inflation data that showed consumer prices increased last month at their fastest pace since April.\n\nAnalysts have said that Trump's tax and spending plans, if enacted, could accelerate inflation, because unemployment has fallen below 5 percent and wages are growing at an increased rate. Yellen seemed to nod to those concerns, noting that the economy no longer needs the dose of fiscal stimulus that Fed officials called for in the wake of the Great Recession and urging lawmakers to keep America's long-run budget deficit concerns in mind.\n\nAsked if uncertainty over Trump's agenda warranted holding off on a December rate increase - which economists have long suggested, and which Fed officials have been foreshadowing for months - Yellen gave what amounts, in the guarded language of Fed chairs, to a fairly direct \"no\".\n\n\u201cMy guess is that uncertainty about these measures will last for some considerable time, and we have had an accommodative monetary policy\u2026for a long time,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI would think that the judgment that the committee reached in November remains the appropriate one.\"\n\nMost analysts read the Fed's November release as a sign that a rate increase was just around the corner. In her testimony, Yellen seemed to encourage that reading, telling the committee that Fed officials deemed this month \u201cthat the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.\u201d\n\nShe said growth and inflation appear to be gaining steam in the second half of the year, and she warned against waiting too long to begin raising rates again.\n\n\u201cWere the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long,\u201d Yellen said, \u201cit could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee\u2019s longer-run policy goals. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.\u201d\n\nWhat happens after the next rate hike could well hinge on Congress and Trump. The Fed has long suggested it would embark on a carefully planned series of moves to bring rates up from their historically low levels over the next few years. After a single and small increase last year, rates have remained just above zero throughout 2016. They have held off as they watched for even more evidence that the labor market is getting close to full employment and the inflation rate, which currently is running below the Fed's 2 percent target, is rising.\n\nIn her remarks, Yellen said the Fed, \u201ccontinues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time\u201d in order to reach full employment and not overshoot on inflation. She also said that \u201cWhile above-trend growth of the labor force and employment cannot continue indefinitely, there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market.\u201d\n\nAnalysts cautioned that Yellen may need to change her tune in short order, if Trump and Congress agree on a package of measures to stimulate the economy. \"At some point, particularly if a stronger pace of growth materializes in the back half of 2017 as we anticipate,\" researchers from Deutsche Bank said on Wednesday, \"the Fed may have to rethink this 'gradual' strategy.\"\n\nTaking questions from the House and Senate members on the committee, Yellen addressed two other possible consequences of the election.\n\nShe said she hoped the new administration would not roll back financial regulations put in place under the Dodd-Frank bill passed after the Great Recession. \u201cI certainly would not want to see all the improvements we have put in place, I would not want to see the clock turn back on those,\" she said, \"because I think they\u2019re important to reduce the odds of a future crisis.\u201d\n\nYellen also made a case for continued Fed independence, an issue that has bubbled up given Trump's criticism of the central bank and Yellen personally, and efforts in Congress to impose more oversight. \u201cWe\u2019ve really seen terrible economic outcomes in countries where central banks have been subject to political pressure,\u201d she said.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-11-17/Reuters/2016-11-17T162051Z_01_WAS512_RTRIDSP_3_USA-FED-YELLEN.jpg", "title": "Fed still likely to hike interest rates in December, despite election result", "summary": "\"Most analysts read the Fed's November release as a sign that a rate increase was just around the corner.\n\"Taking questions from the House and Senate members on the committee, Yellen addressed two other possible consequences of the election.\nThe Fed has long suggested it would embark on a carefully planned series of moves to bring rates up from their historically low levels over the next few years.\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board chair Janet Yellen testifies before a Congressional Joint Economic hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 17, 2016.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really seen terrible economic outcomes in countries where central banks have been subject to political pressure,\u201d she said.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley Covers Economic Policy For The Post He's Oregon He Misses It", "Robert Barnes"], "keywords": ["fed", "trump", "congress", "federal", "hike", "economic", "rate", "long", "increase", "likely", "inflation", "rates", "result", "interest", "despite", "yellen", "election"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-15 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/15/donald-trump-transition-team-disarray-adviser-purge", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s transition to the White House appeared to be in disarray on Tuesday after the abrupt departure of a top national security adviser and amid continuing questions over the role of his three children and son-in-law.\n\nFormer Republican congressman Mike Rogers stepped down from the president-elect\u2019s transition team without explanation, but one report attributed it to a \u201cStalinesque purge\u201d.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Trump attempted to paint a less chaotic picture, tweeting that the transition process was \u201cvery organized\u201d. He also wrote that only he knew who \u201cthe finalists\u201d were \u2013 seemingly an attempt to liken the process to his reality TV show The Apprentice.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\n\nA week after his election, Trump and vice-president-elect Mike Pence were huddled at Trump Tower in New York to work on key appointments as the US Senate was due to resume business in a still shellshocked Washington.\n\nRogers chaired the House intelligence committee and is a former army officer and FBI special agent. He said he was proud of the work his team had done to produce policy and personnel guidance \u201con the complex national security challenges facing our great country\u201d.\n\nLoyalists and rivals tipped for powerful roles in Trump's cabinet Read more\n\nThe departure offered the latest clue that the transition is going to be every bit as bumpy as feared. Last week the president-elect ditched the head of the team, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who is mired in political scandal, and replaced him with Pence.\n\nNBC News quoted a source as saying Rogers was the victim of a \u201cStalinesque purge\u201d of people close to Christie. \u201cTwo sources close to the situation described an atmosphere of sniping and backbiting as Trump loyalists position themselves for key jobs,\u201d the network reported.\n\nSome Republicans who previously ostracised Trump are returning to the fold but not always with success. Eliot Cohen, a senior state department official under George W Bush, launched a stinging attack on the transition effort. He tweeted:\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter exchange [with] Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They\u2019re angry, arrogant, screaming \u2018you LOST!\u2019 Will be ugly.\u201d\n\nA few days ago, Cohen had encouraged the suspicious Republican foreign policy establishment to rally around the president-elect.\n\nAdding to the sense of chaos, both the state department and Pentagon said they were yet to hear from the incoming administration, while rumours swirled over whether Trump\u2019s children \u2013 Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner \u2013 would seek top security clearances. Kushner was said to have been instrumental in the departures of Christie and Rogers.\n\nBarack Obama told reporters at the White House on Monday that he believed Trump was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, and reiterated his commitment to a smooth handover. But the Associated Press reported that coordination between Trump\u2019s transition team and White House staff is on hold until Trump\u2019s team signs a memorandum of understanding.\n\nSpeculation over cabinet appointments intensified on Tuesday. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and former Republican candidate for president tipped to be health secretary, has dropped out of the running. \u201cI want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area,\u201d Carson, who is Trump\u2019s most prominent African American supporter, told the Washington Post.\n\nThe New York Times reported that former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, an old friend of Trump, is the frontrunner for the prize job of secretary of state. He has no foreign policy experience beyond strong advocacy for the war on terror following the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, which gave him global prominence.\n\nSamantha Bee on Trump's cabinet list: 'Deplorables, zealots and extremists' Read more\n\nBut the political action committee Correct the Record argued that Giuliani, 72, had a \u201clong history of business ties to enemies of America\u201d. He was reportedly paid to advocate on behalf of an Iranian dissident group while it was listed by the state department as a foreign terrorist organisation and worked for a law firm whose clients included Saddam Hussein, terrorist Abu Nidal and an oil company controlled by the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. All these are potential red flags if he goes before the Senate for confirmation.\n\nTrump\u2019s children will take over the running of his business while he is in the White House, raising the prospect of a conflict of interest. Responding to claims that they are already exploiting his new status for commercial ends, the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted: \u201cFree advice: Stop it. Don\u2019t do this. The presidency is bigger than the family business. Just stop it.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump, a tycoon, reality TV star and political novice, has a long history of pitting rivals against one another, both in business and during his election campaign. He has appointed Steve Bannon as chief strategist and Reince Priebus as chief of staff, an unprecedented arrangement that threatens to create competing centers of power.\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of Bannon, executive chairman of the far-right Breitbart News, provoked a furious backlash from progressives. The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said: \u201cThere must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nDeparting US Senate minority leader Harry Reid on Tuesday called on the president to rescind Bannon\u2019s appointment, which he said has only \u201cdeepened\u201d the country\u2019s divisions since the election.\n\n\u201cBy placing a champion of white supremacists a step away from the Oval Office, what message does Trump send to the young girl who woke up Wednesday morning in Rhode Island afraid to be a woman of color in America?\u201d Reid said, speaking on the Senate floor.\n\nReid had previously lashed out at the businessman in a powerful statement last week that referred to the president-elect as \u201ca sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate\u201d.\n\nIn response to his criticism, Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and current transition team adviser, appeared to threaten legal action against Reid and warned that the Democrat should be \u201cvery careful\u201d in his criticism of the president-elect.\n\n\n\nBut on Tuesday Paul Ryan, the House speaker who is attempting to overcome past disagreements with Trump, refused to condemn the appointment. \u201cThe president is going to be judged on his results,\u201d he told reporters. \u201c[Bannon] is a person who helped him win an incredible victory and an incredible campaign.\n\nRyan promised that Trump and a unified Republican Congress would mean that \u201ca better way, better days lie ahead for our country\u201d. He pledged to work \u201chand in glove\u201d with the incoming administration.\n\nThe House speaker was on course to be re-elected by Republicans on Tuesday afternoon but House Democrats postponed leadership elections that had been scheduled for Thursday until 30 November amid signs of discontent with Pelosi.\n\nOngoing vote counts show Democrat Hillary Clinton pulling away from Trump in the popular vote, although he won the electoral college vote. Trump tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cIf the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in NY, Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily.\u201d\n\nDespite previously labelling the electoral college a \u201cdisaster\u201d, he tweeted that it was \u201cactually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s inauguration will take place in Washington on 20 January.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Gambino", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062f129e5af8be9ec8a70ed2167b01f340646b0a/0_38_3426_2056/master/3426.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=09fa06f298208d71eaccf9070afe939a", "title": "Trump transition team in disarray after top adviser 'purged'", "summary": "But the Associated Press reported that coordination between Trump\u2019s transition team and White House staff is on hold until Trump\u2019s team signs a memorandum of understanding.\nHe tweeted:\u201cAfter exchange [with] Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away.\nFormer Republican congressman Mike Rogers stepped down from the president-elect\u2019s transition team without explanation, but one report attributed it to a \u201cStalinesque purge\u201d.\nDonald Trump\u2019s transition to the White House appeared to be in disarray on Tuesday after the abrupt departure of a top national security adviser and amid continuing questions over the role of his three children and son-in-law.\nLate on Tuesday, Trump attempted to paint a less chaotic picture, tweeting that the transition process was \u201cvery organized\u201d.", "source": "The Guardian", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["David Smith"], "keywords": ["adviser", "transition", "trump", "business", "house", "disarray", "state", "trumps", "team", "vote", "white", "work", "purged"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "None", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trumps-first-ambassador-barack-obama-231393", "text": "Trump\u2019s first ambassador: Barack Obama On his last foreign trip as president, the task ahead of Obama is enormous: Reassuring the world about a successor he said couldn\u2019t possibly win.\n\nATHENS \u2014 There was a time, a week ago, when the Obama White House was focused on questions like who would take over tending to the first lady's vegetable garden.\n\nNow President Barack Obama is setting out on what was supposed to be a fun post-election farewell trip to Greece and Germany with not just his entire domestic record at risk of being gutted by President-elect Donald Trump, but transatlantic new order he cultivated is in the midst of being rejected. His failure to convince people against Brexit no longer looks like a fluke: British voters recoiled at his campaigning for Remain in the spring, and last week, many from his own coalition of voters weren\u2019t compelled by his warnings that Trump would be a threat to all the progress his administration had made and to the safety of the world.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd he\u2019s going to explain to all the world leaders he meets \u2014 he\u2019ll gather with his European counterparts in Berlin on Friday and then with the Chinese and other Asia-Pacific leaders in his stop in Peru over the weekend \u2014 why he got the election so wrong, after assuring them all year that they need not be too worried about Trump winning, or even his brand of politics much influencing the future of American foreign policy. Then he\u2019s going to tell them to trust him this time on his promises and assessments of where things will go now that Trump did what he assured them couldn\u2019t happen.\n\nOnly minutes after Trump finished a friendly phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, it fell to Obama to reassure the world that America\u2019s foreign policy actually wouldn\u2019t change much \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t even be made solely by the man who has questioned nearly everything about how the U.S. does business abroad, from support for free trade to opposition to nuclear proliferation to treaty-level commitments to allies.\n\n\u201cOne of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the president obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the commander-in-chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the president, it is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries, and our diplomats and other diplomats, the intelligence officers and development workers,\u201d Obama said at his pre-trip press conference at the White House on Monday.\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue.\u201d\n\nAhead of the election, White House aides struggled to give good reasons for why Obama was headed to Greece. Now going looks more quaint, a bit of closing presidential tourism meant to congratulate the Greek people on coming through the turmoil of their economic collapse and ongoing refugee crisis \u2014 a planned message that perhaps didn't fully account for how this small Mediterranean country\u2019s collapse seems to have shaken the very idea of globalism.\n\nObama was going to Berlin to buck up his friend and spirit sister Angela Merkel against the domestic political backlash she\u2019s facing. He\u2019s arriving with Merkel looking like the last bulwark of Western liberal values, a leader who could be headed for an unexpected fall of her own without anything he or anyone else can do about it.\n\nAlternatively, some believe, Germany and Europe overall is where Obamaism will hibernate to wait out 2020, much like they felt happened during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency \u2014 when Obama looked like such a welcome restoration to their sense of America that he won the Nobel Peace Prize just for getting elected.\n\nObama remains hugely popular on the continent, and the fears sparked by Trump's election, intense in Germany, seem to be reminding Europeans of that. Trump has emboldened the European nationalist right, but his victory has also woken up the left and center to how real, and how existential a moment the world is in.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of great change in the world, but America's always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe and that's what it must continue to be,\u201d Obama added at the press conference.\n\nObama said he was impressed by how much Trump seemed to agree with him on foreign policy during their 90-minute meeting in the Oval Office last week.\n\nTrump has not signaled any of that supposed alignment himself.\n\nDuring the campaign, Hillary Clinton accused Trump of being a puppet of Moscow and Obama made a similar case. Trump repeatedly said that Putin was a stronger leader than Obama who needs to be treated with more respect. On that point, the president-elect appears to be sticking to what he said \u2014 at least according to the Kremlin.\n\nPutin\u2019s government put out a statement on his call with Trump, during which according to the they \u201cnot only agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations but also expressed support for active joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues\u201d\u2014words likely to set off a panic in many Eastern European capitals.\n\nAnd, in a signal that the Kremlin expects the sanctions enacted after Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea to disappear, the statement added: \u201cThey emphasized the importance of establishing a reliable foundation for bilateral ties by developing the trade and economic component.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s transition team gave only a cursory account of this call, and made no apparent effort to correct or amend Russia\u2019s version of the conversation.\n\nA revamped relationship with Russia could lead to inviting Putin to rejoin the group of leading nations to make the G7 into the G8 again, reversing the decision that booted Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the very least, the next G7 meeting scheduled for May in Sicily is going to look very different from the one Obama attended in Japan this past spring. Other than Merkel, who\u2019s up next October, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose election last October represented to many of the president\u2019s supporters the ascent of an Obama-generation progressive, could be the only familiar face left. Obama's compatriot David Cameron has already been replaced by Theresa May in the U.K. Italian Prime Minister Mateo Renzi, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the president hosted for his final state dinner last month, faces an anti-European Union referendum next month that may force him to resign. Marine Le Pen feels empowered ahead of France\u2019s presidential election next April. And Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2014 who is rushing to New York this week to meet Trump \u2014 faces his own internal turmoil from some of his turns to the west, including sticking his neck out for the now-dead Trans Pacific Partnership, on top of Japan\u2019s always volatile domestic politics.\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama will give a big speech here in the Greek capital that was always meant to be about the future of globalism, said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes last week. That speech hadn't been written before the election results, he noted, so the text hasn't had to be torn up \u2014 but obviously, it's needing to be rethought.\n\n\"Look, there are certain things that have endured for decades under administrations of different parties,\" Rhodes said, holding to assumptions that Trump insisted throughout the campaign he would challenge if elected.\n\n\"The transatlantic alliance is certainly one of those. The NATO alliance is certainly one of those. We have taken steps during our time in office to reinforce the NATO alliance, to reassure Eastern European allies, to move significant military personnel and equipment to our eastern flank to ensure that those nations are reassured, and also to work with NATO on counterterrorism and deal with refugee flows.\"\n\n", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201611/764/1155968404_5210172655001_5210130504001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "title": "Trump\u2019s first ambassador: Barack Obama", "summary": "Trump\u2019s first ambassador: Barack Obama On his last foreign trip as president, the task ahead of Obama is enormous: Reassuring the world about a successor he said couldn\u2019t possibly win.\nThat will continue.\u201dAhead of the election, White House aides struggled to give good reasons for why Obama was headed to Greece.\nATHENS \u2014 There was a time, a week ago, when the Obama White House was focused on questions like who would take over tending to the first lady's vegetable garden.\nObama remains hugely popular on the continent, and the fears sparked by Trump's election, intense in Germany, seem to be reminding Europeans of that.\nObama was going to Berlin to buck up his friend and spirit sister Angela Merkel against the domestic political backlash she\u2019s facing.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Edward-isaac Dovere", "Gabriel Debenedetti"], "keywords": ["week", "ambassador", "trump", "election", "foreign", "barack", "going", "trumps", "president", "world", "white", "european", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-13 17:18:08-05:00", "url": "http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2016/november/donald-trump-names-reince-priebus-as-chief-of-staff", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus his new chief of staff.\n\nHe also named conservative media executive Stephen K.

Meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he looked forward \u201cto dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.\u201d A day later, in interviews with The Wall Street Journal and \u201c60 Minutes,\u2019\u2019 he said he had decided to retain elements of Mr. Obama\u2019s landmark health care law after their conversation \u2014 a hint, at least, that he might govern less radically than he had campaigned.\n\nWhite House officials expressed hope that Mr. Obama would be able to impress on Mr. Trump the importance of other parts of his legacy, like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. The two will have the kind of peer-to-peer relationship that only fellow presidents can have \u2014 something that administration officials hope will appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s pride, as well as his desire to succeed, and make him view Mr. Obama less as a rival.\n\nThey conceded, though, that there was little historical precedent for such a relationship, especially when the incoming president had ousted the incumbent\u2019s party after such an acrid campaign, and that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama were never likely to become buddies.\n\nMr. Trump is drawing mainly from a pool of trusted aides and supporters, according to people familiar with the campaign. On Friday, he named three of his grown children \u2014 Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to his transition team, an arrangement that rang alarm bells in Washington because they will also manage his businesses. The Trump family, it is clear, will wield unusual power in the composition of an administration that is already shaping up as remarkable for its clannishness.\n\nEven within Mr. Trump\u2019s tight circle, however, there are sharp differences in ideology, background and temperament that could play out in how the White House deals with Congress and how the United States deals with the rest of the world.\n\nPerhaps the deepest schism is between Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and media entrepreneur who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman who came to terms with Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Both are on a short list for chief of staff, according to people close to the campaign, and whoever is chosen, the other is likely to get another senior White House post.\n\nEach would bring a radically different approach to a job often called the second-most powerful in Washington \u2014 gatekeeper to the president and often the first and last person he sees in the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Bannon, the executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News and onetime Goldman Sachs executive, is an avowed enemy of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. An anti-establishment verbal bomb thrower with ties to the alt-right movement, Mr. Bannon may have little interest in compromising with the Republican-controlled Congress under its current leadership. He is an unabashed critic of the current immigration system and repeatedly encouraged Mr. Trump to appeal to the party\u2019s base in the closing days of the campaign with arguments against globalization.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Priebus, a party loyalist who tried to reconcile Republican leaders with their renegade nominee, would most likely build bridges to Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders. A Washington insider with a reputation for being easy to work with, Mr. Priebus would operate a more traditional White House, though given Mr. Trump\u2019s flamboyant personality, traditional is a relative term.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus are proxies for the larger battle over what kind of president Mr. Trump will be. Some former Republican officials held out hope that Mr. Trump would be receptive to moderating influences, but others worried that he would simply listen to the last person he spoke to.\n\n\u201cYou always have that tension between what he said to get elected and what he actually believes,\u201d said John D. Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush. \u201cHow selective will his amnesia be?\u201d\n\nMr. Negroponte, a Republican who supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign, said he could imagine senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council warning him about the dangers of \u201ccutting loose countries from our nuclear umbrella,\u201d which Mr. Trump threatened during the campaign to do in reference to Japan and South Korea.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired career intelligence officer who is Mr. Trump\u2019s closest foreign-policy adviser, is a candidate for national security adviser, according to an internal transition document obtained by the conservative news site The Daily Caller, as is Stephen J. Hadley, who served in that capacity for Mr. Bush.\n\nMr. Hadley, who might also be considered for defense secretary, pushed Mr. Bush to undertake the troop surge in Iraq and is closely identified with the military interventionism of that administration. A key figure in the Republican foreign-policy establishment, Mr. Hadley had a hand in Mr. Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, in which he called for the United States to be an evangelist in spreading democracy \u2014 something Mr. Trump has flatly rejected.\n\nGeneral Flynn, a registered Democrat, has criticized the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration for leading the United States into quagmires like Iraq. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten us into mess after mess for the wrong reasons,\u201d he said, echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh criticism of Mr. Bush during the Republican debates. And like Mr. Trump, General Flynn is withering about the foreign-policy establishment of both parties.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive for Mr. Trump to recruit a Bush administration veteran. But Peter D. Feaver, who worked on President Bush\u2019s national security council and now teaches at Duke University, pointed out that Mr. Obama had campaigned \u201cvociferously against the Iraq surge, and then asked the architect of the surge\u201d \u2014 Robert M. Gates \u2014 \u201cto stay.\u201d Mr. Gates, as defense secretary, later persuaded Mr. Obama to deploy a similar surge in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cYou can say one thing in campaigns, and mean it,\u201d Mr. Feaver said, \u201cand in personnel matters, do the opposite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe contest for top economic posts does not expose the same ideological fault lines as those for the White House or national security jobs. But it does raise red flags, given the anti-establishment, anti-Wall Street sentiment that Mr. Trump stoked during the campaign.\n\nSeveral of the candidates on his short list for Treasury secretary come from Wall Street, including Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was the finance chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. People close to Mr. Dimon said he was not interested in the job.\n\nAnother candidate is a conservative Texas congressman, Jeb Hensarling, who has called for the repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, the banking regulations passed after the financial crisis, during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe least predictable source of influence on Mr. Trump remains Mr. Obama. For all their differences, and the bitter words they flung at each other during the campaign, the two share traits. Both won the presidency as outsiders, and both hold their party\u2019s foreign-policy establishment in contempt.\n\nWith Mr. Trump lacking elective-office experience or the political coterie that accompanies establishment candidates to Washington, administration officials said Mr. Obama would probably spend more time with him than was typical for other incoming and outgoing presidents.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump, some outsiders predicted, would respect the advice of a president 15 years younger, whose path to the White House was nearly as improbable as his.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at things from a hiring point of view, as Trump does, Obama could have done anything he wanted,\u201d Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, said in reference to Mr. Obama\u2019s career options. \u201cThat has to impress Trump.\u201d", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/us/13trumpadviser/13trumpadviser-web01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019s Hires Will Set Course of His Presidency", "summary": "PhotoIn some ways, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus are proxies for the larger battle over what kind of president Mr. Trump will be.\nThe least predictable source of influence on Mr. Trump remains Mr. Obama.\nPerhaps the deepest schism is between Stephen K.

This week we've seen just how quickly the conventional wisdom can see-saw: After a year of editorials about the decimated state of the GOP, suddenly we've started seeing takes like this:\n\nAnd this:\n\nAnd you can see why! The Republicans now control Congress, the White House, and a majority of state governments, and they are about to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court. The Democrats' political operation has turned out to be as hollow as a triple-A rating from Moody's in 2006. As the old clich\u00e9 goes, the Dems are in disarray.\n\nBut so are the Republicans. Donald Trump won the GOP nomination because the party had slipped from its gatekeepers' grasp, and he broke with normal political behavior by continuing to blast away at his Republican rivals even after accepting the nomination. It wouldn't be true to say that he owes nothing to the party establishment\u2014the RNC certainly gave him crucial on-the-ground assistance at the end of the campaign\u2014but he won the election on his own terms and clearly doesn't feel obliged to pay obeisance to anyone. He could conceivably decide to focus on the issues that interest him and let the usual Republican suspects set the agenda for everything else; he could just as conceivably treat Paul Ryan (or Ryan's successor) as the head of another opposition party.\n\nAnd Trump himself is vulnerable to the same sort of storm that propelled him into office. You younger readers may not know this, but in the long-ago days of 2015 Ted Cruz was seen as a bomb-throwing radical challenging the centers of Republican power. Now the GOP grassroots write him off as a Goldman Sachs puppet who tried to derail the Trump Train. If Cruz and other onetime Tea Party insurgents are already being decried as an old order to be blown aside, Trump may someday find himself in the crosshairs too. Live by the uprising, die by the uprising.\n\nSo the Republicans clearly have the upper hand in government, but the Republican Party remains weak, in the sense of not having an orderly, hierarchical structure that can keep everyone in line. The Democratic Party looks pretty weak too\u2014and now that Trump has shown how much of a paper tiger a party's gatekeepers can be, it's entirely possible that a Trump figure will soon arise on the Dems' side of the aisle as well.\n\nThese aren't predictions, mind you. Trump could face an insurgency, or he could remake the party in his image. The Democrats could find themselves nominating Bernie Sanders or Kanye West or a sentient Facebook meme, or they could clear the way for yet another grey old pol from the club. The point is how fragile those edifices of party power are, and how much uncertainty that entails. (And how much pure contingency too. If this election had been held a month earlier, maybe Hillary Clinton would be president-elect and the Republicans would be getting bombarded with these your-party-is-a-goner analyses.)\n\nPerhaps this is the kind of unstable situation that just isn't tenable, and the two-party system will eventually break down. You can certainly see signs of dissatisfaction with it: record numbers of people identifying as independents, the strongest third-party results in 20 years, the very fact that a former independent with no institutional loyalty to the GOP can sweep in to take the Republican nomination and then the presidency. If more jurisdictions follow Maine's lead and adopt more pluralistic voting systems, we might finally get a party system that doesn't try to squeeze everybody into just two categories.\n\nOr maybe not. Maine's new ranked-voting system looks attractive, but Maine is just one state. The rest of us still have a first-past-the-post system that seems to gravitate naturally toward a two-party setup whether or not those parties are institutionally strong. There's a lot of churning in the history of American politics.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said he and successor-in-waiting Donald Trump had an \"excellent conversation\" Thursday as the intense rivals who defined the volatile 2016 election discussed the hand-off of the White House.\n\nJust days after vicious attacks on the campaign trail, the two men spoke well of each other and shook hands for the cameras. Trump, who famously challenged the president's place of birth, called his predecessor \"a very good man\" following their Oval Office meeting.\n\nObama said his \"number one priority\" in the next two months in office is to facilitate the transition to the Trump administration. He said the two talked about \"organizational issues,\" as well as domestic and foreign policies. \"I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face,\" Obama told reporters.\n\nIn pledging a smooth transition, Obama told Trump that \"we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed \u2014 because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\"\n\nTrump \u2014 noting that the meeting ran long \u2014 said: \"Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future.\"\n\nThe New York businessman also said: \"We had never met each other. I have great respect.\"\n\nThe two shook hands for the cameras, but did not take questions from reporters.\n\nHeading into the meeting, Obama and Trump struck conciliatory notes in the wake of Tuesday's surprising election results, following a campaign of searing rhetoric.\n\n\"It's time for America to bind the wounds of division,\" Trump said during his victory speech early Wednesday.\n\nObama is \"quite sincere about fulfilling the basic responsibility that he has to the American people and our democracy to ensure a smooth transition to the next presidency,\" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nAfter the meeting, Earnest said the two leaders did not resolve all of their differences, but did not try to either; their focus was a smooth transition.\n\nTrump followed up the meeting by heading to Capitol Hill to meet with another key player in his emerging presidency, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. The vice president-elect, Mike Pence, also attended the session with Ryan, who, like Obama, has had his share of differences with Trump. Afterward, Ryan said that \"we had a fantastic, productive meeting about getting to work.\"\n\nThe president-elect also met with another powerful Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, wife Melania and Vice President-elect Mike Pence pose for photographers with House Speaker Paul Ryan after a meeting in the Speaker's office on Nov. 10, 2016. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\nAsked about his talks with lawmakers, Trump told reporters: \"We have a lot to do. We're going to work very strongly on immigration, health care and we're looking at jobs, big league jobs.\"\n\nGearing up for his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump is also starting to speak on the phone with an array of leaders from across the globe, from Japan to Turkey. British Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated Trump on his victory, and reminded the New York businessman of his \"commitment in his acceptance speech to uniting people across America, which she said is a task we all need to focus on globally,\" according to a statement from May's office.\n\nTrump invited May to visit him as soon as possible, the statement said.\n\nAnother world leader, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced his government is prepared to re-negotiate parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada. During his campaign, Trump said existing free trade deals have shipped overseas.\n\nThe Trump team is also putting together possible picks for the Cabinet and White House staff.\n\nWhile Obama and Trump spoke in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama gave a tour of the residence to Melania Trump. During the campaign, Mrs. Obama criticized Trump over his lewd comments about women. Mrs. Trump, during her address to the Republican national convention, used lines cribbed from a speech the first lady had once given.\n\nIn preparing for his sit-down with Trump, the president said \"it is no secret\" that they have \"some pretty significant differences.\" But the president added that he'd also had differences with his predecessor, George W. Bush, and they had a smooth transition. He said he has instructed aides to \"follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect.\"\n\nPeople gather outside the West Wing of the White House in on Nov. 10, 2016, as they wait for the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nOne Trump backer and Obama critic, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, described the meeting between the president and his successor as \"an amazing tribute to the power of the people.\"\n\nTrump spent much of his insurgent campaign pledging to reverse and tear down Obama's legacy. He called for repealing and replacing the president's health care law, voiding the Iran nuclear deal and ripping up new business and environmental regulations.\n\nOn the stump, Trump also criticized Obama for campaigning so much on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying he should \"do the job he's supposed to be doing.\"\n\nIn his campaign speeches, Obama cast Trump as an erratic and perhaps unstable political novice who shouldn't be allowed near the nuclear codes. \"It's really bad being arrogant when you don't know what you're talking about,\" Obama said.\n\nThe Obama-Trump rivalry, intrinsic to the 2016 election, goes back years.\n\nDuring Obama's first term, Trump made a name for himself by becoming the de facto leader of the so-called \"birther\" movement, pushing the false idea that the president was not born in the United States. In this past campaign year, Clinton described the birther movement as a racist attack on the nation's first African-American president.\n\nIn 2011, Obama responded by producing a long-form birth certificate and mocking Trump at a high-profile press dinner as the New York businessman sat in the audience.\n\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Obama said he wants to make sure the presidential succession is \"well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fFezXO", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d0ab012439de6b1f0af167da37c409ea39ecd115/c=0-371-3383-2282&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/11/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636143790458975542-AP-APTOPIX-Obama-Trump.jpg", "title": "Obama says he and Trump had 'excellent conversation'", "summary": "While Obama and Trump spoke in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama gave a tour of the residence to Melania Trump.\n(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said he and successor-in-waiting Donald Trump had an \"excellent conversation\" Thursday as the intense rivals who defined the volatile 2016 election discussed the hand-off of the White House.\nHeading into the meeting, Obama and Trump struck conciliatory notes in the wake of Tuesday's surprising election results, following a campaign of searing rhetoric.\nTrump, who famously challenged the president's place of birth, called his predecessor \"a very good man\" following their Oval Office meeting.\nUSA TODAY NETWORKPresident Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Nov. 10, 2016.", "source": "USA Today", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Published A M Et Nov"], "keywords": ["trump", "campaign", "house", "office", "transition", "conversation", "excellent", "president", "white", "presidentelect", "meeting", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-10 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/election-results-reaction-streets/index.html", "text": "(CNN) For many Americans across the country, Donald Trump's victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept.\n\n\"Not my president,\" protesters chanted in rallies coast to coast.\n\nTens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight -- with demonstrations outside Trump's properties.\n\nWhile most protesters were peaceful, dozens were arrested.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nUPDATE: This post from shortly after the November election has been updated to reflect accuracy of polls after states certified their vote counts. National polls were more accurate than they appeared immediately after the election, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s two percentage-point advantage in the popular vote was similar to her three-point lead in an average of polls. The final results indicate state poll averages were slightly more accurate than in preliminary data, though there was a clear tendency to underestimate Donald Trump\u2019s standing against Clinton.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s poll and forecast-defying victory Tuesday immediately raised criticisms of a crisis in public opinion polling, with CNN anchor Jake Tapper saying the result would put the polling and voter projection industry \u201cout of business.\u201d\n\nElection pollsters have already been under scrutiny after high-profile polling mishaps around the world, from the close Brexit vote earlier this year to the defeat Colombia's referendum making peace with FARC rebels. In the United States, Hillary Clinton's surprise victory in the 2008 Democratic New Hampshire presidential primary prompted a comprehensive report on potential causes of the errors in by the American Association for Public Opinion Research.\n\nSurvey researchers expressed varying levels of concern Wednesday about the significance of polling inaccuracies and theories on the causes. \u201cThe final high quality scientific RDD landline/cell-phone national polls consistently overestimated Clinton\u2019s share of the vote by 3 or 4 percentage points,\u201d Jon Krosnick said in an email. Krosnick is a professor of political science at Stanford University and a widely respected expert on survey methods. \u201cThat\u2019s a systematic error but not huge.\u201d (Update: Final vote counts show the average of national polls overestimated Clinton\u2019s share of the two-party vote by about one percentage point.)\n\nKrosnick said he was not surprised by the inaccuracy of state polls, reasoning that \u201cmost state polls are not scientific \u2014 either they involve volunteer respondents instead of randomly sampled respondents, or they involve automated calling to landlines only, omitted cell phone only people.\u201d\n\nMonmouth University pollster Patrick Murray expressed greater concern about the way polls missed Trump\u2019s support. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant anti-establishment mood that polls didn\u2019t catch \u2014 it caught some of it but not all of it,\u201d Murray said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWe might come to a conclusion that polls lose their precise predictive power and are best as general gauges of the mood of the electorate instead of predicting electoral outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe causes of polling errors are typically hazy in the immediate wake of election results, due in no small part to votes continuing to be tallied well after Election Day. But even with incomplete data, it\u2019s worth assessing how much polls differed from results and why they led to a surprising result.\n\nAn analysis of 145 polls nationally and in 16 states completed within one week of the election shows a number of interesting results. The magnitude of national and state survey errors was not far from historical levels; the more troublesome dynamic was that errors systematically overestimated Clinton\u2019s vote margin against Trump, leading to parallel errors that did not catch a number of key states moving into Trump\u2019s column.\n\nClinton won the national popular vote by two percentage points according to certified vote tallies compiled by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. Most individual surveys found Clinton holding a small single-digit edge over Trump, averaging to a three-point margin. Looking across individual national polls, the average difference from the final Clinton-Trump vote margin is 2.2 percentage points, much smaller than the level of error apparent when they were compared to preliminary vote results (3.4 points).\n\nThe National Council on Public Polls (NCPP for short) has analyzed the accuracy of national surveys dating back to the 1930s, using a metric called \u201ccandidate error,\u201d which is the difference between the winning candidate\u2019s margin over the losing candidate minus a poll\u2019s margin, then divided by two.\n\nThe average candidate error in national polls for 2016 is 1.1, slightly lower than in 2012 (1.5) and just slightly higher than 2008 and 2004 (0.9 each) The overall size of errors this year is just below the average since 1992 (1.3) and about half the all-time average of 2.2. National poll error in the infamous 1948 election polls was nearly five times as large as 2016 (5 points).\n\nThe current estimate of candidate error in national polls is 1.7 (half of 3.4 above), slightly higher than 2012 and clearly larger than 2008 (0.9). The overall size of errors this year is a bit higher than the 1.3 average since the 1990s but below the all-time average of 2.2 and spikes in the early years, including a 5-point error in the infamous 1948 election.\n\nOne important caveat to this is that there are multiple different measures of polling accuracy \u2014 some focus on absolute estimates in support while others focus on the margin between candidates \u2014 and trends among these measures can yield varying conclusions. A different measure of national polling errors based on the difference in candidate\u2019s estimated support and their vote share finds an average difference of between 2.9 and 3.3, with smaller errors for results that left third party candidates out.\n\nSurveys across 17 states, including key battlegrounds, found a higher error of 1.7 using the candidate error metric, which is similar to the level of error found in all state-level surveys in 2004 (1.7), 2008 (1.8) and 2012 (1.9).\n\nWhile the absolute size of most errors was far from unusual, the state-by-state results show how polling systematically showed a better picture for Clinton before Election Day. The largest consequential swing from pre-election polls to results was in Wisconsin, where Clinton averaged a six-point edge in the final week but lost the state, trailing by one-point in current tallies.\n\nTrump won in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida despite polls showing Clinton ahead by narrow margins (especially in Florida). He won by a four-point margin in North Carolina, which appeared even in final pre-election polls, and far exceeded his slight advantages in Ohio and Iowa pre-election polls, winning both states comfortably.\n\n\n\nFinal week polls tracked by Huffington Post and RealClearPolitics. Certified vote results reported by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.\n\nLooking across all these states, Trump\u2019s polling margin was three percentage points better than pre-election polls estimated. What\u2019s striking is that many of these surveys did not miss by much \u2014 a majority came within four percentage points of the final vote margin. Yet while 52 showed Clinton faring at least four points better than the final margin, only three surveys showed Trump outperforming his final margin by that much.\n\nMany of these two-plus differences are small enough to fall within the margin of sampling error, though taken in the aggregate they show a consistent bias. A similar dynamic occurred four years ago, with surveys underestimating Barack Obama\u2019s margin of victory.\n\nIf only sampling error were at play, errors should be evenly scattered around population target. Assumptions of sampling error only apply to probability samples in the mix, of course, and the pattern of results suggests other types of error are at play.\n\nKrosnick, of Stanford, suggested the answer may lie in how pollsters select likely voters and handle respondents who are less certain to vote.\n\n\u201cI hope those pollsters enlist teams of experts to work with them to try to figure out what happened,\u201d said Krosnick, suggesting such teams stitch together large numbers to make estimates of small geographic areas that can be compared to election returns. \u201cBut regardless, that result in itself is not a reason to claim pollsters face a crisis.\u201d\n\nBoth Krosnick and Monmouth\u2019s Murray suggested exploring potential biases due to survey refusals and social desirability, such as respondents concealing their true vote preference to avoid potentially offending an interviewer. Research during the election season found mixed evidence for this, but there have been limited public examinations during the campaign.\n\n\u201cThere might be a certain segment of the population that was not going to talk to a pollster,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThey were going to prove us all wrong.\u201d\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nGraphic: Where the polls got it wrong\n\nOne unusual election doesn\u2019t disprove everything we know about campaigns\n\nWhy polling faces a moment of reckoning after the 2016 election", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2016/11/wclement2300.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "title": "The 2016 national polls are looking less wrong after final election tallies", "summary": "Yet while 52 showed Clinton faring at least four points better than the final margin, only three surveys showed Trump outperforming his final margin by that much.\nNational poll error in the infamous 1948 election polls was nearly five times as large as 2016 (5 points).\nWhat\u2019s striking is that many of these surveys did not miss by much \u2014 a majority came within four percentage points of the final vote margin.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a systematic error but not huge.\u201d (Update: Final vote counts show the average of national polls overestimated Clinton\u2019s share of the two-party vote by about one percentage point.\nLooking across all these states, Trump\u2019s polling margin was three percentage points better than pre-election polls estimated.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Scott Clement Is The Polling Manager At The Washington Post Specializing In Public Opinion About Politics Election Campaigns Public Policy"], "keywords": ["errors", "tallies", "national", "polls", "results", "looking", "wrong", "election", "polling", "error", "vote", "2016", "margin", "final"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-09 19:24:39-08:00", "url": "http://www.allsides.com/blog/online-news-sites-announce-trump-victory-excitement-or-horror", "text": "While there is some nice coverage about how print newspapers are covering the election results on their front pages - see Newspaper front pages cover Trump's victory \u2013 in pictures, we should also look at how it is being covered online.

Heading into Election Day, Clinton had seemed poised to finally break what she kept calling that \"highest, hardest glass ceiling.\" By the wee hours of Wednesday morning, it had become even more likely that Trump was about to make history instead.\n\nThere is no underestimating the seismic shock of a Trump victory, or the sickening feeling it engenders in scores of millions of Americans. For scores of millions of other Americans, a Clinton victory would be just as nauseating. This election, the most polarizing and anguish-filled in memory, was always destined to end with an immense swath of the nation horrified by the outcome.

We got through them all without turning into a dictatorship. We'll get through the administration of the 45th president.\n\nIt would take an across-the-board abdication of entrenched constitutional prerogatives for any American president, even the most popular and brilliant, to establish a dictatorship. Fortunately, the next president, far from popular, will be one of the least liked, least trusted ever. That portends a presidency on a very short leash: no long honeymoon, no compelling mandate. Indeed, the inauguration of a president so loathed by so many may offer the chance to finally peel away some of the imperial trappings of the modern presidency.\n\nElection 2016 ends with a wretched president-elect.

She smiled and declared, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d to those who cheered her.\n\n\u201cLast night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome that we wanted or worked so hard for, and I\u2019m sorry that we did not win this election\u2026. But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together. This vast, diverse, creative, unruly and energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.\u201d\n\nFighting back tears at times, Clinton acknowledged the crowd\u2019s disappointment, saying she \u2014 \u201cand tens of millions of Americans\u201d \u2014 felt it, too.\n\n\u201cThis is painful, and it will be for a long time,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America, and I always will.\u201d\n\nClinton also addressed those across the country who had supported her, describing her volunteers as \u201cthe best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted\u201d \u2014 and even seemed to give an unspoken shout-out to \u201cPantsuit Nation,\u201d a no-longer-secret Facebook group for Clinton\u2019s biggest fans.\n\n\u201cAnd to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook \u2014 even in secret private Facebook sites,\u201d she said to laughter. \u201cI want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward.\u201d\n\nClinton encouraged those watching to not be discouraged, particularly \u201cyoung people\u201d who might be at the beginning of their careers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had successes and I\u2019ve had setbacks,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou will have setbacks, too. This loss hurts. But please, never stop believing that fighting for what\u2019s right is worth it. It is. It is worth it.\u201d\n\nClinton and former president Bill Clinton both wore the color purple. Their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, looked on as her mother thanked their extended family for campaigning fervently on her behalf.\n\n\u201cTo all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,\u201d Hillary Clinton said. \u201cI know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. \u2026 And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.\u201d\n\nClinton closed by calling on those to continue fighting for the country and saying that she believed in its future.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI count my blessings every single day that I am an American and I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength for our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. Because you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that.\u201d\n\nAn emotional Kaine spoke first, saying he and his wife remain proud of Clinton.\n\n\u201cShe has been and is a great history maker in everything she has done,\u201d Kaine said, adding that she had blazed trails \u201cin a nation that is good at so many things but has made it uniquely difficult for a woman to be elected to federal office.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019m proud of Hillary because she loves this country,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cShe\u2019s been in battles before where if it didn\u2019t go her way, she accepted it, but then woke up the next day and battled again \u2026 and that love of country I think is obvious to everyone.\u201d\n\nKaine closed by saying that much work remained and quoted William Faulkner: \u201cThey kilt us but they ain\u2019t whupped us yit,\u201d he said, to loud applause.\n\nPolls leading up to Election Day had widely predicted Clinton would win the presidency. Though some states remain too close to call \u2014 and it appears increasingly likely Clinton will win the popular vote \u2014 Trump pulled out a decisive number of electoral college votes in a stunning upset.\n\nClinton had been staying about a mile away at the Peninsula Hotel \u2014 very close to Trump Tower. Late Wednesday morning, she took a short car ride to the New Yorker, a historic Art Deco hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nAs a light rain fell Wednesday morning, a few harried campaign staffers corralled reporters and photographers on the sidewalk on one side of the New Yorker hotel doors and supporters and Clinton staff on the other.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m., Clinton\u2019s top image-maker Greg Hale, the man responsible for sets, backdrops and all manner of atmospherics for her biggest rallies, wandered alone on the hotel\u2019s third floor. In the ballroom, work crews put up a simple riser where Clinton spoke. Behind her was a row of American flags.\n\nThe concession speech was a stark contrast to what had been planned for Clinton on election night.\n\nThousands of Clinton\u2019s supporters had gathered Tuesday night at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for what was supposed to be a victory party for the Democratic candidate.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Anne Gearan, who covered Clinton\u2019s campaign, noted that a photograph of the stage at the Javits Center \u201creveals what the campaign had planned for her victory speech.\u201d\n\nOn the stage was a map showing the United States cast in blue.\n\n\u201cThe lighted USA outline was invisible in the room,\u201d Gearan notes. It was meant to be revealed when Clinton spoke upon being declared president-elect \u2014 under the dramatic glass ceiling of the Javits convention center.\n\nThat never occurred. Instead, Clinton campaign manager John Podesta appeared around 2 a.m. Wednesday and addressed her crestfallen supporters, urging them to go home and get some rest.\n\nThe overhead camera shot showed Podesta at the end of a gloomy election-night rally in New York.\n\nAnne Gearan contributed to this post.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-11-09/Reuters/2016-11-09T165104Z_01_GAC504_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton concedes to Trump: \u2018We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead\u2019", "summary": "It was meant to be revealed when Clinton spoke upon being declared president-elect \u2014 under the dramatic glass ceiling of the Javits convention center.\n\u201cLast night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country,\u201d Clinton said.\nAnd you should never, ever regret fighting for that.\u201dAn emotional Kaine spoke first, saying he and his wife remain proud of Clinton.\nInstead, Clinton campaign manager John Podesta appeared around 2 a.m. Wednesday and addressed her crestfallen supporters, urging them to go home and get some rest.\nIn the ballroom, work crews put up a simple riser where Clinton spoke.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": [], "keywords": ["concedes", "saying", "campaign", "clinton", "trump", "lead", "owe", "country", "work", "mind", "chance", "nation", "hillary", "spoke", "open", "supporters", "kaine"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-08 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/08/trump-wins-presidency-defeats-clinton-in-historic-election-upset.html", "text": "Donald Trump, defying the pundits and polls to the end, defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election and claimed an establishment-stunning victory that exposes the depth of voter dissatisfaction \u2013 and signals immense changes ahead for American policy at home and abroad.\n\nSeventeen months after the billionaire tycoon\u2019s Trump Tower entrance into the race, the first-time candidate once dismissed by the political elite will become the 45th president, Fox News projects.\n\nSpeaking to cheering supporters early Wednesday morning at his victory party in New York City, the Republican candidate and now president-elect said Clinton called to congratulate him, and Fox News confirms she has conceded. Despite their hard-fought campaign, Trump praised Clinton for her service and said \u201cit is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be president for all Americans,\u201d Trump vowed, after a brief introduction by running mate Mike Pence.\n\nTRUMP'S AGENDA: WHAT HIS ELECTION MEANS FOR AMERICA\n\nSounding a call to \u201creclaim our country\u2019s destiny,\u201d Trump declared: \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \u2026 America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.\u201d\n\nTrump will be the oldest president in U.S. history, entering the Oval Office at age 70. With her defeat, Clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the United States.\n\nThough Clinton called Trump, her campaign initially did not concede defeat. Earlier, her campaign chairman John Podesta addressed supporters nearby in New York and said several states were \u201ctoo close to call.\u201d\n\nClinton herself did not appear at the rally. Podesta had urged supporters to \u201chead home\u201d and said they would not have \u201canything more to say tonight.\u201d\n\nAmid Trump\u2019s victory, Republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the House and Senate, improving Trump\u2019s chances of advancing his agenda in office.\n\nA surge of support in key battlegrounds \u2013 and especially surprise victories in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 helped propel Trump to victory. The GOP nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Iowa.\n\nClinton won her share of battlegrounds, including Virginia and Nevada and Colorado, but could not make up for Trump\u2019s strong performance in other states thought to favor the Democrat.\n\nThe billionaire businessman\u2019s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround, after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be \u201crigged\u201d against him.\n\nClinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into Tuesday\u2019s vote, yet the polls had been tightening in the race\u2019s closing days.\n\nHis victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor \u2013 and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race.\n\nWithout question, his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent.\n\nEleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton\u2019s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but the political damage may have been done. And the WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Podesta\u2019s account became a constant distraction for the campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal concerns about the Clinton family\u2019s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries.\n\nThis at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump that came out in October (which he denies), following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory marks the second time Clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female U.S. president, having been defeated by President Obama in their 2008 primary race.\n\nBut Trump has been able to defy expectations from the start. He defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the Republican primaries \u2013 stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider, populist message; throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates; and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable, learn-as-he-goes campaign style.\n\nHe also defied party orthodoxy, railing against free-trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership and staking out a sometimes-confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve. Democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow.\n\nTrump was aided by the infrastructure of the GOP, but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by Clinton. While she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high-powered surrogates, Trump\u2019s campaign was driven mainly by him, an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers. Surrogates like retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani advocated aggressively for the Republican nominee, but he remained at odds with many influential elected Republicans who in some cases \u2013 as with House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 endorsed him, but only reluctantly. His stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals \u2013 including variations on a plan to suspend Muslim immigration from certain countries \u2013 also made party brass uncomfortable.\n\nThe late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional Republicans to abandon him entirely. But even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding Trump, whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee\u2019s tensions with the GOP establishment and saw him as the true change-maker in the election.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/11/09/0/0/694940094001_5202850312001_Donald-Trump-I-will-be-president-for-all-Americans.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Trump wins presidency, defeats Clinton in historic election upset", "summary": "Though Clinton called Trump, her campaign initially did not concede defeat.\nWith her defeat, Clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the United States.\nTrump was aided by the infrastructure of the GOP, but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by Clinton.\nA surge of support in key battlegrounds \u2013 and especially surprise victories in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 helped propel Trump to victory.\nDespite their hard-fought campaign, Trump praised Clinton for her service and said \u201cit is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d\u201cI will be president for all Americans,\u201d Trump vowed, after a brief introduction by running mate Mike Pence.", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["campaign", "clinton", "trump", "presidency", "defeats", "wins", "upset", "victory", "states", "york", "historic", "election", "president", "supporters", "trumps"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-08 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/08/2016-election-in-5-easy-charts.html", "text": "The race for president, the battle for control of Congress, and hundreds of state and local races are all being decided Tuesday.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to help you sort through what\u2019s at stake and who might have the edge.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/11/07/0/0/694940094001_5199732208001_110716-an-keating-1280.jpg?ve=1", "title": "The 2016 election in 5 easy charts", "summary": "The race for president, the battle for control of Congress, and hundreds of state and local races are all being decided Tuesday.\nHere\u2019s a guide to help you sort through what\u2019s at stake and who might have the edge.", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["sort", "race", "whats", "stake", "charts", "tuesdayheres", "hundreds", "state", "races", "election", "easy", "president", "2016", "local"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-06 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/06/donald-trump-why-you-should-vote-me/93398970/", "text": "CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of notable moments in Presidential Candidate Donald Trump's life. USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nWhy you should vote for me.\n\nDonald Trump campaigns in Sioux City, Iowa, on Nov. 6, 2016. (Photo: Brennan Linsley, AP)\n\nFor 17 months, I\u2019ve traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams.\n\nI\u2019ve been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again.\n\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare \u2014 Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof.\n\nIt also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA and China deals that have deindustrialized the United States \u2014 importing unemployment and exporting our wealth.\n\nIt means we don\u2019t have to keep kids trapped in failing schools \u2014 that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton.\n\nReal change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption.\n\nHillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis \u2014 Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt.\n\nAmerica has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation.\n\nIt is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It\u2019s there for you to read at www.TheTrumpContract.com.\n\nIn my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs.\n\nIn my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged \u201copen borders,\u201d mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America\u2019s immigration officers described Hillary\u2019s extremist plan as \u201cthe most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nI will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same.\n\nFinally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities.\n\nI am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the White House.\n\nTogether, we will take our government back from the special interests \u2014 and we will Make America Great Again.\n\nDonald J. Trump is the Republican nominee for president.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

We are glad to see that he has found, as we were confident that he would, that he has confirmed the conclusion that he reached in July,\u201d said Clinton\u2019s communications director Jennifer Palmieri, shortly before the candidate appeared at her final Ohio rally, introduced by basketball superstar LeBron James. \u201cAnd we\u2019re glad that this matter is resolved.\"\n\nShe added, \u201cI have one other thing to tell you: we are adding a guest to our rally tomorrow night in Philadelphia,\u201d as she hyped The Boss.\n\nBut Republicans, eager to see Trump continue to close in on Clinton\u2019s stable but narrow lead, were not letting the matter rest.\n\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment,\u201d said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. \"None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president.\u201d\n\nAnd House Speaker Paul Ryan, one of Trump\u2019s most tortured supporters, quickly pitched in to boost his nominee, as well. \u201cRegardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI\u2019s investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation\u2019s secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\u201d he said. \u201cShe simply believes she\u2019s above the law and always plays by her own rules ... Let\u2019s bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s own campaign was defiant, saying Comey\u2019s letter changes nothing about the perception of Clinton\u2019s corruption or Trump\u2019s chances on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have not made this a centerpiece of our messaging,\" Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC said, despite Trump calling the initial news \"worse than Watergate.\"\n\n\u201cSome things haven\u2019t changed at all. What FBI Director Comey said on July 7th under oath to Congress is still the same. That she was reckless and careless in her handling of information\u2026the reason that so many Americans have a problem with Hillary Clinton\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness and veracity does not change,\u201d Conway said.\n\nShe also broke with Trump\u2019s statement just on Friday in which he said he\u2019s \u201calways had a lot of confidence in the FBI.\u201d\n\n\u201cI immediately thought that he\u2019s mishandled the investigation from the beginning,\u201d Conway said about Comey.\n\nStill, Democrats\u2019 feeling of vindication was mixed with a heavy dose of anxiety: nine days of early voting went by since Comey\u2019s initial letter shook the race.\n\nAnd his Sunday afternoon letter to congressional leaders came as tensions between Clinton and Trump\u2019s camps near their highest points of the cycle.\n\nWhile her Republican challenger flies around the country in pursuit of any path to victory \u2014 hitting reliably Democratic states like Minnesota and others where early voting put Clinton firmly in the driver\u2019s seat, like Nevada \u2014 Clinton is piling resources into Michigan, a blue state where her campaign has long had a presence but where it acknowledges polls have tightened.\n\nBoth campaigns are guardedly optimistic about the sudden turn to Michigan: while Democrats acknowledge that the state is closer than they expected it to be at this point, they see last-minute visits from Clinton, former president Bill Clinton, and President Barack Obama as an insurance policy to stave off a last-second Trump surge while an unprecedented wave of Hispanic voters appears to have handed her unexpected strength in Florida, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s team, it\u2019s evidence that the race has tightened to the point where Clinton needs to play defense \u2014 even though no respected survey of the notoriously difficult-to-poll state has shown Trump tied or ahead there all year.\n\nAnd on Sunday morning, the final NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of the cycle landed with Clinton ahead of Trump by four points nationwide, 44 to 40 percent \u2014 roughly the same margin as other national polls have recently shown. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll also released Sunday morning reaffirmed the small-but-steady lead, showing the Democratic nominee with a three-point cushion, 45 percent to Trump\u2019s 42 percent.\n\nBut far from settling into a groove, a restless energy has overtaken the contest, as Clinton avoided mentioning the FBI news on Sunday in Cleveland \u2014 after stopping through a Philadelphia church \u2014 and Trump strove to stay on message in Iowa and Minnesota.\n\nTrump\u2019s team in particular has been on high alert after the real estate developer was rushed from the Reno stage on Saturday night when an audience member\u2019s sign was mistaken for a gun and the Secret Service tackled him. Both Donald Trump Jr., the candidate\u2019s son, and Dan Scavino, the campaign\u2019s social media chief, retweeted a supporter\u2019s message calling the moment an \u201cassassination attempt,\u201d despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nAnd emboldened by his furious fly-around, Trump amped up his similarly unfounded claims of election-rigging, even calling Clinton\u2019s late-campaign concerts featuring celebrities like Jay Z, Beyonce, and Katy Perry \u201calmost like a form of cheating\u201d and \u201cdemeaning to the political process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, apparently pointing to long lines at a heavily Latino polling place in Nevada that forced the location to stay open late, Trump questioned whether there had been any improper activity at \u201ccertain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County.\"\n\n\u201cFolks, it\u2019s a rigged system. It\u2019s a rigged system, and we\u2019re going to beat it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe campaign\u2019s made it very clear: a clear outcome, obviously both sides will accept,\u201d Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI think both campaigns have also been very clear that in the event of disputed results, they reserve all legal rights and remedies.\"\n\nSeeking to further rev up his base on Sunday, the Trump campaign sent supporters a battleground map showing Nevada, Florida, North Carolina, and Maine leaning red, with Arizona, Utah, and Georgia firmly in the Republican camp and Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Virginia in the toss-up category \u2014 categorizations that do not fit the public polling.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, was visiting Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire on Sunday in a bid to energize African-American voters in Cuyahoga County one more time with a joint rally with LeBron James, and to energize her supporters in the other two states where there\u2019s been no early voting.\n\nStill dogged by lagging African-American turnout and the ongoing release of campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails by WikiLeaks after what appears to be a Russian hack, the campaign is fighting the perception that it\u2019s trudging to the finish line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got pretty thick skin, Chuck. So you know, what I\u2019ve worried about is to make sure that, you know, this is an unprecedented situation where a foreign power hacked my emails as with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange to dribble them out in order to maximize the damage to Hillary and to maximize the help to Donald Trump, who\u2019s adopted \u2014 essentially \u2014 Russian foreign policy and rejected bipartisan U.S. foreign policy,\u201d Podesta said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of an unprecedented circumstance. But look, my job is to make sure that we\u2019re doing what we need to do to make sure that those volunteers are on doors, on the phones. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do to win this election.\"\n\nYet Clinton's campaign\u2019s lingering confidence is largely buoyed by early-voting figures in Nevada and Florida. A surge of Latino voters in Las Vegas\u2019 Clark County, for example, pushed Democrats\u2019 lead in early voting to 72,000 ballots \u2014 larger than it was four years ago, when Obama won the state by nearly 7 points.\n\nAnd in Florida, Latino voters have cast roughly 14 percent of the early and absentee votes, far ahead of their 2012 pace, when Obama narrowly beat Mitt Romney there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a different kind of coalition and a bigger coalition,\u201d said Podesta. \u201cYou mentioned the historic Hispanic turnout that we\u2019re seeing in Florida, Nevada, where we feel very, very good.\"\n\nWith Clinton clinging to a small but sturdy lead, Trump on Sunday kept up his talk of a \u201crigged\u201d election, keeping alive the prospect that he might not accept a defeat on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand it\u2019s a rigged system and she\u2019s protected,\u201d he said at his Minnesota rally.", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c4/c9/cbe1185446598f5fab990673523c/161106-hillary-clinton-ap-1160.jpg", "title": "Clinton gets late break in battle with Trump", "summary": "Hillary Clinton should never be president.\u201dAnd House Speaker Paul Ryan, one of Trump\u2019s most tortured supporters, quickly pitched in to boost his nominee, as well.\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment,\u201d said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.\n\"We have not made this a centerpiece of our messaging,\" Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC said, despite Trump calling the initial news \"worse than Watergate.\nBut Republicans, eager to see Trump continue to close in on Clinton\u2019s stable but narrow lead, were not letting the matter rest.\n\"Trump\u2019s own campaign was defiant, saying Comey\u2019s letter changes nothing about the perception of Clinton\u2019s corruption or Trump\u2019s chances on Tuesday.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Josh Gerstein", "Steven Shepard", "Gabriel Debenedetti"], "keywords": ["late", "nevada", "clinton", "trump", "campaign", "state", "break", "clintons", "trumps", "letter", "battle", "rally", "gets", "hillary"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-05 00:00:00", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/05/go-ahead-throw-your-vote-away", "text": "I recently had a pleasant encounter with a great and outspoken American who, despite his libertarian leanings, supports Hillary Clinton for president. I congratulated him on making a tough call but allowed as how I was looking forward to casting my ballot for the Libertarian Party's flag bearers, Gary Johnson and William Weld. \"It will be unadulterated pleasure,\" I offered, \"as there is no opportunity cost.\"\n\nMy correspondent fired back: \"Opportunity cost is Trump gets elected.\"\n\nI stand by my recklessness.\n\nHere's where the curious nature of the American Electoral College comes in handy. Even where my vote\u2014or the votes of my 100 closest, most easily influenced \"inner circle\"\u2014might swing an election, there is simply no real chance that pushing either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton over the top in South Carolina, where I live, will determine the outcome of the presidential race. If Hillary wobbles to victory in my current state of residence, she would have already demolished The Donald in the Electoral College. Similarly, in Maryland (where our family lived until 2014), a squeaker for Mr. Trump would indicate that Ms. Clinton had been vanquished in a yuuuuuge landslide elsewhere.\n\nNow, it is extremely unlikely that any one person's vote will rock even one state's electoral outcome. In the closest state presidential election of the last half-century\u2014New Mexico (no, not Florida) in 2000\u2014the final margin for Al Gore came to 366. And even that did not swing the national prize.\n\nBut set those slim odds of individual influence at the state level off to one (long-shot) side. Assuming that you live in a red or blue, and not a purple, state, you swing completely out of the loop. In its most recent election forecast, the prediction site FiveThirtyEight estimates that there is a 17.9 percent chance that Florida will decide the election (putting one of the candidates \"over the top\"). Next in line are Ohio and Pennsylvania, where the chances are 11.5 percent each, followed by Michigan at 8.7 percent and Wisconsin at 6.2 percent. When you account for North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Georgia, Nevada, and Iowa, you've eliminated all the states with as much as an estimated 2 percent chance to determine the outcome. Multiply that by the probability that one's own vote can throw one's state from Hillary to Donald or back, and the prospect that your vote will crown the next chief of state is neatly forecast as equal to 0.0.\n\nThis safe harbor protects 67 percent of U.S. population, that portion living beyond the aforementioned swing states. This logic is not lost on the general public, which tends to vote for third parties more often in \"one-party\" states.\n\nCitizens realize that they are not trekking to the polls to cast the deciding national vote but to do their patriotic duty, taking pride in affixing an \"I Voted!\" sticker to their lapels and relishing the thought of canceling out some barbarian's vote (or their spouse's). But why not go commando and check the ballot for a person you'd actually prefer to see as president? In most states, the Electoral College makes this a guilt-free option.\n\nConsequential outcomes from individual presidential votes are so unlikely that Americans cast their chief of state endorsements while investing far less in research about their choice than the investigative effort they sink to select a smartphone data plan or their next Pokemon Go venue. This is straightforward: Decisions that affect actual results generally invite more attention than those that do not. It is called \"rational ignorance.\"\n\nIn another sense, it's liberating. Because your one tally will not change the nation's fate, you can afford to exercise your judgment worry-free. You are not at fault if Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton should win. Meanwhile, you will have indulged your conscience.\n\nIt is often said that voting third party is \"throwing your vote away.\" It would be more accurate to say that living in a non-swing state is throwing your vote away. One tactic to recapture some modicum of vote value is to pad the total for an upstart candidate. Moreover, you might help (if modestly) to put the system on notice that the Big Two political party choices are being rejected. Even when the minor parties do not elect a president, they can thus wield power. The classic example is the Socialist Party, which garnered a paltry 880,000 votes in the 1932 election, barely 2 percent of the total cast, but over the course of the decade saw significant pieces of its platform co-opted by the New Deal. Within years, versions of the party's proposals for Social Security, a minimum wage, and large-scale public works were law.\n\nIn this year's campaign, I am insulated from liability by the Electoral College. And the presidential festivities, in my view, feature two highly undesirable major party candidates. The Founders have spared me from having to precisely calibrate my coefficient of disgust. Voting for Libertarians who have an exceedingly slim chance of victory will be the least complicated choice I will make\u2014until Saturday's Pokemon Go selections are available.", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1476739375935.jpg", "title": "Go Ahead, Throw Your Vote Away", "summary": "In the closest state presidential election of the last half-century\u2014New Mexico (no, not Florida) in 2000\u2014the final margin for Al Gore came to 366.\nNow, it is extremely unlikely that any one person's vote will rock even one state's electoral outcome.\nThis safe harbor protects 67 percent of U.S. population, that portion living beyond the aforementioned swing states.\n\" It would be more accurate to say that living in a non-swing state is throwing your vote away.\nIt is often said that voting third party is \"throwing your vote away.", "source": "Reason", "bias": "Bias: Lean Right", "authors": ["Thomas W"], "keywords": ["trump", "ahead", "away", "electoral", "hillary", "states", "state", "election", "swing", "vote", "party", "throw", "presidential"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-05 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/us/politics/presidential-election.html?ref=politics&_r=0", "text": "In Florida, at least 200,000 more Hispanics had voted early as of Friday than did during the entire early-voting period four years ago, according to an analysis by Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who helped run President Obama\u2019s two campaigns here.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNevada, another crucial battleground, is proving to be a similar story.\n\nAccording to Jon Ralston, a political analyst for KTNV, high turnout from Latinos and Democrats in the state\u2019s crucial Clark County is a bad omen for Republicans.\n\nDemocrats outpaced Republicans in Clark County by 11,000 votes cast on Friday, Mr. Ralston reported, giving Mrs. Clinton a larger firewall than Mr. Obama had in the state when he won by seven points in 2012.\n\n____\n\nClinton, returning to South Florida to galvanize Latino voters, basks in the rain.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s afternoon rally in Pembroke Pines, Fla., an increasingly diverse community in Broward County, was aimed at inspiring the region\u2019s mix of Hispanic, black, Caribbean and Jewish voters to cast early ballots.\n\nBut a driving rain diverted Mrs. Clinton from her script and revealed a happy warrior rarely seen on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to remember,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI want to be the president for everybody: everybody who agrees with me, people who don\u2019t agree with me, people who will vote for me, people who don\u2019t vote for me.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Michael Barbaro described the scene as a moment with an \u201cunfamiliar sense of abandon and joy,\u201d with Mrs. Clinton smiling widely and waving her arms as the rain drenched her.\n\nPhoto\n\n____\n\nAt a rally in Tampa, Trump calls Clinton a \u2018constitutional crisis\u2019 in the making.

Ryan joined Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, for a rally in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state.\n\nWhile Mr. Ryan has generally steered clear of the Trump campaign in recent weeks, he recently acknowledged that he had voted for Mr. Trump along with all of the other Republicans on the ballot. On Saturday, he was more vociferous in his support of the nominee, promising to work with him to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump says that he wants a special session to repeal and replace Obamacare, let me tell you that as speaker of the House, we are ready, we are willing and we have a plan to do that,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.\n\nThe relationship between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump remains frosty, but it was clear that the highest-ranking Republican in Congress felt genuine affection for Mr. Pence as a kindred conservative spirit. \u201cI have seen this man, when no one is watching this man, be a man of courage, of integrity,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cHe is from the heart of the conservative movement.\u201d\n\n____\n\nTrump plans a last-minute trip to Minnesota.\n\nThe campaigns are keeping their schedules fluid in the race\u2019s final days, shifting plans and dispatching surrogates as polls and early-voting returns trickle in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump said on Saturday that he would make a stop in Minnesota before Election Day, and Mr. Pence is expected to do the same.

But there is no in-person early voting in the state, so data-obsessed Democrats are somewhat uneasy about where they actually stand. In particular, they are concerned that turnout among millennials and African-Americans may taper off from Mr. Obama\u2019s two wins.\n\nThe solution: Mrs. Clinton plans to visit Philadelphia twice in the campaign\u2019s closing days, once with the pop singer Katy Perry on Saturday night and then, in a flashing neon sign of continuity, with the president and Michelle Obama on Monday evening for one final pre-election rally.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/06/us/elections/06trump-1/06trump-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "Presidential Election: A Closing Act, With Clinton, Trump and a Tiny \u2018Future Construction Worker\u2019", "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cOh, look, a future construction worker,\u201d Mr. Trump said, pointing to an infant in the crowd.\nBut a driving rain diverted Mrs. Clinton from her script and revealed a happy warrior rarely seen on the campaign trail.\nThe relationship between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump remains frosty, but it was clear that the highest-ranking Republican in Congress felt genuine affection for Mr. Pence as a kindred conservative spirit.\nMrs. Clinton has been dominant there in the polls, benefiting from the mix of suburban moderates and liberal city voters.\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Clinton is extending her strategy of trying to turn free concerts into votes.", "source": "New York Times", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Jonathan Martin"], "keywords": ["mr", "clinton", "trump", "voters", "republicans", "worker", "ryan", "tiny", "mrs", "pence", "state", "future", "election", "act", "rally", "construction", "closing", "presidential"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-11-03 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/3/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaigning-hard-in-f/?utm_source=RSS_Feedutm_medium%3DRSS", "text": "It had to end sometime.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump are all but tied in the latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll, which finds Clinton backers slipping behind in enthusiasm even as the Democrat has an edge in early voting.\n\nThe tracking poll finds little shift in Clinton's overall support following news of the FBI's renewed look at Clinton emails, but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Trump in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. By 53 to 43 percent, more Trump supporters say they are \"very enthusiastic\" about him, compared with Thursday and Friday when Trump's edge was negligible (53 percent vs. 51 percent).\n\nVoter enthusiasm has been in short supply for both Clinton and Trump through the fall campaign and continues to lag excitement about candidates on the ballot four years ago. At this point in 2012, 64 percent of Obama supporters said they were \"very enthusiastic\" about him; Romney was only narrowly behind at 61 percent.\n\nTrump and Clinton continue to run nearly even in overall vote preferences, with Trump at 46 percent and Clinton 45 percent in a four-way contest in the poll conducted Thursday through Sunday. The margin is a mirror 48-47 Clinton-Trump split when third-party candidates are asked which major-party candidate they lean toward, a comparison that has grown in importance as support declines steadily for Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein.\n\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail View Photos The GOP presidential nominee is pressing his case ahead of Election Day.

The level of early voting so far is roughly in line with expectations, given the 24.7 million early votes tracked so far by the United States Election Project, which amounts to 19 percent of the 129 million ballots cast in 2012.\n\nClinton has a modest 54-41 percent edge among early voters in an average of the three most recent tracking poll waves, while Trump leads by a 50-39 percent margin among those looking to vote on Election Day; those who anticipate voting early are more evenly split. Those breakdowns should be treated with caution, given both the sizable 8.5-point margin of sampling error around that result as well as general challenges in tracking attitudes among a rapidly growing population.\n\nOlder Americans have flocked to vote early, with 38 percent of senior likely voters saying they have done so, compared with 18 percent of those ages 40 to 64 and 17 percent of voters younger than that. Women are slightly more apt to report voting early than men (26 vs. 19 percent), as are voters in urban areas (28 percent) compared with suburban and rural voters (19 percent and 22 percent).\n\n[Graphic: Who different groups are supporting]\n\nHorse-race breakdown\n\nThe daily tracking poll's latest four-night wave finds voters splitting sharply along traditional political divisions, with Trump's previously lagging support among core Republican groups now nearly matching Clinton's wide support on the left. Trump holds 78 percent support among white evangelical Protestants, 77 percent among conservatives, 68 percent among rural voters and 59 percent among white men. Clinton answers with 81 percent support among liberals, 67 percent of those identifying with no religion, 60 percent of those in urban areas and 72 percent among nonwhites.\n\n[Clinton leads Trump in Virginia in new Post poll]\n\nClinton and Trump receive similar support among fellow partisans, but Trump maintains an 18-point edge among political independents, significantly higher than Republicans have held in recent elections. Looking deeper at that group over a seven-day stretch, 77 percent of independents who say they lean Democratic prefer Clinton while a similar 80 percent who lean Republican favor Trump. But Trump holds a sizable 53-28 percent advantage among voters who say they don't lean toward either party, a group that accounts for about 10 percent of likely voters.\n\n1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes to an end View Photos Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

I am enjoying the revival of FBI interest in Hillary Clinton\u2019s email skullduggery as much as anyone eager to prevent her presidency. But as we move toward the final week of the election, I have to ask: how much is this really going to matter?\n\nMy hope is that it matters greatly. I hope a few million Hillary voters have reached the snapping point and simply cannot support her any longer. And if they have, please understand that many may have voted already. If we learn nothing else from this chapter, can we please recognize the insanity of early voting? She may actually win by a margin of votes cast for her already, because we have allowed ourselves to marinate in the absurdity that convenience and greater turnout are the most important thing in an election.\n\nBut to return to the matter at hand. FBI Director James Comey is on a political rotisserie spit, grilled by the left after weeks of torching by the flames of conservative indignation. But do not draw a false equivalency in those outcries. Clinton opponents were properly incensed when he detailed a strong case for indicting her in that infamous July statement, only to fail to recommend charges. Today, his re-opening of the case smacks of a decision to actually pay attention to facts and evidence.\n\nHillary supporters are on solid enough ground when they observe the curiosity of Comey\u2019s revelation of a re-opened case without much of a shred of specificity as to why. Under normal circumstances, perhaps investigators would have perused the relevant messages sufficiently to reveal a detailed rationale for additional investigation.\n\nBut these are not normal circumstances. The FBI did not learn of these additional emails last week. The ticking clock grew louder, increasing the possibility of a bombshell revelation shaking loose as its subject was preparing to take the oath of office, or even after she had. That would not have been a positive development for an FBI whose director was already wounded by charges of corruption.\n\nSo Comey sprang forth faster than he otherwise might have, leaving us with a story that is damaging to the frontrunner and useful to the pursuer. But how much? How many votes actually move as a result of this October surprise?\n\nPolitical damage should always be measured in terms of supporters driven away. Benghazi, for example, has never hurt Hillary Clinton in any appreciable manner, because only conservatives care about it. Few, if any, who hold those offenses against her had any intention of voting for her anyway. Similarly, most of the people who considered the Billy Bush tapes a nuclear bomb were Trump-haters already. The only way for a story to sink teeth into a candidate is if it changes voting behavior.\n\nPoll numbers had been tightening in recent days because attention was peeling away from sideshows and gravitating toward actual issues suggestive of the differences between a Trump and Clinton administration. It has always been a foggy matter to assess how much Hillary Clinton\u2019s stunning levels of corruption were actually damaging her. It certainly did not restrain her from rising to poll leads that made many conclude the race was all but over.\n\nBut it\u2019s not. And now it\u2019s really not. It will be mid-week before we have wide data on how much this new FBI probe has hurt her. It may not hurt that much at all. If Donald Trump wins this thing, it will be because he strung together a final-week push full of message discipline and sharply-defined policy differences. It will not be because James Comey rediscovered his duty to act based on what investigators find.\n\nFor the new email story to be a factor, it will have to pry a wedge into an already identifiable enthusiasm gap. Enthusiasm alone does not lead to the presidency; ask Bernie Sanders, or Ron Paul. But in a campaign between candidates with roughly equivalent voter appeal, a close race can be tipped if supporters on one side are on fire with motivation while the others are more tepid.\n\nFor evidence, return to the last election. 2012 was completely winnable for Mitt Romney, but due to some factors that were his fault and some that were not, millions of Republicans simply found him under-inspiring. Simultaneously, Barack Obama did not ride the wave of enthusiasm that lofted him in 2008, but there was enough left in that tank to fuel him past Romney for a second term.\n\nPerhaps next Tuesday is the flip side of that coin. On paper, Hillary Clinton brings an impressive enough candidacy in terms of biography and fundraising. But a meager set of campaign skills and an underbelly of trust issues, even among Democrats, has kept her from closing the deal.\n\nAnd perhaps the underestimated enthusiasm this time belongs to Trump. After a year of coverage of his massive rallies, it may seem odd to call his appeal underestimated, but it surely is, by all the smart kids in the enclaves of the elites. Those rallies mean nothing, they say; Hillary has a far better ground game, more money, more experience in the trenches.\n\nAll true. And maybe this year, irrelevant. In the model of the Brexit vote, there is surely a hidden sliver of Trump appeal, fashioned from voters who avoid pollsters and various other traditional channels of publicizing their preference. It is impossible to know whether that will amount to one or five percent from state to state, but even if it\u2019s in the middle there somewhere, throw in the wet blanket effect of this new FBI story, and the result is his campaign prospects brightening while hers dim.\n\nEnough to make the difference November 8? Predictions are as foolish eight days out as they were eight months out. But it may not be the smartest thing for the Clinton campaign to insult the FBI director they loved mere weeks ago. And as they call for these new emails to be released, they know full well how unlikely that is. Their ploy to give off one last whiff of transparency is colossally outweighed by their behavior from the beginning of this tawdry tale.\n\nThe air is thick with anticipation that the Clinton camp plans a November surprise to distract us from the October bomb that just detonated. But one wonders, even if they still have something up their tattered sleeve, if it will be as direct an indicator of what kind of presidency awaits.", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/272/78396fe0-112b-48c7-a845-521605dc3007.jpg", "title": "Will The Reopening Of Hillary's Email Case Matter?", "summary": "Benghazi, for example, has never hurt Hillary Clinton in any appreciable manner, because only conservatives care about it.\nHillary supporters are on solid enough ground when they observe the curiosity of Comey\u2019s revelation of a re-opened case without much of a shred of specificity as to why.\nOn paper, Hillary Clinton brings an impressive enough candidacy in terms of biography and fundraising.\nToday, his re-opening of the case smacks of a decision to actually pay attention to facts and evidence.\nBut it may not be the smartest thing for the Clinton campaign to insult the FBI director they loved mere weeks ago.", "source": "Guest Writer - Right", "bias": "Bias: Lean Right", "authors": ["Mark Davis", "Christine Rousselle", "Katie Pavlich", "Ap News"], "keywords": ["case", "hillarys", "trump", "campaign", "thing", "actually", "reopening", "matter", "hillary", "enthusiasm", "clinton", "fbi", "voting", "email", "supporters"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-29 13:41:08-04:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comey-attorney-general-email_us_5814cff1e4b0390e69d094e3?section=us_politics", "text": "MANDEL NGAN/Getty Images FBI Director James Comey, left, stands alongside Attorney General Loretta Lynch during a press conference at the Department of Justice on March 24, 2016.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 FBI Director James Comey\u2019s unprecedented decision to insert the bureau into the presidential campaign less than two weeks from Election Day has caused a rift in federal law enforcement.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch wanted Comey to follow DOJ protocols and traditions and not reveal the discovery of new emails that might be pertinent to Clinton\u2019s case, The Huffington Post was able to confirm on Saturday, following the account of a Justice Department official in The Washington Post.\n\nThe U.S. Attorneys\u2019 manual emphasizes the importance of \u201climited confidentiality\u201d in \u201congoing operations and investigations\u201d to safeguard \u201cthe rights of victims and litigants as well as the protection of the life and safety of other parties and witnesses.\u201d\n\nJulie Werner-Simon, a former federal prosecutor who retired from DOJ in August 2015 after 29 years of service, argues that Comey\u2019s decision to make public an incremental development in the investigation with little clear significance is a breach of the protocol outlined in the manual.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking and disheartening that someone I admired would do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I did what he did, I would be censured.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy view is that there should be an investigation\u201d into Comey\u2019s behavior, she added. \u201cUnder the rules that he violated, that investigation should be secret. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nThere are exceptions to this protocol under unusual circumstances, but Comey would have had to consult with a senior official at DOJ before doing so, according to Werner-Simon, who instructed federal prosecutors about these protocols as senior litigation counsel at DOJ, the last position she held there.\n\n\u201cWho gave him permission? If he is going to use unusual circumstances under the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Manual, who did he discuss it with?\u201d Werner-Simon said.\n\nNancy Gertner, a retired federal judge appointed by President Bill Clinton who now lectures at Harvard Law School, had a similarly stinging indictment of Comey\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI cannot think of any reason except Comey\u2019s own personal interests to make public the possibility that there may be emails whose content he does not know that may be relevant to the investigation,\u201d Gertner said.\n\nTo release that kind of information is outrageous. Nancy Gertner, retired federal judge\n\n\u201cTo release that kind of information is outrageous,\u201d she added. \u201cThe FBI typically does not release information about an ongoing investigation, information that could have an impact on an upcoming election \u2015 and he does not have the foggiest idea what is in these emails.\u201d\n\nThe professional considerations that may have motivated Comey are obvious. Comey, a Republican, faced considerable criticism and scrutiny from congressional Republicans for declining to press charges against Clinton for her handling of classified emails on a private email server.\n\nComey appeared to recognize the unusual nature of his decision to release the information about the newly unearthed emails on Friday in a letter to his employees explaining the choice.\n\n\u201cOf course, we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cI also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some former federal prosecutors believe that based on his previous statements, Comey was required to follow up with Congress.\n\nSolomon Wisenberg, a former federal prosecutor who served as deputy independent counsel in the investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, argues that Comey made a mistake in July when, in an announcement that the DOJ was not pressing charges, he criticized Clinton\u2019s behavior and subsequently testified that he would re-open the investigation if new information warranted it. In so doing, Comey obligated himself to keep Congress up to date, argued Wisenberg.\n\n\u201cHis duty was to shut up and he didn\u2019t. If you want to talk about violating protocol, he has provided a roadmap,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving made that error, Comey was likely obligated to inform Congress about the discovery of the new emails, according to Wisenberg, who is now a white-collar criminal defense attorney.\n\n\u201cHe told them if things change, he would report to them.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 FBI Director James Comey said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau's previously closed inquiry into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information, restarting a long-simmering debate over the Democratic nominee's conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Clinton appeared to be putting away.\n\nIn a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision, Comey said \"the FBI cannot yet assess\" whether the information is \"significant\" nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment.\n\nBut an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials, perhaps thousands of emails, were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. Comey was briefed on the findings in recent days, resulting in the director's notification to Congress, said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Weiner, who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Abedin also had access to the same device or devices.\n\nThe official said it was not likely that the FBI's review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day.\n\nIn a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening, Clinton said, \"The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\" a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The Democratic nominee called on the FBI \"to release all the information that it has.\"\n\n\"As you know I've had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,\" Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Thursday night.\n\nDuring a speech in New Hampshire earlier in the day, the Republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the \"breaking news announcement.\"\n\n\"Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\" Trump said, and her \"criminal scheme\" should not be allowed in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Perhaps justice will be done,\" the GOP nominee said of the development.\n\nIn his statement, Podesta demanded that the FBI director \"provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter'' to lawmakers.\n\n\"Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,'' Podesta said. \"In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\n\"It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,\" Podesta added.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had \"surfaced to change the president's opinion and views of Secretary Clinton.''\n\n\"He's going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day,\" Schultz said.\n\nIn July, Comey announced that while Clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of State had been \"extremely careless\" in the way they'd handled classified information, he recommended that no criminal charges be filed.\n\nIn her press conference Friday, Clinton said she was \"confident\" whatever is included in the new messages under review \"will not change the conclusion reached in July.\"\n\nHillary Clinton speaks during a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Oct. 28, 2016.

Emails between Tanden and Podesta show frustration over Clinton\u2019s email controversy. (Yuri Gripas /Reuters)\n\nOn the day the news broke that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account as secretary of state, the man who would soon be named to chair her presidential campaign fired off a note of distress, venting frustration about some of Clinton\u2019s closest aides.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of transparency, our friends Kendall, Cheryl and Phillipe sure weren\u2019t forthcoming on the facts here,\u201d John Podesta complained in the March 2015 note, referring to Clinton\u2019s personal lawyer, David Kendall, as well as former State Department staffers Cheryl Mills and Philippe Reines.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,\u201d replied Neera Tanden, a longtime Podesta friend who also has worked for Clinton. Then, answering her own question, Tanden wrote again: \u201cI guess I know the answer. They wanted to get away with it.\u201d\n\nThe exchange, found in hacked emails from Podesta\u2019s account and released Tuesday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, provides a striking window into how the revelation of Clinton\u2019s email setup roiled her nascent campaign team in the weeks before its official April 2015 kickoff.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s John Wagner breaks down some of the consequences of the release by WikiLeaks of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe emails show that while aides struggled to get past the public controversy, they also expressed exasperation at each other and, at times, at Clinton \u2014 both for her decision to use the server and for the way she handled questions about it. Several exchanges illustrate fears among some top advisers that Clinton and other aides were demonstrating the very traits that polls suggested made her vulnerable: a penchant for secrecy and a hesitancy to admit fault or error.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken on a lot of water that won\u2019t be easy to pump out of the boat,\u201d Podesta wrote to Tanden in September 2015, at a time when Clinton\u2019s campaign feared that Vice President Biden was about to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cMost of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts.\u201d\n\nTanden responded, \u201cAlmost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible.\u201d\n\nTanden and Kendall declined to comment. Neither Reines nor a lawyer for Mills responded to requests for comment.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has largely declined to comment on the WikiLeaks emails, which U.S. officials say were stolen through hacks of Democratic groups and leaders orchestrated by the Russian government. Clinton aides have declined to authenticate the emails, noting that the Russians have been known to doctor documents, but they have not disputed any specific revelation from Podesta\u2019s email trove.\n\nInstead, Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin on Tuesday responded to questions about the internal campaign struggles revealed in the emails by attacking GOP nominee Donald Trump for his recent comments disputing U.S. government findings that the Kremlin was behind the hacks and for \u201ccheering on WikiLeaks\u2019 Russian-directed propaganda.\u201d\n\nThough the WikiLeaks disclosures have not contained the sort of campaign-shaking bombshell that some Trump backers had hoped for, the Podesta emails have provided an almost unprecedented historical archive of the inner workings of a major-party presidential campaign.\n\n1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail View Photos The Democratic presidential nominee hits the road as Election Day nears.

Both are strong supporters of Clinton and her presidential bid. In another email released by WikiLeaks, Tanden referred to herself as a \u201cloyal soldier\u201d who would \u201cdo whatever Hillary needs always.\u201d Their email exchanges often appear to have been written out of concern for Clinton\u2019s best interests.\n\n\u201cI know this email thing isn\u2019t on the level. I\u2019m fully aware of that,\u201d Tanden wrote in an August 2015 note to Podesta. \u201cBut her inability to just do a national interview and communicate genuine feelings of remorse and regret is now, I fear, becoming a character problem (more so than honesty).\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 4, Clinton gave an interview to NBC News\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying that she was \u201csorry that this has been confusing to people\u201d but otherwise dodging questions about whether she apologized for her actions.\n\nTanden wrote later that day: \u201cEveryone wants her to apologize. And she should. Apologies are like her Achilles heel.\u201d\n\nThree days later, Clinton had still not apologized, even as the issue dominated campaign news coverage. \u201cThis apology thing has become like a pa\u00adthol\u00adogy,\u201d Tanden wrote. \u201cI can only imagine what\u2019s happening in the campaign. Is there some way I can be helpful here?\u201d\n\nPodesta replied: \u201cYou should email her. She can say she\u2019s sorry without apologizing to the American people. Tell her to say it and move on, why get hung on this.\u201d\n\nFinally, the next day, Clinton told ABC News that her use of the server had been a \u201cmistake.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I take responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nThe WikiLeaks disclosures reveal how, from the earliest days of the campaign, some advisers and staffers feared that Mills \u2014 who had served in the White House counsel\u2019s office during the Republican investigations of the 1990s and then was Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department \u2014 enabled Clinton\u2019s tendencies to hunker down.\n\nIn her March 2015 exchange with Podesta about the email controversy, Tanden lay the blame squarely at Mills\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cThis is a cheryl special,\u201d Tanden wrote. \u201cKnow you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heal. Or kryptonite. she just can\u2019t say no to this s---.\u201d\n\nMills has no formal relationship with the campaign but, the emails show, consults frequently about all major decisions. If Clinton wins, Mills could assume a significant role in the White House.\n\nThe emails show, at one point, similar skepticism of Mills from campaign manager Robbie Mook, the young operative Clinton appointed to build an operation that would avoid the personality clashes and internal dramas that plagued her 2008 presidential bid.\n\nIn February 2015, Mook complained to Podesta that Mills was going around him to vet campaign contractors. \u201cIt is secretly going around a transparent system we all agreed upon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe secret s--- has got to stop. It\u2019s a giant time suck.\u201d\n\nThe emails also show a fondness among Clinton\u2019s staff for her strengths and genuine enthusiasm when she did well in interviews or other public appearances.

Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided. Last week she was up by six points (45-39 percent) and before that by seven (45-38 percent).\n\nThe poll, released Wednesday, finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup. That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin. She was up 7 a week ago (49-42 percent).\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS.\n\nTrump is helped by increased backing among independents and greater strength of support: 68 percent of those backing Trump support him \u201cstrongly,\u201d compared to 61 percent for Clinton.\n\nIndependents favor Trump over Clinton by 13 points (41-28 percent). He had a 7-point advantage last week, and two weeks ago they were tied at 35 percent each. Third-party candidates play a role here, as Gary Johnson (14 percent) and Jill Stein (7 percent) receive the combined support of more than one-in-five independents.\n\nIn the four-way race, Trump leads among whites (+14 points) and men (+5), although his best groups remain white evangelical Christians (+56) and whites without a college degree (+28).\n\nClinton has commanding leads among blacks (+77 points), unmarried women (+27), voters under 30 (+18), and women (+10). First-time voters are also more likely to back her (+16).\n\nThe candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful: 83 percent of Democrats back Clinton, while 81 percent of Republicans support Trump.\n\n\u201cTo be competitive, Trump needs to consolidate support among Republicans and carry independents,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s made in-roads in the last week, mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and Obamacare.\u201d Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson.\n\nTrump\u2019s substantive strength is the economy. He\u2019s trusted over Clinton by four points, yet that\u2019s the only issue where he bests her. More trust Clinton to handle foreign policy (+15 points), immigration (+3), and terrorism (+3).\n\nWho would voters put across the table with Russian President Vladimir Putin? More trust Clinton to negotiate with Putin by 3 points (47-44 percent among registered voters). That\u2019s down from a 13-point lead on this measure in April (53-40 percent).\n\nAll in all, likely voters don\u2019t think Trump is up to the task: less than half think he\u2019s qualified to be president (46 percent) and even fewer feel he has the temperament to serve effectively (36 percent). Plus, over half lack confidence in his judgment in a crisis (56 percent).\n\nClinton trounces Trump on each of those measures: 64 percent believe she\u2019s qualified, 62 percent say she has the temperament, and 56 percent are confident in her judgment.\n\nPlus, Clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings. She has a net negative rating of eight points (45 favorable vs. 53 unfavorable), while Trump is underwater by 14 (42 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable). In addition, when undecided voters and those backing third-party candidates are combined, 26 percent have a favorable view of Clinton vs. 18 percent for Trump.\n\nYet despite Trump\u2019s weaknesses on traits, it\u2019s still a tight race. That\u2019s because, at least in part, lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote. By a 59-28 percent margin, more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates. Those backing Trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57-point margin (73-16 percent). For Clinton supporters, the choice is more about issues by 12 points (47-35 percent).\n\nCompared to 2008, this is a more character driven election. At that time, voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 71-14 percent margin.\n\n\"The bottom hasn't fallen out for Trump and Clinton hasn't pulled away, but the race isn\u2019t as close as the 3-point lead suggests,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cTrump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of third-party candidates, and that\u2019s extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment, temperament, and qualifications to be president.\"\n\nThere are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched. First, 52 percent feel Clinton \u201cstands up\u201d for people like them, and 49 percent feel that way about Trump.\n\nAlso on their honesty -- or lack thereof: a record-low 30 percent of likely voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 34 percent say Trump is.\n\nPollpourri\n\nHere are five additional takeaways from the poll.\n\n- 63 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters believe things in the United States generally favor \u201cother people,\u201d rather than people like them. Forty-four percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters feel that way.\n\n- Twice as many voters expect Clinton to win as think Trump will (64-26 percent). Fully 86 percent of Democrats think Clinton will win, while 49 percent of Republicans think Trump will.\n\n- Trump supporters (34 percent) are more than three times as likely as Clinton supporters (10 percent) to say they won\u2019t accept the election outcome if their candidate loses. Eighty-eight percent of Clinton supporters say they\u2019ll accept the outcome, up from 74 percent in September.\n\n- The generic congressional ballot test is also tight: 47 percent back the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, while 45 percent support the Republican. Among those backing the GOP congressional candidate, 79 percent go for Trump in the four-way presidential race. Clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the Democratic candidate.\n\n\u201cModels suggest a 2-point Democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the House and 4 in the Senate,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cThat means the GOP would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the House, while the Senate would be very much up for grabs.\u201d\n\n- The political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters. The Democratic Party has a net positive rating of four points (51 percent favorable vs. 47 percent unfavorable). The Republican Party has a net negative rating by just one point (48 percent favorable vs. 49 percent unfavorable).\n\nThe Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 22-25, 2016.

Open enrollment for 2017 begins Nov. 1.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department urged consumers to shop around to try to find the best deals and said 80 percent of customers won\u2019t feel the full sticker shock because they qualify for taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\nHHS said nearly three-quarters of customers in 2017 will be able to find a plan for $75 or less per month after that tax credits kick in.\n\n\u201cI know that there has been much talk and discussion about marketplace rate increases this year. But headline rate changes don\u2019t actually reflect what the vast majority of consumers will pay,\u201d HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has said about open enrollment.\n\nYet several million customers do not qualify for government subsidies or purchase insurance off the exchanges, so they will feel the full brunt of the increases.\n\nTaxpayers will also have to shell out more money to cover the subsidies for those who do qualify \u2014 meaning Obamacare\u2019s costs will continue to rise.\n\nOn Monday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to detail just how much of a burden taxpayers are shouldering.\n\n\u201cWhile the administration continues to focus on premium \u2018affordability,\u2019 it ignores the undeniable fact that federal taxpayers are subsidizing these premium increases through tax credits,\u201d wrote Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican and the panel\u2019s chairman, along with other leading members. \u201cThe committee is concerned that the federal taxpayer continues to bear the burden of subsidizing the growing cost of health care insurance.\u201d\n\nAnalysts for months had warned of massive premium increases, saying the Obamacare program is still struggling to entice healthy customers who are needed to make the economics work.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, recently said the law \u201cis no longer affordable for an increasing number of people.\u201d Tennessee Insurance Commissioner Julie McPeak said the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange is \u201cvery near collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that premium increases in the ACA marketplaces are going to be substantially higher in 2017 has been known for months, so there\u2019s no October surprise here,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThe start of open enrollment just means that these increases are becoming more tangible for those consumers who are affected.\u201d\n\nIncreases will vary widely from place to place, though some of the figures are eye-popping: In Arizona, a 27-year-old\u2019s average monthly premium for the second-lowest silver, or \u201cbenchmark,\u201d plan jumps $196 to $422, a 116 percent increase, before subsidies.\n\nIn Oklahoma, that same customer would get a 69 percent increase. Customers in Indiana and Massachusetts, which runs its own exchange, would be the only ones to see a decrease, of 3 percent, according to the HHS report.\n\nThe administration said things could get worse if the federal courts do not overturn a judge\u2019s decision in May that sided with House Republicans, who say the Treasury is unlawfully reimbursing insurers for losses under the 2010 health care overhaul.\n\nIn court papers Monday, the Justice Department said Republicans shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to sue over the cost-sharing program, which is designed to pay back insurers who must help poorer enrollees with out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMillions of Obamacare customers with incomes from 100 percent to 250 percent of the poverty line rely on the payments, and health care plans are required to reduce their out-of-pocket costs, whether they are reimbursed or not.\n\n\u201cIf the government stopped making cost-sharing reduction payments, insurers would still be required by statute to reduce the cost-sharing charges they impose on eligible individuals,\u201d administration attorneys wrote. \u201cInstead of recouping those costs as required by the statute, the insurers would make up the difference by raising their premiums.\u201d\n\nDespite headwinds, Mrs. Burwell is predicting that the marketplace will expand by roughly 1 million customers in 2017 as insurers bring their prices in line with actual costs.\n\nShe estimated that 13.8 million people will buy plans during open enrollment on the exchanges, compared with 12.7 million who initially signed up for 2016.\n\nThat is still short of the 15 million that congressional scorekeepers predicted just a few months ago.\n\nEven Mr. Obama has said his law will need changes after he is out of office, including a government-run plan, or \u201cpublic option,\u201d to bolster competition in the exchanges.\n\nAs it stands, the number of insurers participating on HealthCare.gov has dwindled from 232 this year to 167 in 2017.\n\nHHS said customers on HealthCare.gov, which serves 39 states, will still be able to choose, on average, from 30 plans with different combinations of premiums, out-of-pocket costs, networks of hospitals and physicians, and prescription drug coverage options.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

We don\u2019t want to get ahead of our skis here. We are just as focused on Ohio, Iowa, Florida as we have ever been.\u201d\n\nTrump advisers acknowledge they are facing an uphill battle, but maintain the country\u2019s anti-establishment mood will work in their favour in the final few days.\n\n\u201cWe are behind,\u201d campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told NBC. \u201cShe has some advantages, like $66m in ad buys just in the month of September. She has a former president, happens to be her husband, campaigning for her, and she\u2019s seen as the incumbent.\u201d\n\nConway argued that the electoral map, reshaped by Trump, would benefit the businessman. \u201cOur advantage going in when we\u2019re behind one, three, four points in some of these swing states that Mitt Romney lost to President Obama,\u201d she said, \u201cis that Donald Trump is just going to continue to take the case directly to the people.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t expect to be able to cut through the noise and the way we\u2019re treated by some, so he\u2019s taking the case. He\u2019s going to visit all of these swing states many times and we feel that with Hillary Clinton under 50% in some of these places, even though she has run a very traditional and expensive campaign, that we have a shot of getting those undecided voters.\u201d\n\nEric Trump, the nominee\u2019s son, echoed these sentiments but rejected the idea that his father was playing to his base of support. ABC host George Stephanopoulos pressed the case, asking whether the businessman might be \u201cin a bubble of your own support\u201d. Trump answered: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think so at all.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans are sceptical Trump can find a way to win. Karl Rove, who masterminded George W Bush\u2019s narrow election victories over Al Gore and John Kerry, was sceptical on Sunday that there was enough time left.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it happening,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cMaybe it could, but I doubt, in the just over two weeks we\u2019ve got left and conducting the kind of campaign he is conducting, that he is going to be able to swing one out of every 10 voters.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign remains confident that it can spare resources on punishing the Republican party for standing with Trump, who has repeatedly broken the norms of American politics and energised once shunned leaders, such as former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke.\n\n\u201cI think in general you\u2019re going to hear her do more of what she did [in Pennsylvania] in terms of trying to raise the stakes of the down-ballot races,\u201d Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign, told the Guardian after the secretary spent a day supporting the state\u2019s Democratic Senate candidate, Kate McGinty.\n\nHillary Clinton's record as secretary of state hints at possible presidential role Read more\n\nFallon said the Clinton campaign wanted to \u201cextend an open hand\u201d to traditionally Republican voters even as it targets the \u201cdifferent strain\u201d within the party that continues to support Trump, despite his offensive remarks about women, immigrants and minorities.\n\nAlthough many Senate veterans, including John McCain and Kelly Ayotte, have rescinded their endorsements of Trump, he has retained his vociferous base and the muted support of House speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nFallon said such leaders \u201cshould be held accountable in two and a half weeks, for having played a role in Trump\u2019s rise and for standing by him even after he\u2019s gone around and offended people and shown himself to be completely temperamentally unfit\u201d.\n\nThe aide said Clinton\u2019s campaign would continue to court \u201creasonable Republicans and independents\u201d who might be willing to defect across party lines.\n\nTrump Jr also told ABC that his father would \u201c100%\u201d accept the results of the election if it was fair.\n\n\u201cI think what my father is saying is, \u2018I want a fair election,\u2019\u201d Eric Trump said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cIf it\u2019s a fair outcome, he will absolutely accept it.

In his attempt to put the focus on issues during the home stretch of the campaign, the Republican nominee offered himself as a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d agent of change to revive the economy and stamp out Washington corruption, and he drew a stark contrast between his plan and the more-of-the-same government that he said Mrs. Clinton would run to benefit herself and her cronies.\n\nBut much of Mr. Trump\u2019s pitch was lost as headlines instead focused on his vow to sue the 11 women that have come forward in recent weeks to accuse him of sexual assault. The Republican certainly contributed to such media coverage by calling the women liars and charging that the news media presented their claims \u201cwith virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these liars will be sued when the election is over,\u201d the New York billionaire said in Gettysburg.\n\nMr. Trump said the smears used against him underscore the corrupt power wielded by the political establishment, which he said poses an even greater threat to working Americans.\n\n\u201cIf they can fight somebody like me with unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you \u2014 your jobs, your security, your education, your health care, the violation of religious liberty, the theft of your Second Amendment, the loss of your factories, your homes and much more,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nAs was the case during his final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, debates about issues took a backseat over the weekend. At the debate, his back-and-forth with Mrs. Clinton over gun rights, abortion, and the economy was overshadowed by his refusal to say he\u2019ll accept the results of the Nov. 8 election.\n\nIn the case of his Saturday speech, headlines were dominated by his lawsuit threat, not his detailed policy prescriptions.\n\nTrump campaign officials also have struggled to fend off a growing narrative that says the race is all but over. Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with a significant lead. Surveys also have shown the former first lady ahead in many battleground states, though polls show tight races in Florida, Ohio and other key states.\n\nThe most recent Real Clear Politics average of all polls gives Mrs. Clinton a 6-point edge; other recent polls have given her a double-digit lead.\n\nMrs. Clinton herself clearly believes the race has been won. Over the weekend, she turned much of her fire on Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and other Republicans locked in close re-election battles, hoping to deliver a Democratic landslide that would give the party control of both houses of Congress.\n\nShe made clear she\u2019ll spend little time engaging with Mr. Trump directly and instead will focus on congressional races.\n\n\u201cHe can say whatever he wants to. He can run his campaign however he wants to,\u201d she told reporters after a campaign event in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign insists the polls are wrong and that the race will turn around.\n\nIn an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program on Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the close relationship between some media outlets and the Clinton campaign has resulted in a host of stories claiming the White House contest is finished even though the election is still more than two weeks away.\n\n\u201cWe feel very frustrated. It\u2019s not all members of the media. It\u2019s not even most members of the media, but look at the stories being written now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe path to 270 [electoral votes] is narrow, the path to 270 is over. That is so unfair to the voters who are yet to go to the ballot box and exercise their constitutional rights to tell us who should be president of the United States and commander in chief.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign is actively pushing its supporters to get the polls over the next several weeks during early voting periods and has downplayed the notion that it has the election in the bag.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay focused, and what\u2019s important to us is we don\u2019t want anybody to wake up after election day \u2026 and they didn\u2019t have a chance to participate,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN on Sunday.\n\nAs for his own pitch, Mr. Trump is painting himself as the only candidate in the race capable of delivering change. He called his opponent the very embodiment of a political establishment that he says is rigged against working-class Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking the American people to rise above the noise and clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character, and there is nothing better or stronger than the American character,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton is not running against me. She is running against change and she is running against all the American people and all the American voters.\n\nHe also presented a 100-day \u201caction plan,\u201d which he described as his contract with the American people. It began with an ambitious agenda for his first day in office:\n\n\u2981 Submit a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.\n\n\u2981 Institute a hiring freeze on federal employees to begin thinning the federal workforce through attrition, with exemptions for defense, public health and public safety jobs.\n\n\u2981 Require that every new federal regulation be accompanied by the elimination of two existing regulations.\n\n\u2981 Impose a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyist.\n\n\u2981 Impose a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.\n\n\u2981 Institute a \u201ccomplete ban on foreign lobbyists\u201d raising money for American political campaigns.\n\nMost of the agenda echoed themes from throughout Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, although he added urgency with the timeline for enacting his plans.\n\nMr. Trump also confronted climate change vowing to end billions of dollars in payments to the United Nations climate change program and use the money instead to fix America\u2019s water and environmental infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fix our own environment,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

(The Washington Post)\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump said, \"I'll keep you in suspense,\" when answering a question about the tradition of accepting the results of presidential elections. (The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s defiant assault on the presidential election\u2019s integrity reverberated Thursday among his allies and rivals as the GOP campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s inner circle argued over how best to face the outcome after the votes are counted.\n\nTrump on Wednesday amplified one of the most explosive charges of his candidacy: that if he loses the election, he might consider the results illegitimate because the process is \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nQuestioned directly as to whether he would accept the outcome should Democratic nominee Clinton prevail Nov. 8, Trump demurred. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense,\u201d the Republican nominee said. Clinton called Trump\u2019s answer \u201chorrifying,\u201d saying he was \u201ctalking down our democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated the point after flying to Columbus, Ohio, to campaign Thursday, joking, \u201cI would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2014 if I win.\u201d\n\nHe added later, on a more serious note, \u201cOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result, right?\u201d\n\n[Fact checker: 24 fishy claims]\n\nAt a rally at a downtown Charlotte brewery, one of two to kick off North Carolina\u2019s early voting period, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that Trump\u2019s claims of a \u201crigged\u201d election reminded him of the Third World politicking he had seen as a missionary in Honduras.\n\n\u201cWe have a tradition unbroken back to the beginning of this nation,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t defend our democracy, but he wouldn\u2019t condemn Vladimir Putin\u2019s attempts to tinker with our democracy.\u201d\n\nKaine also used his speech to criticize the Republican-run North Carolina state legislature for passing a voter ID bill that a federal court later overturned after finding evidence of racial discrimination. There was a difference, said Kaine, between legal efforts to extend voting rights and claims of a \u201crigged\u201d election.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a legitimate concern on Election Day, sure, we\u2019re going to let a court figure it out,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nKaine said it was important for the Democratic ticket to win by a large margin. \u201cThe bigger we can win by, the harder it is for him to whine and have anyone believe him,\u201d he said.\n\nA new Clinton fundraising pitch made the same point Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to beat [Trump] so definitively that Hillary\u2019s victory is undeniable,\u201d read the email to donors. \u201cWe need to build up our ground game even more if we want to make that a reality.\u201d\n\n1 of 22 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Memorable quotes from Clinton and Trump\u2019s final presidential debate View Photos Here are some memorable quotes from the presidential debate in Las Vegas.

Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\n[For Trump, strong start and then killer mistake]\n\nEven as the two campaigns exchanged barbs, President Obama and his wife Michelle hit the campaign trail on Clinton\u2019s behalf. The first lady spoke in Phoenix, a sign that Democrats now see traditionally conservative Arizona as a state they could possibly capture this year.\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama delivered a stirring endorsement of \u201cour friend, Hillary\u201d during the campaign rally in Phoenix. She praised men and women from across the country who have written to her in recent days and bemoaned the dark turn the election has taken in recent weeks, blasting Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric.\n\n\u201cLook at us. Just look at us. We all know better, we all know better. Whether we\u2019re Democrats, Republicans or indpendents, it does not matter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all understand that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us. And we know that that is not who we are.\u201d\n\nShe called the 2016 election a \u201ccrossroads\u201d and said that Clinton\u2019s \u201cpowerful\u201d vision of America is backed by \u201cpolicies to make that vision a reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary has comprehensive policies to help people. Her opponent has tweets. You decide,\u201d she said.\n\nThe first lady also blasted Trump for his suggestion Wednesday night that he may not consider the election results legitimate if he loses.\n\n\u201cYou do not keep American democracy in suspense. Because look, too many people have marched and protested and fought and died for this democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the president spoke to a rowdy crowd of about 2,800 in Miami. He said Trump\u2019s suggestion that there\u2019s vote rigging \u201cis more than just the usual lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not a joking matter. That is dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cThat undermines our democracy.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton and Trump made their distaste for each other clear during their last debate, they will find themselves in the same room again Thursday night at the Al Smith charity dinner at New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel. The white-tie dinner, which benefits Catholic charities, is a tradition-bound affair featuring comedic speeches by politicians.\n\nClinton, who arrived in White Plains, N.Y., at 5:30 a.m., has no public events scheduled before then.\n\nAboard her campaign plane Wednesday night, the Democratic nominee attacked Trump\u2019s refusal to say he would accept the election results. \u201cOur country has been around for 240 years, and we\u2019re a country based on laws, and we have hot, contested elections going back to the very beginning. But one of our hallmarks has always been that we accept the outcomes of our election.\u201d\n\nA handful of GOP senators \u2014 including Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake and John McCain \u2014 have criticized Trump\u2019s stance.\n\nMcCain, who lost to President Obama in 2008, said in a statement: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede. A concession isn\u2019t just an act of graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, an act that is every American leader\u2019s first responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe campaign took yet another unexpected turn Thursday morning when Trump suggested that Clinton had gotten the questions to Wednesday\u2019s debate in advance. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Hillary Clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions \u2014 she secretly used them! Crooked Hillary,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMany Republicans have questioned the debate process in the wake of a recent WikiLeaks revelation that interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile may have shared a question in advance of a CNN town hall in March. In an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Brazile \u2014 a CNN contributor at the time \u2014 wrote, \u201cFrom time to time I get the questions in advance,\u201d and highlighted the issue of the death penalty.\n\n[Then-CNN contributor Donna Brazile to Clinton camp: Sometimes \u2018I get the questions in advance\u2019]\n\nClinton received a question right along those same lines the next day.\n\nTrump picked up on that theme during his Columbus speech, saying his opponent received \u201cthe exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile, who is now under tremendous pressure to resign from the DNC, as she should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is cheating at the highest level,\u201d he said, as the crowd booed at the mention of Brazile\u2019s name. \u201cBut I ask you, why shouldn\u2019t Hillary Clinton resign from the race?\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Fox host Megyn Kelly on Wednesday night, Brazile rejected the allegations of improper collusion with the Clinton campaign.\n\n\u201cI am not going to try to validate falsified information,\u201d she said. \u201cI do my homework, I communicate, I talk. CNN has never provided me with questions.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s supporters were also circulating a different debate theory on social media Thursday: that the glow emanating from a screen on Clinton\u2019s lectern proved she was learning Fox moderator Chris Wallace\u2019s questions in advance.\n\nThe Democratic nominee quickly turned the accusation into a fundraising pitch, retweeting it with the line, \u201cShow Trump his tweets come at a cost \u2014 because Hillary supporters are pledging to donate every time he tweets.\u201d\n\nThe sparring between the two camps came after the two parties\u2019 candidates got into fiery exchanges over their fitness to serve as president and character traits Wednesday night.\n\nBut over the course of the third and final debate, they delved deeper into their substantive differences than they did in the first two forums and offered a clearer contrast in the directions they would take the country. They drew sharp distinctions on the economy, trade, terrorism, immigration and hot-button social issues including abortion and guns.\n\n[Where Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton stand on the issues]\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin loomed as an unseen third presence onstage. Clinton and Trump sparred over which of them would be more effective as commander in chief in dealing with his aggression and Russian cyberattacks. Clinton labeled Trump as Putin's \u201cpuppet\u201d \u2014 prompting Trump to snap back, \u201cYou\u2019re the puppet!\u201d \u2014 while Trump charged that Putin had \u201coutsmarted and outplayed\u201d her when she was secretary of state.\n\nAfter Clinton cited the findings of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government had committed espionage \u2014 including by hacking Pdesta\u2019s emails \u2014 to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump said he did not agree with that conclusion.\n\n\u201cHillary, you have no idea,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur country has no idea.\u201d\n\nRucker reported from Las Vegas.

But it comes at an especially tumultuous time in the campaign.\n\nI have no doubt about Wallace\u2019s ability to ask fair, probing questions of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Well before I came to Fox, I believed that he was one of the toughest interviewers in the business. He has a wealth of experience to draw upon, including his previous stints at NBC and ABC, going back to his coverage of the Reagan White House.\n\nThird debates usually matter less than the first two. The candidates have usually thrown their best stuff at each other and wind up recycling many of their attacks.\n\nBut this is not most campaigns.\n\nWallace told me after he became the first Fox journalist tapped to moderate a general-election debate that he\u2019d have to wait in writing most of the questions to see what was covered in the first two faceoffs. Turns out a whole lot has happened since St. Louis.\n\nThe final encounter comes as Trump is denying allegations of sexual misconduct by nine women, and whether they are telling the truth or not, this changes the environment more drastically than Trump merely boasting about groping women on a tape he has dismissed as locker-room talk. And Trump has been increasingly at war with Paul Ryan, talking and tweeting about voter fraud, and accusing the media of rigging the election.\n\nThe debate also comes as a near-daily drip of disclosures from Wikileaks \u2013 and newly released FBI files from her email investigation -- causes more damage to the Clinton campaign. This goes beyond embarrassing comments and coziness with journalists to collusion with the State Department (including talk of a quid pro quo in exchange for changing the secret designation for some of the emails sent from Clinton\u2019s private server).\n\nThese stories hang like a shadow over the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nBut while I assume that Wallace will deal with those stories fairly early, he also has the responsibility of tackling trade, terrorism, taxes and other issues that affect hundreds of millions of Americans. These subjects are too important to get short shrift in favor of the more scandalous and salacious stuff.\n\nThis is the last time for Trump and Clinton to make their case before a mass audience when it comes to persuading voters, but also in attacking their opponents and fending off the broadsides that come their way.\n\nBeyond the zingers and tough exchanges, the debates always come down to which candidate can make more Americans feel comfortable with the prospect of him or her siting in the Oval Office and acting as their champion. The polls show that questionable temperament is Trump\u2019s greatest liability and dishonesty is Clinton\u2019s biggest albatross.\n\nNo matter what he does, if the past is any indication, Wallace will draw criticism from partisans on both sides.\n\nBut as he told me, he is there to facilitate a debate between two people, one of whom will be the next president.

Janice D. Schakowsky, Illinois Democrat, stepped down from the campaign Tuesday, a day after Scott Foval was fired from his post as national field director of Americans United for Change.\n\nMr. Trump, who has long complained of a \u201crigged\u201d election system, said at a Tuesday rally in Colorado that the video released by the conservative group Project Veritas Action confirmed his suspicions of Democrat-sponsored political chicanery.\n\n\u201cThe protesters are paid a lot of money by the [Democratic National Committee], and they kept saying, \u2018I wonder why those people are here, because they never seem to have much on their mind other than stand up and protest,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs. \u201cAnd yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it\u2019s all over the internet. They were busted.\u201d\n\nBrad Woodhouse, Americans United for Change president, said in a late-Monday statement that Mr. Foval \u201cis no longer associated with Americans United for Change.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the Democratic political consulting firm has \u201calways operated according to the highest ethical and legal standards.\u201d\n\nMr. Creamer, a four-decade Democratic strategist who pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of bank fraud and tax violations, said in a statement that he was \u201cunwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a temporary regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer with us,\u201d said Mr. Creamer, who is also featured in the videos.\n\nThe two 16-minute videos were released Monday and Tuesday after a yearlong undercover investigation headed by Project Veritas\u2019 James O\u2019Keefe, known for his hidden-camera probes into Planned Parenthood, ACORN and voter fraud.\n\nMr. O\u2019Keefe said the investigation reveals \u201ccompelling evidence of a dark-money conspiracy\u201d and that he would continue to release videos as part of a series titled \u201cRigging the Election\u201d until voters go to the polls on Nov. 8.\n\nThe first video shows Democratic strategists discussing how they hire agitators \u2014 including union members, homeless people and the mentally ill \u2014 to incite violence by provoking Trump supporters on camera at campaign stops.\n\nProject Veritas released a second video Tuesday showing Mr. Foval brainstorming over ways to commit voter fraud, such as by busing people from one state to another, while appearing to indicate that it had already been done in Iowa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty easy thing for Republicans to say, \u2018Well, they\u2019re busing people in,\u2019\u201d Mr. Foval said. \u201cWell, you know what? We\u2019ve been busing people in to deal with you f\u2013ing assholes for 50 years, and we\u2019re not going to stop now. We\u2019re just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If they needed people, there we\u2019d bus people out to Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe same video shows Mr. Creamer discussing a proposal by a Project Veritas investigator to register people to vote illegally by setting up a shell corporation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to write down these options,\u201d Mr. Creamer said. \u201cLet me see if I can chat with the people who are most involved in Hispanic voter registration.\u201d\n\nMr. Foval, who has worked for the George Soros-funded People for the American Way, said his paid agitators fueled a Chicago protest in March that forced the Trump campaign to cancel its event.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re starting confrontations in the line, right?\u201d said Mr. Foval. \u201cThey\u2019re not starting confrontations in the rally. Because once they\u2019re inside the rally, they\u2019re under Secret Service\u2019s control. When they\u2019re outside the rally, the media will cover it no matter where it happens. The key is initiating the conflict by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic.\u201d\n\nInciting Trump supporters was easy, he said.\n\n\u201cI mean, honestly, it\u2019s not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off,\u201d Mr. Foval said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt. Or, \u2018Trump is a Nazi,\u2019 you know. You can message to draw them out and draw them to punch you.\u201d\n\nAnother operative, Aaron Black, who identified himself as \u201cdeputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground,\u201d said he was with Mr. Creamer\u2019s group Democracy Partners but that his work was supposed to be a secret.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s really supposed to know about me,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cSo the Chicago protest, when they shut all that, that was us. It was more [Mr. Creamer] than me, but none of this is supposed to come back to us because we want it coming from people. We don\u2019t want it to come from the party.\u201d\n\nHe said the idea is for the protests to appear spontaneous, not orchestrated by the DNC.\n\n\u201cSo if we do a protest and if it\u2019s branded a DNC protest, right away the press is going to say, \u2018partisan,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Black, also known as \u201cAaron Minter,\u201d according to the video.\n\n\u201cBut if I\u2019m in there coordinating with all the groups on the ground and sort of playing field general but they are the ones talking to the cameras, then it\u2019s actually people, but if we send out press advisories with DNC on them and Clinton campaign, it just doesn\u2019t have the same effect,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same day the video was released, Mr. Black posted a photo on Twitter showing protesters outside Trump Tower holding signs with messages such as, \u201cTrump Demeans Women.\u201d\n\nKeeping the protesters\u2019 connection to the DNC hidden from the press was a priority, Mr. Foval said.\n\n\u201cWe have to be really careful because what we don\u2019t need is for it to show up on CNN that the DNC paid for X people to \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. O\u2019Keefe said the first video raises questions about whether the Clinton campaign is coordinating with super PACs and independent expenditure committees in violation of campaign finance rules.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, DNC, Americans United for Change and Democracy Partners did not return requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nThe only public criticism of the videos has come from foes of Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s past work such as Salon\u2019s Brendan Gauthier, who said Project Veritas has been criticized for \u201cstrategically editing footage to make false accusations.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Mr. Foval made clear his connections to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign both. I am contracted to [Mr. Creamer]. But I answer to the head of special events for the DNC and the head of special events and political for the campaign,\u201d said Mr. Foval.\n\nHe goes on to say, \u201cThe campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, the Foval Group goes and executes the sh\u2014 on the ground.\u201d\n\nMr. Creamer indicated that he was in close contact with the Clinton campaign, saying, \u201cWe have a call with the campaign every day to go over the focuses that need to be undertaken.\u201d\n\n\u201cWherever Trump and Pence are going to be, we have events,\u201d Mr. Creamer said. \u201cAnd we have a whole team across the country that does that. Both consultants and people from the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party apparatus and people from the campaign, the Clinton campaign. And my role in the campaign is to manage all that.\u201d\n\nAnother activist, Zulema Rodriguez, told the Project Veritas investigators, \u201cI just had a call today with the campaign and the DNC. Every day at 1 o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nShe also took credit for being involved with two anti-Trump events in March: the Chicago rally and another in Arizona in which anti-Trump protesters blocked a highway.\n\nFederal Election Commission records unearthed by Project Veritas show that Ms. Rodriguez was paid nearly $2,000 on Feb. 29 by the Hillary for America campaign.\n\nIn conversations with Project Veritas reporters, Mr. Foval described his operation as \u201cbird dogging,\u201d meaning that he places hired protesters in key positions at Republican campaign events, often in front of rallies or lines.\n\nHe said he has training centers in New York, Washington, Las Vegas, Colorado and Minneapolis, and that trainees include the mentally ill and homeless people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying we have mentally ill people that we pay to do sh\u2014, make no mistake,\u201d Mr. Foval said. \u201cOver the last 20 years. I\u2019ve paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff, and I\u2019ve also taken them for dinner and I\u2019ve also made sure they had a hotel and a shower and I\u2019ve put them in a program. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\nHe also has contacts with unions such as the AFL-CIO. \u201cBut the reality is, a lot of people, especially our union guys, a lot of union guys, they\u2019ll do whatever you want,\u201d Mr. Foval said. \u201cThey\u2019re rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201d\n\nMr. Foval also made it clear that he viewed Mr. Creamer as a mentor.\n\n\u201cI work for Bob Creamer one to one,\u201d Mr. Foval said in the video. \u201cI\u2019m the white hat. Democracy Partners is kind of dark hat. Bob Creamer is diabolical, and I love him for it.\u201d\n\n(Note: Graphic language in the video.)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump and other Republicans nonetheless quickly seized on the new documents as evidence of what Speaker Paul D. Ryan called \u201ca cover-up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s latest release of 100 pages of internal investigative files prolonged the intense public scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which has been perhaps more damaging to her presidential campaign than any other issue.\n\nThe new documents also cast particular attention on the role of Mr. Kennedy, a State Department civil servant for more than four decades, in working to oversee the review and public release of tens of thousands of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private emails.\n\nOne of the F.B.I. reports said State Department employees who reviewed nearly 300 of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails on the Benghazi attacks in early 2015 in response to requests from Congress had \u201cfelt intense pressure\u201d from Mr. Kennedy and other senior State Department officials to complete their review quickly and \u201cnot label anything as classified.\u201d\n\nMr. Kennedy was part of a long-running battle between the State Department and the intelligence agencies over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. As the emails were prepared for release, officials from the intelligence agencies argued in some cases that information in them should have been marked classified, while State Department officials countered that they contained the routine business of American diplomacy. State Department officials, who argue that the intelligence agencies are overzealous in classifying information, remain sensitive to criticism that they were sloppy in handling the material.\n\nIn one of the newly disclosed documents, an unidentified F.B.I. employee told investigators that Mr. Kennedy, through another F.B.I. official, had sought in one case \u201cassistance in altering the email\u2019s classification in exchange for a \u2018quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe F.B.I. had deemed the email classified, but the State Department disagreed.\n\nThe employee told investigators that \u201cin exchange for marking the email unclassified, State would reciprocate by allowing the F.B.I. to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden,\u201d according to the F.B.I.\u2019s summary of the employee\u2019s questioning by investigators.\n\nA second F.B.I. interview included in the documents provides a somewhat different version of the dispute over the classification of the Benghazi email, with the suggestion that the F.B.I. \u2014 and not Mr. Kennedy \u2014 had offered to make a deal.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Roebuck, who oversaw the department\u2019s office for North Africa and is now the American ambassador to Bahrain.\n\nIn it, he notified five other officials of the arrest of \u201cseveral people\u201d in Libya on suspicion they were connected with the Benghazi attack two months earlier. It was subsequently forwarded to senior officials at the department and then to Mrs. Clinton on her private email account by her deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan, with a short \u201cf.y.i.\u201d note.\n\nMark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said that no favors had been exchanged in the discussions of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, and that there had been no change in the number of agents in Iraq as a result of the conversations. \u201cThe allegation of any kind of quid pro quo is inaccurate and does not align with the facts,\u201d Mr. Toner said.\n\nThe F.B.I. also said there was \u201cnever a quid pro quo,\u201d but it said the accusations had been referred to the bureau\u2019s inspection division, which handles internal ethics issues, to investigate. The F.B.I. official who discussed the issue with Mr. Kennedy has since left the bureau, an official said.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers, Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the documents provided \u201cundeniable proof\u201d that Mrs. Clinton had \u201ccolluded with the F.B.I., D.O.J. and State Department to cover up criminal activity at the highest levels.\u201d\n\nTwo prominent members of the House \u2014 Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \u2014 called on Secretary of State John Kerry to relieve Mr. Kennedy of his position pending an investigation.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Kerry, they accused Mr. Kennedy, the State Department and the F.B.I. of collusion.

Respondents were also asked about Donald Trump's lewd comments about women, and how locked-in their votes are. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nWith three weeks until Election Day, Hillary Clinton holds a four-point lead over Donald Trump in the race for the White House, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, with the Republican nominee hobbled by persistent perceptions that he is not qualified to be president.\n\nThe poll was conducted during one of the most tumultuous periods of Trump\u2019s candidacy, after the release of a video in which he spoke about taking sexual advantage of women and during a time when numerous women have accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nNearly 7 in 10 respondents believe Trump probably made unwanted sexual advances, and a majority say his apology for boasts about forcing himself on women on a hot-mic videotape was insincere. Nonetheless, the controversy appeared to have had only a minimal impact on his overall support.\n\nOverall, Clinton leads Trump by 47-43 percent among likely voters, a slight edge given the survey\u2019s four-percentage-point error margin. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson has the support of 5 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein is at 2 percent. Among registered voters, the poll shows a similar four-point margin, with Clinton at 44, Trump at 40, Johnson at 6 and Stein at 3. In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 50-46 percent among likely voters and by 50-44 percent among registered voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current findings show only slight changes from the last Post-ABC survey, which was taken on the eve of the first presidential debate. At that time, Clinton held an insignificant two-point edge over Trump among likely voters. The findings are somewhat better for Trump than other polls taken since the video, but if Clinton were to maintain such an advantage until Election Day, that could translate into a sizable electoral college majority.\n\nSupporters of both candidates are locked in, with 88 percent of Trump supporters and 89 percent of Clinton backers saying they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d support their current preference.\n\nThe survey also underscored the hardening of the lines between those supporting Trump and those who are not. One question in particular highlighted this divide. Asked whether it was appropriate for Trump to say that, if he were in charge of law enforcement in this country, his opponent would be in jail for her use of a private email server, about 4 in 10 likely voters said yes, compared with 57 percent who said no. More than 7 in 10 Republicans and more than 8 in 10 Trump supporters called the language appropriate.\n\nThere is clearly less enthusiasm on the part of Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s supporters than previous nominees have enjoyed at this stage of the campaign. Fully 83 percent of Clinton\u2019s backers and 79 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters say they are very or somewhat enthusiastic about their candidate. Four years ago at this time, more than 90 percent of both President Obama\u2019s and Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s supporters described themselves as enthusiastic.\n\nMeanwhile, antipathy toward the other side is at extremely high levels, as 87 percent of likely voters supporting Trump have a \u201cstrongly unfavorable\u201d view of Clinton, and 90 percent of Clinton backers have a strong negative view of Trump.\n\nThe Oct. 7 release of the 11-year-old \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video, which captured Trump on a hot mic speaking in crude and degrading ways about women, brought a torrent of criticism on Trump and caused significant defections among Republican elected officials.\n\nTrump issued a series of statements apologizing for what he said on the video, but nearly 6 in 10 likely voters say they do not think the apology was sincere, including more than one-fifth of Republicans and more than 6 in 10 independents. The poll also finds that slightly more than a third of all likely voters say the video will make them less likely to vote for him, including 13 percent of Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump denied during the second presidential debate that he had ever engaged in the kind of behavior he talked about in the video. He held that position when confronted days later by accusations from multiple women who said he had groped them.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll indicates that an overwhelming majority of likely voters doubt those denials, with 68 percent saying Trump probably has made unwanted sexual advances on women and 14 percent saying he probably has not. Almost half of Republicans think he has probably engaged in such behavior, while 22 percent say he has not, and the rest have no opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump repeatedly tried to brush aside his comments as \u201clocker room banter.\u201d Asked whether his comments are typical of locker room talk among men, just more than 4 in 10 likely voters said yes, while 52 percent said it was \u201cbeyond how men typically talk.\u201d\n\nThere was little difference in the way men and women answered this question: About 4 in 10 men and 4 in 10 women say this is typical locker room talk. There was a significant variance among white voters based on levels of education, however, with 53 percent of whites without college degrees calling it typical and 55 percent of whites with college degrees saying it went beyond typical conversation among men.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs he has come under criticism on the issue of his treatment of women, Trump has countered by pointing to Bill Clinton, saying that what the former president did and has been accused of doing regarding women is far worse. Trump also has accused Hillary Clinton of intimidating her husband\u2019s accusers.\n\nThis line of attack finds support among only a minority of voters. When asked to compare the two issues \u2014 Trump\u2019s vs. Bill Clinton\u2019s treatment of women or what Hillary Clinton did on behalf of her husband \u2014 there is no equivalence. While 55 percent say the issue of Trump\u2019s treatment of women is a legitimate issue in the campaign, 62 percent say what Hillary Clinton may have done is not a legitimate issue, and 67 percent say Bill Clinton\u2019s treatment is not a legitimate issue.\n\nBoth Clinton and Trump are viewed unfavorably by majorities of Americans. Clinton\u2019s current net negative is 14 points (42 percent favorable and 56 percent unfavorable), while Trump\u2019s is 25 points (37 percent favorable and 62 percent unfavorable).\n\nAt the same time, neither is viewed as honest and trustworthy, with 60 percent of likely voters saying Clinton is not and 62 percent saying Trump is not.\n\nA slight majority (52 percent) say Clinton does not have strong moral character, and a much larger 66 percent say Trump does not have it. On these questions, there are significant and predictable partisan differences in perceptions of the candidates, yet 30 percent of likely voters who support Trump say he doesn\u2019t have a strong moral character. Three times as many of his supporters say Clinton lacks it.\n\nOn two other attributes, however, Clinton is viewed positively and Trump is viewed negatively, and these help to highlight the obstacles that remain in Trump\u2019s path as he attempts to make up ground lost over the past month.\n\nSix in 10 say Clinton is qualified to be president, consistent with views of her readiness over many months. Meanwhile, almost 6 in 10 (57 percent) of likely voters say Trump is not qualified, also a level that has moved little through the course of the general election.\n\nOn the question of fitness \u2014 who has the kind of personality and temperament to serve as president \u2014 there is a similar mismatch between the candidates. Almost 6 in 10 likely voters say Clinton has the right temperament, while 62 percent say Trump does not.\n\nTrump also has no advantage in trust to handle a series of major campaign issues. He is roughly even with Clinton in trust to handle the economy, terrorism and immigration, but he trails on handling ethics in government and by large margins on dealing with an international crisis, advocating women\u2019s rights and looking out for the middle class.\n\nPerceptions of Trump on these issues and attributes have changed only a little in the aftermath of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video, in part perhaps because he was judged so negatively before the video became public. Taken together, the findings on these questions point to what could be a hard ceiling in Trump\u2019s support, which he so far has been unable to change. Republicans have urged him for months to become more disciplined and to demonstrate greater stability as a candidacy.\n\nHis last big opportunity to do so will come on Wednesday when he and Clinton meet in Las Vegas for their final debate. Many Republicans said after the second debate that Trump had done well in making his arguments as a change candidate while portraying Clinton as part of a failed status quo. But at 45 percent to 33 percent, more likely voters say Clinton prevailed in the town hall debate in St. Louis.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll was conducted Oct. 10-13 among a random national sample of 1,152 adults reached on cellular and landline phones. The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus three percentage points; the margin of error is 3.5 points among the sample of 920 registered voters and four points among the sample of 740 likely voters.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/10/12/Others/Images/2016-10-11/clinton341476238272.jpg", "title": "Washington Post-ABC News poll: Clinton holds four-point lead in aftermath of Trump tape", "summary": "Almost 6 in 10 likely voters say Clinton has the right temperament, while 62 percent say Trump does not.\nBut at 45 percent to 33 percent, more likely voters say Clinton prevailed in the town hall debate in St. Louis.\nThe newest Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Democratic presidential Hillary Clinton with a 4-percentage-point lead over Republican nominee Donald Trump among likely voters.\nA slight majority (52 percent) say Clinton does not have strong moral character, and a much larger 66 percent say Trump does not have it.\nIn a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 50-46 percent among likely voters and by 50-44 percent among registered voters.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Scott Clement Is The Polling Manager At The Washington Post Specializing In Public Opinion About Politics Election Campaigns Public Policy", "Dan Balz Is Chief Correspondent At The Washington Post He Has Served As The Paper S National Editor Political Editor White House Correspondent Southwest Correspondent"], "keywords": ["saying", "video", "clinton", "trump", "lead", "voters", "holds", "washington", "likely", "say", "tape", "trumps", "women", "aftermath", "poll", "postabc", "fourpoint"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-14 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-apprentice-contestant-accuses-trump-of-groping-her-during-job-meeting/2016/10/14/931c2dfe-9240-11e6-a6a3-d50061aa9fae_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_apprenticeaccuser-6pm%3Ahomepage/story", "text": "A former contestant on the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on Friday accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts during a 2007 meeting to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization.\n\nSummer Zervos, who appeared on the show in 2006 and now owns a California restaurant, spoke about the incident at a news conference alongside civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred.\n\nAt times tearing up, Zervos said the incident occurred at Trump\u2019s bungalow hotel suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel, which she visited after he suggested the two have dinner.\n\nZervos said Trump greeted her with an \u201copen-mouthed kiss\u201d and then urged her to sit close to him on a love seat before kissing her again, groping her and trying to pull her into his bedroom. Zervos said she pushed Trump away and told him, \u201cCome on, man, get real.\u201d\n\nShe said Trump responded by mimicking her words, \u201cGet real,\u201d and \u201cthrusting his genitals\u201d in her direction.\n\nSummer Zervos, a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d says Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump kissed and groped her without her consent when she approached him about a job in 2007. (Reuters)\n\nZervos\u2019s accusations came as a number of other women have stepped forward in recent days to accuse Trump of groping them or kissing them inappropriately. Also Friday, The Washington Post published the account of Kristin Anderson, 46, who said Trump reached up her skirt and groped her during an encounter at a nightclub in the early 1990s.\n\n[Woman says Trump reached under her skirt and groped her in early 1990s]\n\nIn a statement, Trump said he \u201cvaguely\u201d remembered Zervos as an \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant but that he \u201cnever met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not what I am as a person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life,\u201d he said, adding that Zervos had emailed him in April asking that he visit her restaurant in California. Trump blasted the media, saying reporters are \u201cthrowing due diligence and fact-finding to the side in a rush to file their stories first,\u201d a sign, he said that \u201cwe truly are living in a broken system.\u201d\n\nTrump has categorically denied other accusations. At a rally in North Carolina, he called the women\u2019s accounts \u201ctotal fiction.\u201d He called Jessica Leeds, who told the New York Times that Trump had groped her on an airplane in the 1980s, \u201cthat horrible woman\u201d and suggested Leeds was not attractive enough to have drawn his interest. \u201cBelieve me, she would not be my first choice,\u201d he said.\n\nZervos, like the other women who have lodged allegations in recent days, said she was compelled to speak after watching a video of Trump bragging to \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d in 2005 that he was able to sexually assault women because he is a celebrity.\n\nAllred said Zervos is one of \u201cmany\u201d women who have approached her in recent days to describe experiences with Trump. Allred said several friends and family members of Zervos could corroborate that she had told them of her experiences with Trump shortly after they allegedly occurred, but Allred did not release those statements Friday.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump mocked Jessica Leeds, who accused Trump of putting his hand up her skirt on an airplane decades ago during a rally in Greensboro, N.C. (The Washington Post)\n\nZervos read aloud from the email she said that she sent Trump in April 2016, which she said was an attempt to see whether the increasingly high-profile presidential candidate would consider apologizing for his behavior. She said she wrote to Trump, through an assistant, that his behavior toward her \u201cblew my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been in\u00adcred\u00adibly hurt by our previous interaction,\u201d she said she wrote. She said she received no response.\n\nUnlike several other of Trump\u2019s accusers, who either barely knew the business executive or did not know him at all, Zervos said she had considered Trump a mentor and role model, even after she was fired from the boardroom game show.\n\nShe said she reached out to him a year after her \u201cApprentice\u201d appearance when she was traveling to New York and asked to meet to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization.\n\nIn his Trump Tower office, she said Trump was complimentary and sounded eager to hire her. Then, she said, she became uncomfortable when, as she was leaving, he kissed her on the mouth.\n\nZervos said she shared the experience at the time with a friend and her parents, who urged her to view the kiss as a form of greeting. Not long after, she said Trump called her to say he was visiting California and suggested the two have dinner to discuss the job.\n\nZervos said Trump became physical soon after she arrived at his suite in the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\n\u201cHe put me in an embrace, and I tried to push him away,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter she rejected his advances, Zervos said, Trump grew cold. She said they proceeded with their planned dinner and that Trump ordered a club sandwich for the two to share.\n\nAs they waited for dinner to arrive, Zervos recalled that Trump told her that \u201che did not think I had ever known love or had ever been in love.\u201d Over dinner, he offered financial advice, suggesting that she should stop paying the mortgage on her home, leave the keys on a table and demand the bank make her a better deal, she said.\n\nTrump soon said he was tired and urged her to leave, Zervos said. He did not cut off discussions of a possible job. Instead he suggested they meet the next day at his Rancho Palos Verdes golf course, where she was given a tour by the general manager. Ultimately, she said she was offered a job that paid half of what she had discussed with Trump.\n\nAllred said Zervos has no plans to file a lawsuit and has no affiliation with any political campaign.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to sleep at night when I\u2019m 70,\u201d Zervos said to explain her decision to come forward.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/10/14/National-Politics/Images/Campaign_2016-bcbbe.jpg", "title": "Former \u2018Apprentice\u2019 contestant accuses Trump of groping her during job meeting", "summary": "A former contestant on the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on Friday accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts during a 2007 meeting to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization.\nSummer Zervos, a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d says Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump kissed and groped her without her consent when she approached him about a job in 2007.\nUltimately, she said she was offered a job that paid half of what she had discussed with Trump.\nNot long after, she said Trump called her to say he was visiting California and suggested the two have dinner to discuss the job.\n(Reuters)Zervos\u2019s accusations came as a number of other women have stepped forward in recent days to accuse Trump of groping them or kissing them inappropriately.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Rosalind Helderman Is A Political Enterprise Investigations Reporter For The Washington Post"], "keywords": ["suggested", "women", "accuses", "trump", "dinner", "groping", "job", "zervos", "contestant", "groped", "told", "meeting", "presidential", "apprentice"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-14 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-utah-mormons-morality-dilemma-2016/index.html", "text": "\"It's like choosing between getting shot or poisoned,\" he said in a back hall of the Utah State Capitol building. \"We know that Hillary Clinton is the worst, most horrifying and certainly lethal poison known to man.

They're terrible, terrible people,' that's a really broad brush that I think most members of the Mormon Church, and many, many other faiths, find to be terribly, terribly offensive.\"\n\nMorality vs. politics\n\nWho is to say whether moral judgments should take precedence over political ones, or vice-versa? It's two faiths competing. Neither is remotely unimportant; neither can be dismissed.\n\n\"The church's own scripture, and teachings from the church leaders would suggest that one of the things that's paramount to consider when you are choosing a candidate is their morality -- their personal morality -- their level of honesty; that they need to be a good person, a good human being,\" said Quin Monson, a political science professor at Brigham Young University in Provo.\n\nMonson isn't just a professor -- he's Mormon and has voted for Republicans his entire life, a streak that will end on November 8.\n\n\"Every time (Trump) chooses to interact publicly, he almost can't help but interact in a way that I think many Mormons, if not most Mormons, would find troubling and antithetical or opposite of who they are, who they are at least taught to be,\" he said.\n\nMonson will vote for Clinton or for third-party candidate Evan McMullin, who is surging in the polls here, but who is on the ballot in less than a dozen states.\n\n\"I'm more confident than ever before that Donald Trump will lose Utah,\" Monson said.\n\n'I am not electing an ecclesiastical leader'\n\nKathleen Anderson lives a bit further up in the Bountiful hills from David Irvine. A lifelong Republican as well, she's the president of the Utah Federation of Republican Women.\n\nUnlike Irvine, she has a Trump yard sign -- a new one because the first was vandalized with spray paint.\n\nAnderson's family converted to the LDS church when she was seven years old, and she calls it \"a good fit\" for her. She's more forgiving of Trump's style and moral compass than other Mormons.\n\n\"Donald Trump probably does not espouse all of my values,\" she said. \"However, I am not electing an ecclesiastical leader at this point. I'm electing a leader for this country who can right policies that have gone astray.\"\n\nAnderson knows other members of her faith are morally repulsed by Trump.\n\n\"Some people might find him vulgar, offensive, greedy. Many other qualities that are reprehensible.\"\n\nBut, she said, \"I think to hold everyone to the same standard is incorrect and unfair. I was most likely raised with a different set of values than Donald Trump was.\"\n\n\"When we make a mistake, we very much want other people to grant us mercy, or grace, or forgiveness,\" Anderson said. \"When they do, we are so appreciative of that. Yet, it is so easy, it appears, for people to not extend that same grace or mercy, or forgiveness, to someone else who has made a mistake. Rather, we pass this judgment, and I don't think that judgment is always fair.\"\n\nThe agony\n\nBack at the state capitol, Thatcher sounds like he is already in excruciating agony.\n\n\"Voting for Hillary Clinton, to my mind, is morally repugnant,\" he said. \"Voting for Donald Trump, in my mind, is morally repugnant. And I am still not sure which one's worse.\"\n\nBut will Trump hold off Clinton and win?\n\n\"50-50,\" he said.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161013205001-trump-clinton-utah-mormons-2016-00010919-super-tease.jpg", "title": "Mormons offended by Trump could upend two-party tradition", "summary": "For Irvine, morality trumps politics -- so Clinton trumps Trump.\n\"\"There are a lot of people in Utah who are members of the Mormon faith, the Mormon Church, who are undocumented immigrants from who knows where.\n\"The history of Mormons in Utah is one of persecution, one of being hunted down,\" he said.\nUnlike Irvine, she has a Trump yard sign -- a new one because the first was vandalized with spray paint.\n\"I'm more confident than ever before that Donald Trump will lose Utah,\" Monson said.", "source": "CNN", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Jeff Simon"], "keywords": ["upend", "clinton", "trump", "political", "twoparty", "utah", "think", "mormons", "offended", "mormon", "trumps", "church", "republican", "tradition"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-13 00:00:00", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/10/13/deluge-two-more-women-now-allege-trump-groping-incidents-n2231550", "text": "On Friday, the tape came out. On Saturday and Sunday, Trump allies and others warned that there was more to come. And so here we are. The Republican presidential nominee's campaign is in chaos, fending off allegations from four separate women -- all going public on the same day, \"coincidentally\" -- that he fondled, kissed, or groped them without their consent. The alleged incidents date as far back as the 1980's, through as recently as 2013. None of these women went to the authorities at the time, but all have friends or family who confirm that they reported the episodes contemporaneously. Matt told you about the New York Times report last night. As those accusations entered the media bloodstream, more pieces dropped. A Yahoo! News story links to a Facebook post from a 2013 Miss Universe contestant who describes Trump's degrading treatment of the women in the pageant, later commenting that Trump \"continually grabbed my ass\" during the process. She is daring Trump to sue her, saying that she has \"worse stories\" she could share. Separately, here's a Florida allegation via the Palm Beach Post:\n\nFor more than 10 years, it was something Mindy McGillivray said she shared only with a close circle of family and friends. That changed Sunday night. Donald Trump was asked during the presidential debate about when he bragged that he kissed women without their consent and grabbed their genitals \u2013 remarks captured on audio that surfaced last week. Trump apologized for the remarks and dismissed them as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d But the debate moderator, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to clarify: \u201cHave you ever done those things?\u201d \u201cNo, I have not,\" Trump replied. Watching at home in Palm Springs, McGillivray said she rose from her couch and yelled at the TV screen: \u2018You liar!\u2019 McGillivray, 36, said she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago 13 years ago. She said she never reported it to authorities. But her companion that day, photographer Ken Davidoff, vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, \"Donald just grabbed my ass!\"\n\nThese women's stories come in addition to the two women quoted in Wednesday's New York Times report, one of whom reported unwelcome kissing; the other, an up-the-skirt groping on an airplane by Mr. Trump. This brings the total of women accusing Trump of unwanted physical touching to six, by my unofficial count, including another pageant participant (\"he kissed me directly on the lips\") and a writer for People magazine (\"he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat\"). Besieged by allegations they call untrue, Trump's team is reportedly mulling lawsuits against various media outlets. But there are a few problems here. First, some of these women have told the same consistent story in private for years, which lends credibility to their claims. Second, and most damning, they are telling the world that Donald Trump did to them...precisely the sort of thing he is on tape saying he does to women:\n\nBiggest problem for Trump amid new allegations: He said on tape this is what he does to women. \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 12, 2016\n\n\"Just kiss,\" he told Billy Bush in 2005, explaining his attitudes on making sexual advances. \"When you're a star...you can do anything. Grab them by the p***sy.\" Lawsuits will draw even more attention to the story, and Trump is very likely to lose in court, if he even pulls the trigger because the standard for proving libel of a public figure is quite high. And in the court of public opinion, Trump's own words add to the plausibility -- if not probability -- of his accusers' stories. Ever since he flatly denied that he'd ever followed through on the actions mentioned in his so-called \"locker room talk\" during a nationally-televised presidential debate on Sunday, women began coming out of the woodwork. These details come in addition to yet more tales of Trump's conduct, including barging in on naked beauty pageant contestants -- some as young as 15 -- in their changing rooms, which he later boastingly confirmed in interviews with Howard Stern. And there's this old chestnut dug up by CBS News, in which a 46-year-old Trump charmingly tells a group of ten-year-old girls that he'll be dating one of them in a decade:\n\nThat's little more than a creepy joke, but it's not the first time Trump has talked about young girls in the context of their future sexuality -- including this mind-bogglingly appalling comment about his own daughter, who was an infant at the time. (Seriously, what the hell is wrong with this man?) By the way, the clip above comes courtesy of the same CBS News that lavished enormous amounts of overwhelmingly positive coverage upon Donald Trump throughout the Republican primaries. But now, just like we've seen at NBC, it's destruction time. The media chose the GOP nominee, then turned on him with a vengeance. As predicted. And so Trump -- losing badly, and toxic to most women, non-whites, and young voters -- is entering a bunker mentality with his inner circle:\n\nINSIDE TRUMP WORLD: Facing a storm, they're digging in.

Ryan has been a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s and this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him, although he stopped short of formally unendorsing him.\n\nTrump\u2019s outburst marked yet another sign of the growing divisions between the candidate and the rest of his party, and the candidate\u2019s willingness to throw political prudence to the wind to attack any dissenter. \u201cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\n\nHis tirade came days after dozens of elected Republicans abandoned Trump in the wake of leaked video where he bragged about groping women. The backlash culminated in a conference call on Monday with House Republicans at which Ryan essentially cut Trump loose and seemed to acknowledge that Hillary Clinton would win the election.\n\nShortly after landing in San Antonio for a closed press fundraiser, Trump extended his attacks, railing against the 2008 GOP nominee, John McCain, for withdrawing his endorsement. \u201cThe very foul mouthed Sen John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!\u201d Trump tweeted. McCain issued a statement that he was unable to even offer his party\u2019s nominee \u201cconditional support\u201d on Saturday in the wake of what the Arizona senator called Trump\u2019s \u201cboasts about sexual assaults\u201d.\n\nTrump had previously mocked McCain, a decorated war hero, for being captured during the Vietnam war after his plane was shot down.\n\n\n\nRubio, who ran against Trump in the presidential primary, said his position had not changed in a statement on Tuesday after facing mounting pressure from his opponent in the Florida Senate race to dump Trump.\n\n\u201cI disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI wish we had better choices for president. But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next president.\n\n\u201cWhile I respect that voters chose him as the GOP nominee, I have never hesitated to oppose his policies I disagree with,\u201d he added of Trump. \u201cAnd I have consistently rejected his offensive rhetoric and behavior.\u201d\n\nRubio did not specifically address in his statement the tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. The senator\u2019s only remark on its content was a tweet late on Friday, in which he said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cvulgar, egregious [and] impossible to justify\u201d.\n\nThe senator was trounced by his former rival by 20 points in the Florida primary, and needs Trump\u2019s base of support to be re-elected in his home state next month.\n\nHis statement came shortly after Ted Cruz, another 2016 contender expected to seek the presidency again, also reaffirmed his support for Trump.\n\n\u201cI am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is an absolute disaster,\u201d Cruz said in an interview with a local Texas station.\n\n\u201cNow my differences with Donald, I have articulated at great length during the campaign,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is an election unlike any other but I\u2019ll tell you, Hillary Clinton, I think, is manifestly unfit to be president.\u201d\n\nTrump attacked Ryan with his first tweet this morning, writing: \u201cDespite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!\u201d and then continuing \u201cour very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty\u201d.\n\nPolls conducted using more rigorous methodology \u2013 rather than the self-selecting online polls Trump has highlighted \u2013 have ruled that Clinton \u201cwon\u201d the second debate on Sunday night.\n\nMatt McDermott (@mattmfm) Politico poll too finds Hillary won the debate.\n\n\n\nPolitico - Clinton 42 / Trump 28\n\nCNN - Clinton 57 / Trump 24\n\nYouGov - Clinton 47 / Trump 42\n\nTrump then boasted that \u201cthe shackles have been taken off me\u201d before attacking fellow Republicans for perceived disloyalty.\n\nDonald J.

Trump supporters rallied outside the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington on Monday in protest against what they saw as the national party\u2019s anti-Trump bias.\n\nThe protest was organized by the Trump campaign\u2019s Virginia state chairman, who was fired for what the deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, called \u201ca stunt in front of the RNC without the knowledge or the approval of the Trump campaign\u201d. Meanwhile Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson bragged on Twitter on Monday about the number of people who were voting for Trump but not voting for Republican candidates for the Senate and the House.\n\nEarlier this year, while the primary process was still taking place, Trump renounced a pledge he had made to support the GOP nominee whoever he or she was because \u201cI have been treated very unfairly\u201d.\n\nBefore his 2016 run for the White House, Trump, who most recently registered as a Republican in April 2012, had donated to a number of Democratic politicians and flirted with a third-party campaign for the presidency in 2000.", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8340c3d5bfd140ecf8651321e95698afa058487b/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=3ab935019f8f8b8117a1e0a1f19c61b8", "title": "Trump rails against 'disloyal' Republicans as support collapses", "summary": "Politico - Clinton 42 / Trump 28CNN - Clinton 57 / Trump 24YouGov - Clinton 47 / Trump 42Trump then boasted that \u201cthe shackles have been taken off me\u201d before attacking fellow Republicans for perceived disloyalty.\nHis tirade came days after dozens of elected Republicans abandoned Trump in the wake of leaked video where he bragged about groping women.\nHis statement came shortly after Ted Cruz, another 2016 contender expected to seek the presidency again, also reaffirmed his support for Trump.\nBut I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next president.\n\u201cI am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is an absolute disaster,\u201d Cruz said in an interview with a local Texas station.", "source": "The Guardian", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Sabrina Siddiqui", "Ben Jacobs"], "keywords": ["disloyal", "clinton", "trump", "nominee", "support", "republicans", "rails", "hillary", "ryan", "statement", "republican", "collapses", "trumps"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-10 11:40:45-04:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-trump-no-unendorse_us_57fba342e4b068ecb5e03cec?section=us_politics", "text": "Discussion was spirited during the call, according to sources, as some pro-Trump members spoke up in support of the nominee.

Here's a closer look at the top fact checks from the town-hall style face-off on Oct. 9 in St. Louis. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the second presidential debate, Donald Trump once again relied on many dubious and false claims that have been repeatedly been debunked. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on occasion made a factual misstep, but it didn\u2019t even compare to Trump\u2019s long list of exaggerations.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of 25 interesting and suspect claims. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.\n\n\u201cOne of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nTrump mixes up a story about a long-ago criminal case. Clinton did not laugh at a rape victim.\n\nIn 1975, Clinton \u2014 then Hillary Rodham \u2014 was a 27-year-old law professor running a legal aid clinic in the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. After a 41-year-old factory worker was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl, he asked the judge to replace his male court-appointed attorney with a female one. The judge went through the list of a half-dozen women practicing law in the county and picked Clinton.\n\nIn her autobiography, \u201cLiving History,\u201d Clinton wrote, \u201cI told [prosecutor] Mahlon [Gibson] I really don\u2019t feel comfortable taking on such a client, but Mahlon gently reminded me that I couldn\u2019t very well refuse the judge\u2019s request.\u201d Gibson has confirmed that account in interviews with Newsday and CNN, saying Clinton told him: \u201cI don\u2019t want to represent this guy. I just can\u2019t stand this. I don\u2019t want to get involved. Can you get me off?\u201d\n\nUltimately, the prosecution\u2019s case fell apart for a number of reasons, including investigators mishandling evidence of bloody underwear, so in a plea agreement the charges were reduced from first-degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14. Not until 2008 did the victim, Kathy Shelton, realize that Clinton had been the lawyer on the other side. She has since attacked Clinton for putting \u201cme through hell,\u201d and she appeared at a news event with Trump before the debate.\n\nThe rape case reemerged when the Washington Free Beacon in 2014 discovered unpublished audio recordings from the mid-1980s of Clinton being interviewed by Arkansas reporter Roy Reed for an article that was never published.\n\nIn the recorded interview, Clinton is heard laughing or giggling four times when discussing the case with unusual candor; the reporter is also heard laughing, and sometimes Clinton is responding to him.\n\nHere are the four instances:\n\n\u201cOf course he [the defendant] claimed he didn\u2019t [rape]. All this stuff. He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\u201d (Both Clinton and the reporter laugh.)\n\n\u201cSo I got an order to see the evidence and the prosecutor didn\u2019t want me to see the evidence. I had to go to Maupin Cummings [the judge] and convince Maupin that yes indeed I had a right to see the evidence before it was presented. (Clinton laughs lightly between \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cbefore.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI handed it [a biography of her expert witness] to Mahlon Gibson, and I said, \u2018Well this guy\u2019s ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d (Clinton laughs, as does the reporter.)\n\n\u201cSo [Judge] Maupin had to, you know, under law he was supposed to determine whether the plea was factually supported. Maupin asked me to leave the room while he examined my client so that he could find out if it was factually supported. I said \u2018Judge I can\u2019t leave the room I\u2019m his lawyer!\u2019 he said \u2018I know but I don\u2019t want to talk about this in front of you.\u2019\u201d (Reporter says, \u201cOh God, really?\u201d And they both laugh.)\n\nBill Clinton \u201chad to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nPaula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, alleged that in 1991 Clinton, while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexual harassment suit. The case was dismissed by a federal judge, who ruled that even if her allegations were true, such \u201cboorish and offensive\u201d behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law. That ruling was under appeal when Clinton in 1998 settled the suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000 was directed to pay legal fees.\n\nYour [Obamacare] health insurance is going up \u2026 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nPremiums are expected to increase overall in 2017, but Trump is cherry-picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace.\n\nState-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s July analysis. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies.\n\nThe vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \u201canecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTo support the debunked notion that Clinton\u2019s campaign originated \u201cbirther\u201d rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign, Trump once again referenced longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal and Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle. But he\u2019s grasping at straws \u2014 and once again refused to apologize for his own role in promoting the birther fable.\n\nJames Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, has said that Blumenthal \u201cstrongly urged\u201d him to \u201cinvestigate the exact place of President Obama\u2019s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.\u201d McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said. (We reached out to Asher several times but did not receive a response.)\n\nBlumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: \u201cThis is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.\u201d\n\nSolis Doyle said in a recent CNN interview that in December 2007, a volunteer coordinator in Iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy. Clinton \u201cmade the decision immediately to let that person go,\u201d Solis Doyle said in the interview.\n\nAs in the instance with the Iowa volunteer coordinator, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clinton\u2019s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim. We found that there\u2019s no evidence that she or her campaign were \u201cpressing it very hard\u201d \u2014 though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against Obama.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton attacked those same women, attacked them viciously.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nTrump has used this line of attack throughout the campaign, sometimes saying Hillary Clinton was an \u201cenabler\u201d of her husband\u2019s affairs, saying she would \u201cgo after these women and destroy their lives.\u201d\n\nOne of the interviews that Clinton\u2019s critics have pointed to is a Jan. 27, 1998, interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show, saying it showed Clinton was discrediting allegations by then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This interview took place a week after her husband was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky, and Clinton blamed Republican foes for making false attacks against her husband.\n\nSpecifically, critics have pointed to this quote by Clinton:\n\n\u201cI mean, look at the very people who are involved in this, they have popped up in other settings,\u201d Clinton told Matt Lauer. \u201cThis is the great story here, for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\u201d\n\nThis interview, by many accounts, was certainly pivotal to saving Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. But by Hillary Clinton\u2019s account at the time, her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. That did not happen until Aug. 15, 1998, according to her memoir.\n\nMoreover, at the time of the interview, Lewinsky also denied there had been a relationship. Her lawyer had submitted an affidavit on Jan. 12 from her saying she \u201cnever had a sexual relationship with the president.\u201d Lewinsky did not begin to testify before the independent prosecutor about the full extent of the relationship until July 27, six months after the \u201cToday\u201d show interview. Lewinsky testified for 15 days, after which the president finally confessed to his wife.\n\nSee our in-depth fact-checks on this here and here.\n\n\u201cBill Clinton was abusive to those women.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nWhile Trump has ramped up the attacks on the Clintons and the sex allegations against Bill Clinton, the record shows that Trump dismissed or minimized these very allegations for many years. Trump dismissed the women involved as losers and not attractive. Trump even suggested that Americans would have been more forgiving if Clinton had slept with more beautiful women.\n\nHere are some examples (see more here):\n\nIn 1998, Trump attacked Paula Jones, who had sued Clinton, alleging sexual harassment: \u201cPaula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, Trump faulted Bill Clinton for the way he handled the Lewinsky scandal, and complained about his choice in women: \u201cHe handled the Monica situation disgracefully. It\u2019s sad because he would go down as a great president if he had not had this scandal. People would have been more forgiving if he\u2019d had an affair with a really beautiful woman of sophistication. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were on a different level. Now Clinton can\u2019t get into golf clubs in Westchester. A former president begging to get in a golf club. It\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d\n\nDuring a 2001 interview, Trump again expressed sympathy for Bill Clinton, arguing that the former president\u2019s biggest mistake was answering questions about his sex life. Trump said he likes Clinton, and finds it all too easy to understand why the then-president found it hard to answer the question: \u201cDid you f\u2014 Monica?\u201d \u201cWhat he should have done is fought for years not to answer it,\u201d Trump said in the interview. \u201cI mean, isn\u2019t it amazing and terrible that a guy \u2014 a president \u2014 is put in that position? He could have gone down as truly great and, instead, you know, he\u2019ll be viewed somewhat differently, which is really a shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money \u2014 and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked.\n\nBut the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.\n\n\u201cIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nThere is no evidence this was the case in the 2015 terrorist attack that killed 14 people. There have been unconfirmed second- or third-hand reports \u2014 a friend of a friend of a neighbor \u2014 that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling. The religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown, but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not Muslim.\n\n\u201cYou [Clinton] get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump is technically correct on the timeline, but Clinton\u2019s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena, according to the FBI\u2019s August 2016 report. Moreover, there\u2019s no evidence Clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena, and FBI director James B. Comey has said his agency\u2019s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were \u201cintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact compiled a helpful timeline of events relating to Clinton\u2019s release of her emails, based on the FBI report. From their timeline:\n\nOn July 23, 2014, the State Department agreed to produce records pertaining to the 2012 attacks in Libya, for the House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s investigation. In December 2014, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills told an employee of the company that managed her server to delete emails on her server unrelated to government work that were older than 60 days.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the Benghazi Committee issued a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over her emails relating to Libya. Three weeks later, between March 25 and March 31, the employee had an \u201coh s\u2014\u201d moment and realized he did not delete the emails that Mills requested in December 2014, he told the FBI. The employee then deleted the emails and used a program called BleachBit to delete the files.\n\n\u201cI was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nThis is just totally false.\n\nWe have found no evidence of his early opposition. Trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on Sept. 11, 2002, and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the August 2004 Esquire cover story titled, \u201cDonald Trump: How I\u2019d Run the Country (Better).\u201d\n\nBut by the middle of 2004, many Americans had turned against the war, making Trump\u2019s position not particularly unique. In light of Trump\u2019s repeated false claim, Esquire has added an editor\u2019s note to its August 2004 story, saying, \u201cThe Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trump\u2019s timeline.\u201d We have awarded this claim Four Pinocchios, compiled a timeline of all of Trump\u2019s comments prior to the invasion in March 2003, and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim.\n\n\u201cOur taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump is simply wrong when he says the United States is the highest-taxed nation in the world.\n\nThe Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for developed countries.\n\nIn 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of the economy \u2014 was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third \u2014 and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent.\n\n\u201c[I] negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.\u201d \u2014 Clinton\n\nClinton overstated the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement, which she helped negotiate as secretary of state.\n\nNew START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons, but Russia was actually already meeting the treaty\u2019s limits, for the most part, when the treaty\u2019s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.\n\nRussia\u2019s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline, from 40,000, since 1986. During Obama\u2019s presidency, Russia\u2019s nuclear warhead total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012.\n\n\u201cAs soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my taxes.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump cites an Internal Revenue Service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns, but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns. Richard Nixon, who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns, did so in the middle of an audit.\n\nMoreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.\n\nPresidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Hillary Clinton has released three decades\u2019 worth of tax returns.\n\n\u201cGaddafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump is simply wrong.\n\nThe toppling of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi \u2014 at the hands of Libyan rebels aided by U.S. and NATO air power \u2014 has led to highly unstable governance as the country\u2019s tribes have vied for influence and power. There are rival governments based in the capital of Tripoli and the eastern city of Tobruk, and neither has fully recognized the \u201cunity\u201d government established by United Nations mediators.\n\nThe National Oil Corporation (NOC) claims to be operating independently without taking orders from either of the country\u2019s rival governments, though a rival NOC appears to have been set up in the east. ISIS has attempted to step into the power vacuum. But not a single expert or news article that we consulted said that ISIS has grabbed a single oil field. Instead, militants appear to be trying to disrupt the flow of oil, mainly by scaring workers away.\n\nClaudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told The Fact Checker it was not true that the Islamic State has control of any Libyan oil.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields,\u201d Gazzini said. \u201cAt the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump made a ludicrous claim that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens made 600 requests for help before he perished in the September 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. This is a misunderstanding of a figure widely used by Republicans on the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but even they never claimed that these came from Stevens.\n\nThe Fact Checker delved deeply into this \u201c600\u201d figure. It is a subjective accounting of \u201crequests and concerns,\u201d not actual requests for help. There is no dispute that security was inadequate in Benghazi and that the State Department failed to respond to all requests for security. But the shorthand description of \u201c600 requests\u201d has left a misleading impression \u2014 so much so that many reporters and lawmakers appear to believe that all of these requests were ignored. At least some of the requests were actually fulfilled \u2014 and the counting of \u201cconcerns\u201d may be subject to dispute.\n\n\u201cWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nHomicides were up 10.8 percent nationwide in 2015, the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971, according to FBI data. But violent crimes overall have been declining for about two decades, and are far below rates seen one or two decades ago.\n\nHomicides have continued to spike in major cities this year, though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Law enforcement officials, including the FBI, have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nCriminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as year over year. An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nTrump takes Clinton\u2019s statement out of context. During a March 2016 town hall, Clinton was asked by a voter: \u201cMake the case to poor whites who live in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, who vote Republican, why they should vote for you based upon economic policies versus voting for a Republican?\u201d\n\nClinton gave a lengthy response, which included the line, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d It was part of her longer answer about how transitioning away from coal-powered plants has already affected mining communities, and her plan to help coal mine workers adjust after losing factory jobs, as explained in her November 2015 policy proposal for revitalizing coal communities.\n\nHere\u2019s her full answer. The portion that Trump cited is in bold.\n\nWell, first of all, I was happy to carry those states you mentioned, and I carried the white vote in those states, too, that voted Democratic now, I don\u2019t want to get carried away here. Look, we have serious economic problems in many parts of our country. And Roland is absolutely right. Instead of dividing people the way Donald Trump does, let\u2019s reunite around policies that will bring jobs and opportunities to all these underserved poor communities. So for example, I\u2019m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because we\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right, Tim? And we\u2019re going to make it clear that we don\u2019t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories.Now we\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don\u2019t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.So whether it\u2019s coal country or Indian country or poor urban areas, there is a lot of poverty in America. We have gone backwards. We were moving in the right direction. In the \u201990s more people were lifted out of poverty than anytime in recent history. Because of the terrible economic policies of the Bush administration, President Obama was left with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and people fell back into poverty because they lost jobs, they lost homes, they lost opportunities, and hope. So I am passionate about this, which is why I have put forward specific plans about how we incentivize more jobs, more investment in poor communities, and put people to work.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t \u2018check out a sex tape.\u2019 It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nThis is easy to disprove. Let\u2019s look at the tweet, sent at 5:30 a.m. regarding former Miss Universe Alicia Machado:\n\nDid Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016\n\nTrump claims that Machado is \u201cno angel.\u201d No sex tape has surfaced since Trump sent out the late-night tweet. But he clearly tweeted that people should \u201ccheck out sex tape.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go into the inner cities and you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African Americans, now, 45 percent [are in] poverty in the inner cities.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump\u2019s source is on this one, and his campaign did not respond to our inquiry. In 2015, 24 percent of black people lived below poverty levels, according to the Census. Black people had the highest rate of poverty among all racial groups (21 percent of Hispanics, 11 percent of Asians and 11.6 percent of whites).\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the majority of black people do not live in the \u201cinner city,\u201d as the NAACP tweeted during the debate.\n\n#Fact: the majority of black people in America don't live in the \"inner city\". \u2014 NAACP (@NAACP) October 10, 2016\n\nResearch shows that as of 2010, the majority of blacks, Asians and Latinos in metropolitan areas lived in the suburbs.\n\n\u201cThere is a thing called clean coal.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nCoal is not clean. When burned in power plants, it emits sulfur dioxides, nitrous oxides and mercury unless coal-fired power plants have scrubbers to remove those from the air, thanks to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency that Trump said was \u201cso restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.\u201d\n\nCoal also emits carbon dioxide, which the Supreme Court in 2007 said was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That carbon dioxide can only be removed from emissions at great cost, and the technique is not currently in use except in areas where it can be used for enhanced oil recovery.\n\nFinally, the act of mining coal is not clean. It either involves open-pit mines or underground mines that often pollute waters. And coal-fired power plants also produce coal ash waste that is often kept in ponds that are prone to leaking.\n\nProbably the major reason for the decline in coal use is the discovery of a way to tap into shale gas, which has brought down the price of natural gas. Many utilities are switching to natural gas.\n\n\u201cYou know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.\u201d \u2014 Clinton\n\nActually, the United States is still a net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products. It imported 5.3 million barrels a day in July, according to the Energy Information Administration. That is, however, down sharply from the 13 million barrels a day of imports reached in 2006.\n\nClinton went onto say, \u201cWe are not dependent upon the Middle East.\u201d That\u2019s correct, but it\u2019s been the case for years. Canada is the biggest source for American oil imports \u2014 more than the entire Persian Gulf combined.\n\n\u201cWith all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nThis is wrong. The Obama administration has admitted 12,500 refugees over the past fiscal year, which slightly exceeded a goal of 10,000. Even so, this is about one-third accepted by Canada, with a much smaller population.\n\nTrump in the past has claimed that Clinton wants to admit 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has supported accepting up to 65,000 refugees from Syria in one year. This is 55,000 more than the Obama administration\u2019s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 620,000 figure that Trump often uses is based in the unverified assumption that Clinton would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration\u2019s proposal for 100,000 total refugees for fiscal year 2017. (Multiply 155,000 four times and you reach 620,000.) After Trump made his comment about \u201chundreds of thousands,\u201d moderator Martha Raddatz deftly noted that Clinton had asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000.\n\n\u201cSince the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.\u201d \u2014 Clinton\n\nClinton\u2019s talking point is out of date. The Census Bureau reported in September that median income was up 5.2 percent from 2014 to 2015, to $56,516. This is the first annual increase in median household income since 2007, the year before the Great Recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLast year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. Other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nThe United States has a trade deficit of about $500 billion in goods and services. Trump appears to be referring the deficit in goods, which was nearly $800 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government \u2014 because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well \u2014 chose me to do the Old Post Office. \u2026 One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.\u201d \u2014 Trump\n\nThis is not the full story. The federal government weighed several factors when considering bids for redevelopment of the Old Post Office building: 50 percent were qualitative (including past performance of the developer, site plan and design concept) and 50 percent were quantitative (developer\u2019s financial capability and capacity and the developer\u2019s financial offer).\n\nTwo factors weighed heavily in Trump\u2019s favor: the financial backing of major real estate investor Colony Capital and the design by prominent architect Arthur Cotton Moore.\n\nTrump had submitted the bid with Colony Capital as the financial backer, and the Trump Organization as the lead developer. The Washington Post\u2019s Jonathan O\u2019Connell wrote: \u201cColony is a major global investor in real estate, which bolstered Trump\u2019s efforts to secure the deal. At the time, Colony had already invested $45 billion in more than 14,000 corporate and real estate assets, ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide.\u201d\n\nBut after the Trump Organization won the bid, Colony Capital backed out of the deal, saying that \u201cthe project\u2019s timeline became too long for the firm.\u201d The Trumps instead contributed $40 million to $42 million in equity and borrowed $170 million from Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe selection of Moore \u201cbolstered the organization\u2019s experience restoring or managing historic buildings in New York,\u201d O\u2019Connell wrote. Moore stepped down from the project less than a year after Trump won the bid. He told the New York Times: \u201cI left because I couldn\u2019t support what they were doing to the building. They were covering up or tearing out everything that was historic.\u201d\n\n1 of 21 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Clinton and Trump face off during second presidential debate in St. Louis View Photos The presidential nominees clashed during a town-hall-style debate at Washington University.

Trump calls Clinton the devil.\n\nIt was the ugliest debate in American history.\n\nFor 90 minutes Sunday night, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton called each other liars, untrustworthy and unfit for office as they sparred not so much about their policy differences as their basic characters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump even threatened to \u201cjail\u201d Clinton if he became president. \u201cBelieve me, she has tremendous hate in her heart,\u201d Trump said. Clinton accused Trump of launching distractions and diversions: \u201cAnything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding.\u201d\n\nIt was nearly nonstop name-calling and nastiness \u2014 they opened by dispensing with the traditional handshake, and an agitated Trump repeatedly encroached on Clinton\u2019s physical space as he paced the debate stage. There were only brief reprieves of policy discussion, which soon devolved back into a contentious affair, even as they had to balance their attacks with flashes of geniality before a town-hall audience of undecided voters.\n\nFrom its earliest moments, the debate was colored by the events of the previous two days, beginning Friday with the appearance of a decade-old tape in which Trump described in graphic and sexually aggressive terms making unwanted advances on women, which he said he was entitled to do because he was a \u201cstar.\u201d Legions of Republicans have abandoned his campaign over the lecherous remarks, which co-moderator Anderson Cooper described to Trump on Sunday night as amounting to \u201csexual assault.\u201d\n\nTrump tried to downplay the tape \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s just words folks, it\u2019s just words\u201d \u2014 as he shifted the topic to former President Bill Clinton, to the Islamic State, to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, to anything else.\n\n\u201cThis was locker room talk,\u201d Trump said over and over.\n\nClinton would not let Trump off the hook. \u201cWhat we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women, and he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is, but I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is,\" she said.\n\nClinton framed this election as different than any other Democrat-vs.-Republican contest.\n\n\u201cI never questioned their fitness to serve,\u201d she said of past GOP nominees. \u201cDonald Trump is different.\u201d\n\nTrump said he wasn\u2019t proud of his comments, but he accused the Democratic nominee's husband, Bill Clinton, of far worse \u201cactions,\u201d pointing to four women whom Trump had invited into the audience with allegations against the Clintons. Trump had held a brief event with those women before the debate.\n\nAsked three times by Cooper whether he had physically accosted women the way he described on the tape, Trump eventually said, \u201cNo I have not,\u201d though some women have publicly accused him of touching them inappropriately.\n\nClinton said Trump owed the American people an apology \u2014 not just for the tape but his past attacks on President Barack Obama over his birthplace, the family of a fallen soldier, and others.\n\n\u201cHe owes the president an apology and our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words,\u201d she said.\n\nThere was no apology. Instead, more attacks, as Trump tried to make the debate about Clinton, hitting her for her private email server and saying that, as president, he would appoint a special prosecutor, and adding that \u201cyou would go to jail.\u201d\n\nTrump cavalierly called Clinton the \u201cdevil,\u201d as Trump questioned how Clinton could effect change after decades in politics, as she questioned his fundamental fitness.\n\n\u201cWith her, it\u2019s all talk and no action,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump arrived in St. Louis a candidate hemorrhaging support, and badly, but he did appear to find his political footing after some early moments speaking about the tape. Still, Trump did so while playing loose with the truth. Trump said again he was opposed to the war in Iraq despite public comments otherwise in 2002.\n\nHe also denied that after the first debate he urged people on Twitter to look up a sex tape of a beauty pageant winner he was sparring with. \u201cIt was not \u2018check out a sex tape,\u2019\u201d Trump said on Sunday. In fact, Trump had tweeted \u201ccheck out sex tape\u201d in a 5 a.m. tweet.\n\nIn one remarkable exchange, co-moderator Martha Raddatz pressed Trump on his Syria policy and whether he agreed with a newly aggressive posture that had been outlined by his running mate, Mike Pence, in the vice presidential debate last week.\n\n\u201cHe and I haven't spoken,\u201d Trump said flatly. \u201cAnd I disagree.\u201d\n\nAs Trump amped up his attacks, Clinton appeared to lose her patience, accusing the billionaire of desperately trying to throw out distractions because his campaign is \u201cexploding.\u201d \u201cI know you are into big diversion, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way Republicans are leaving you,\u201d she shot at Trump.\n\nFormer GOP presidential nominee John McCain led a parade of Republicans who withdrew their endorsements of Trump over the weekend, including governors, congressmen and incumbent senators in nearly every contested race this fall. Even Pence declined to campaign publicly with Trump on Saturday \u2014 an unprecedented rebuke from a running mate.\n\nView 12 most heated moments in an unprecedented debate Here are the most memorable and heated moments of the night from the second presidential debate in St. Louis on Sunday night.\n\nIn the hours ahead of the debate, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski called Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus \u201cweak\u201d and a \u201cfailed leader,\u201d and the debate itself seemed to do little to end the GOP circular firing squad.\n\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC after the debate, \u201cSome are on the list of people who won't support Donald Trump because they ride around on a high horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would talk to some of the members of Congress out there. I remember when I was younger and prettier, them rubbing up against girls sticking their tongues down women's throats. It was true,\u201d Conway told Chris Matthews.\n\nDecorum made a momentary appearance during the debate itself. When it was unclear whose turn it was to answer one question, Trump interjected, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead.\u201d But for most of the night, it was anything but a gentlemanly affair.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got bad judgment, honestly so bad that she should never be president of the United States,\u201d Trump said at one point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality,\u201d Clinton said at another.\n\nClinton went on the attack over Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, and the alleged hacking of the Democratic Party this year. \u201cMaybe because he wants to do business in Moscow,\u201d she said.\n\nLater, as Clinton tried to defend whether her recently hacked and released speeches to Wall Street showed her to be \u201ctwo-faced,\u201d she invoked seeing a film on Abraham Lincoln. Trump seized upon the remark.\n\n\u201cShe lied. Now she is blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln,\u201d Trump said to laughter from the audience. \u201cHonest Abe never lied. That's the difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That's a big difference.\u201d\n\nIn one of his shakiest moments, Trump demonstrated his inability to answer specific questions on foreign policy, as Raddatz repeatedly pressed him on Syria.\n\nWhen asked what would happen if war-torn Aleppo falls, Trump stumbled for an answer. \u201cIt has fallen. It basically has fallen,\u201d before talking instead about Mosul, which is in Iraq.\n\nIn the final half-hour, a frustrated Trump started the blame game, claiming the moderators were unfairly allowing Clinton\u2019s answers to run long while he was being repeatedly cut off. \u201cIt\u2019s really very interesting,\u201d Trump huffed.\n\nThe media gamesmanship began before the two candidates took the stage, as Trump sprung a surprise stunt that hinted at the nasty debate to follow: holding a photo-op with four women who have alleged they were victimized by the Clintons to various degrees, including Juanita Broaddrick, who declared, \u201cMr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me, and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don\u2019t think there is any comparison.\u201d\n\nTrump tried to echo some of those accusations early in the debate, but Clinton pivoted away.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all, \u2018When they go low, you go high,\u2019\u201d Clinton said to applause from the crowd.\n\nBut most of the campaign was spent deep in the gutter. A brief, bright moment came in the end, when both candidates were asked by a voter what they respected about each other.\n\nClinton said Trump\u2019s children. He said he admired her \u201cfight.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t quit,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWith that, they ended with the handshake that they had skipped at the opening, and their teams headed off to the spin room to bludgeon one another anew.\n\n", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201610/1239/1155968404_5163460296001_5163433769001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "title": "UGLIEST DEBATE EVER", "summary": "2016 UGLIEST DEBATE EVER Clinton says Trump's campaign is exploding.\nIn the hours ahead of the debate, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski called Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus \u201cweak\u201d and a \u201cfailed leader,\u201d and the debate itself seemed to do little to end the GOP circular firing squad.\nView 12 most heated moments in an unprecedented debate Here are the most memorable and heated moments of the night from the second presidential debate in St. Louis on Sunday night.\nIt was the ugliest debate in American history.\nI don\u2019t think there is any comparison.\u201dTrump tried to echo some of those accusations early in the debate, but Clinton pivoted away.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Ben Schreckinger", "Hadas Gold", "Matthew Nussbaum", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": ["clinton", "trump", "campaign", "moments", "clintons", "ugliest", "words", "president", "tape", "debate", "women"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-08 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/8/trump-remarks-condemned-every-female-republican-se/", "text": "Every female Republican in the U.S. Senate has either condemned Donald Trump or renounced their support for his presidential campaign within 24 hours of his White House bid being called into question upon the release of a 2005 recording where he\u2019s heard making vulgar comments about women.\n\nThe remarks were first reported Friday afternoon by the Washington Post, and all six female Republicans in the Senate had weighed in by the same time Saturday.\n\nSusan Collins of Maine told the Portland Press Herald she believes the comments demonstrate why the Republican Party\u2019s candidate is \u201cunsuitable for the presidency,\u201d while Lisa Murkowski of Alaska tweeted that Mr. Trump has \u201cforfeited his right\u201d to the nomination.\n\nTwo others \u2014 Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Deb Fischer of Nebraska \u2014each signaled support for Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov.

Trump is heard in a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush, the Access Hollywood host; they went with \u201cextremely lewd\u201d in their headline.\n\nBut \u201clewd,\u201d extremely or not, fails to capture the full essence of that recording. Lewd can be funny. Lewd can even be sexy, in a sleazy, slumming-it kind of way. Lewd can be fine, if whatever it is describing is consensual and no minors are involved. The staff members of New York magazine got a lot closer with a tweet containing a link to the tape: \u201cExtremely disturbing,\u201d they called it.\n\nYou might say the recording crosses the line from \u201cextremely lewd\u201d to \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d about a minute in, when Trump starts boasting that when he\u2019s attracted to women, he just starts kissing them. \u201cI don\u2019t even wait,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d he says, including, apparently, grabbing the most private part of a woman\u2019s anatomy.\n\nHis thinking is ingenious in how hard it works to justify itself, how it flatters Trump: Take first, then claim they let you; explain it all with an inflated notion of your desirability and celebrity. Hovering underneath all that supposed desire is contempt: These women are so stupid, they\u2019ll let me do anything. If there were any doubt that Trump is objectifying a young soap opera star he is about to meet, Trump\u2019s pronoun choice, to Bush, as he sees and describes her, says it all: \u201cIt looks good.\u201d It. Not she. It.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in some ways, the most disturbing moment of the recording transpires when Bush and Trump descend from the bus. Waiting for them is the actress Arianne Zucker of \u201cDays of Our Lives.\u201d On the bus, her hotness has inspired cackles, what sound like high-fives, expletives. Both men have talked about her legs. Trump has already thrown back some Tic Tacs, in case he decides to lunge for a kiss. But when he steps off the bus, Trump greets her with the courtesy of a Boy Scout: \u201cHello, how are you, hi!\u201d\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

An error has occurred. Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cHi, Mr. Trump, how are you?\u201d Zucker says. She is polite; she is professional.\n\nIt is a moment of deeply uncomfortable dramatic irony: We, the audience, know something she does not, which is that only moments earlier, Trump was coldly appraising her body parts. Bush, acting as a two-bit pimp, asks Zucker to hug Trump, and then asks for a hug himself. Her small laugh is as fake as Trump\u2019s politeness; it is all excruciating to watch. Then the three of them, now performing, waltz off together. Zucker is game to play along when Bush presses her to answer which of the two men she would pick. \u201cBoth!\u201d she finally says.\n\nMaybe Zucker thinks that she is in on the joke. But really, we know, the power is all theirs. It is not just that the two men have erased her as a person, during their conversation on the bus; it is that they share the knowledge that they have done so, silently, collectively, which amplifies their power over her. It is all unspoken, a clubby secret, a male form of control based on exclusion.\n\nBush and Trump on that bus are, in so many ways, the apotheosis of what so many of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters are ready to overturn: the musty sleaziness that went out of style in the 1970s; the old bosses who want their secretaries pretty; the cigar-chomping power brokers who think sexual harassment is the woman\u2019s problem; the drooling dimwits who have gotten further than they should have on connections and male privilege.

Instead of mauling through Florida as expected, the hurricane mostly stayed over warm waters.\n\nBut after gaining fuel from the warm winds off the coast, Florida's fortune could mean devastation for the surrounding region. President Barack Obama is warning that Matthew is \"still a really dangerous hurricane.\"\n\n\n\nMeeting in the Oval Office on Friday with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, Obama said he was concerned about storm surge and that as the hurricane moves north, areas such as Jacksonville, Florida, and Georgia might be less prepared.\n\nSome 500,000 people were told to evacuate the Jacksonville area, while thousands more were told to completely clear out of Georgia.

Trump is also going to rehearse for his second showdown with Hillary Clinton, after appearing unprepared in his first matchup, with a town hall Thursday night in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump does very well in town halls. That\u2019s because he connects with real people. That\u2019s because he\u2019s not a politician,\u201d Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s communications director, said after Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate.\n\nThe largely well-received performance by running mate Mike Pence in his matchup with Tim Kaine adds pressure to the man on the top of the ticket. The Indiana governor excelled on the debate stage in areas Trump did not -- namely, refusing his opponent\u2019s bait and deflecting criticisms. Pence sat in stark contrast to Trump in terms of his ability to stay steady and stridently on message, and some conservatives delighted in his articulation of conservative principles and topics that have been generally ignored by the GOP nominee.\n\nIn many ways, Pence provided a map for Trump, and shifted the discussion, if even for a moment, away from the worst several days of the candidate\u2019s campaign. The vice presidential candidate\u2019s showing lays the groundwork for Trump, who has little room for error on delivering.\n\nBut the campaign has also been careful to draw a distinction between the two men on the GOP ticket. Asked whether Pence would be helping Trump with debate preparation or giving advice, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told RealClearPolitics there were no plans to get the governor involved because they are different candidates with different styles and personalities. During interviews, Conway dismissed the notion of Pence upstaging the top of the ticket and argued that the governor\u2019s performance displayed Trump\u2019s good character judgment.\n\nIndeed, Trump took credit for the debate. \u201cMike Pence did an incredible job, and I'm getting a lot of credit,\u201d Trump said during a campaign rally in Nevada on Wednesday, noting the governor was his \u201cfirst hire\u201d after clinching the GOP nomination. \u201cHe was cool, he was smart ... Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of presidential debates.\u201d\n\nPence played the good soldier afterward. \u201cFrom where I sat, Donald Trump won the debate,\u201d he said Wednesday, kicking off a bus tour in Virginia before routing through Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nPence displayed his loyalty to his ticket while also buying some protection for his own future in politics, defending his running mate through deflection. He denied controversial statements made by Trump regarding women, Mexicans, nuclear weapons, and Russian aggression, among other issues. He went so far as to dismiss his own past praise of Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership in Russia, a statement that is easily accessible online. At the same time, he showed daylight between himself and Trump at points, calling Putin \u201csmall and bullying,\u201d for example. But the dismissals and denials were often overshadowed by his ability to quickly turn back to prosecuting Clinton.\n\nIf Pence offered lessons in debating and preparation, it\u2019s not clear whether and how Trump will take them. He figures to give some indication Thursday night, through an invitation-only, town hall-style forum in New Hampshire, a state he won in the primary and where he visited just last week.\n\nWhile Trump gains energy from crowds at large rallies, he is less practiced at some of the more intimate town hall events. During the general election, he has participated in televised formats with Fox News host Sean Hannity, but those contained more favorable crowds and questions.\n\n\u201cThe town hall format ideally helps showcase a candidate's relatability,\u201d says GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who was a top adviser for the Mitt Romney campaign. \u201c[Trump is] very good when it comes to connecting with large crowds and feeding off of their energy. The town hall format is more sedate. It also requires a lot of prep, and Trump has shown an aversion towards prep.\u201d\n\nThe Trump team, though, isn\u2019t using the candidate\u2019s inexperience with the format to set low expectations, as campaigns typically do. Conway said on Fox News Wednesday morning that Trump will deliver a \u201cpowerful performance\u201d on Sunday night in St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s a much better format for him than Hillary Clinton. He\u2019s more practiced dealing with people one on one. He\u2019s going to take the case right to her.\u201d\n\nThe more intimate and personality-revealing format could pose challenges for Trump, who has talked about raising the specter of former President Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities. He will have to answer questions from voters who may not agree with him or support him. The setting also places an emphasis on body language and movement around the stage.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, seeing an uptick in polling after the first debate, is helping to set the higher expectations for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting him to be better prepared for the next debate,\u201d campaign manager Robby Mook said Tuesday night. \u201cWe know that there is a calm, cool, and collected Donald Trump that can show up, and we expect that that\u2019s what will happen. He has stated that he will make all sorts of \u2026 attacks. We actually don\u2019t expect that. We think that he understands that that is not the right strategy.\u201d\n\nEmily Goodin contributed to this report.", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/382662_5_.jpg", "title": "Pence's Debate Performance Puts Pressure on Trump", "summary": "The Donald Trump campaign is setting a high bar for the Republican nominee\u2019s next debate performance.\n\u201cWe are expecting him to be better prepared for the next debate,\u201d campaign manager Robby Mook said Tuesday night.\nThe town hall format is more sedate.\nWhile Trump gains energy from crowds at large rallies, he is less practiced at some of the more intimate town hall events.\nThe Indiana governor excelled on the debate stage in areas Trump did not -- namely, refusing his opponent\u2019s bait and deflecting criticisms.", "source": "Real Clear Politics", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": [], "keywords": ["town", "campaign", "trump", "puts", "format", "pences", "hall", "pence", "pressure", "candidates", "night", "performance", "ticket", "debate"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/06/hurricane-matthew-intensifies-as-florida-governor-orders-1-5-million-to-evacuate/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage/story&utm_term=.0e8758dc124d", "text": "Social video shows Hurricane Matthew barreling down on Florida. The hurricane weakened to a Category 2 storm storm late Friday afternoon. (Victoria Walker,Lee Powell/The Washington Post)\n\nORMOND BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Hurricane Matthew churned along Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast on Friday, its center remaining just offshore as the storm battered the state with punishing rain, beach-swallowing sea surges and destructive wind gusts topping 100 mph.\n\nBy late Friday afternoon, the strongest hurricane to menace the United States in a decade had weakened to a Category 2 storm, and it was clear that Florida had dodged some of the worst-case scenarios laid out by forecasters and public officials. Yet the danger wasn\u2019t past: South Carolina was bracing for the storm\u2019s potential landfall there Saturday, and even residents in North Carolina faced a considerable threat.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Friday that the storm\u2019s center had been \u201chugging the coast\u201d in Florida as it continued toward Georgia and South Carolina and warned of a surge of up to nine feet that could cause dangerous flooding.\n\nLate Friday night, the hurricane center said \u201cstrong winds and storm surge\u201d were also spreading north along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina and warned of \u201crising water levels\u201d expected in both states into early Saturday morning.\n\n[Hurricane Matthew remains a dangerous and destructive Category 3 storm]\n\nWhile Matthew is expected to continue weakening over the coming days, forecasters expect it to remain a hurricane until it pivots away from the East Coast on Sunday. On Friday afternoon, as it lashed northeast Florida, hurricane-force winds extended 60 miles from the storm\u2019s center and tropical-storm-force winds reached as far as 185 miles.\n\nAt least four deaths in the state were linked to the storm Friday, officials said. Two were medical emergencies that ambulances couldn\u2019t reach and two were women killed by falling trees. One of these women was trying to \u201cride out the storm\u201d in a camper trailer about halfway between Jacksonville and Orlando when a tree was knocked onto the camper, the Putnam County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\n\nMore than 1.1 million people in Florida lacked power by Friday night, according to the office of Gov. Rick Scott.\n\n[100 years of hurricanes hitting and missing Florida, visualized]\n\nOfficials there were very concerned about storm surge, which had been projected for as high as 11 feet. Scott said he was particularly worried about Jacksonville, home to more residents than any other city in the South.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, video footage on social media showed water breaking through barriers surrounding Jacksonville, which is right along the coast in the northeastern corner of Florida. A cascade of water flooded along palm trees swaying in the wind and rushed toward houses not far from the water.

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than 2.5 million people were told to evacuate in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, where schools and government offices alike were shuttered this week. Florida said airports in Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Melbourne were closed, while airlines canceled nearly 1,500 flights through the state. Disney World closed down Friday, and college football games from Gainesville, Fla., to Columbia, S.C., were called off or rescheduled.\n\nFlood warnings were issued through late Friday night for northern Nassau County, in Florida not far from the Georgia line, as well as Camden and Glynn counties in southeastern Georgia, the National Weather Service said. A flash flood warning was announced for Savannah, Ga., through 5:45 a.m. Saturday.\n\nOfficials in Georgia and South Carolina announced curfews in some places intended to keep people off the roads at night. One in Charleston was to take effect at midnight and last until 6 a.m., the Charleston police said Friday night.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not underestimate how dangerous this hurricane can be,\u201d Gov.

With 69 shelters open statewide, Gov. Nikki Haley (R) again urged people to evacuate in advance of the storm\u2019s arrival. \u201cThere is nothing safe about what is getting ready to happen,\u201d she said.\n\n[Live updates on Hurricane Matthew]\n\nThere was even extreme caution from the Waffle House, the southern institution that has famously become a yardstick for emergency responders looking to gauge the impact disasters have on communities because of how quickly it reopens restaurants.\n\nWaffle House said Friday that it has closed more than two dozen locations from Florida to South Carolina.\n\n1 of 83 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hurricane Matthew pummels the Southeast coast View Photos The strongest hurricane to menace the United States in a decade is continuing its trek north as it rumbles near the coastline.

By the afternoon, gusts of around 80 mph were registered in Flagler Beach and St. Augustine.\n\nFlash flood warnings in the Jacksonville area were announced through Friday evening, and flood warnings were also issued in parts of Volusia, Brevard and Seminole counties.\n\nIn Volusia County, officials said there were initial reports of major damage that included a destroyed iconic fishing pier in Daytona Beach; structural damage to business and homes; fallen trees, flooding and widespread power outages. But the storm\u2019s shift to the east eased some of the risks that had been feared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think 30 miles has ever meant so much to a community, said Volusia County Manager Jim Dinneen. \u201cWe are very fortunate the eye of the storm stayed 30 miles from the coast.

(Storyful)\n\nAs the storm moved toward Daytona Beach on Friday morning, trees were whipped around and downed branches and power lines dotted the roads. Only police cars could be seen driving around. Just to the south in Ormond Beach, a neighbor\u2019s tree landed on the roof of Lynn Kearns\u2019s home, but she still had no plans to leave.\n\n\u201cOur street doesn\u2019t usually flood,\u201d said Kearns, who has lived in this part of Florida for nearly 30 years. The pine tree dangled off the roof as Kearns spoke.\n\nHer windows were boarded up and she was watching the wind whip trees along the street, part of which was already flooded. But she said leaving would be too difficult for her mother and two dogs.\n\nAt a Hampton Inn in Ormond Beach, guests ate breakfast Friday by flashlight and LED candlelight after the electricity went out earlier that morning.\n\n[What we can and can\u2019t say about the hurricane and climate change]\n\nAfter a night of howling winds and whistling gusts, the power went out at 7:30 a.m., and through the morning large raindrops popped against windows as sheets of rain swept in all directions.\n\nCochise Israel lives a half-block from the beach and would ordinarily have stayed there. He said he prefers to be in the home when the roof tears off so he can move furniture into dry areas, adding that he favors \u201cfighting it off as opposed to going back to complete destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always rode them out,\u201d said Israel, 38. \u201cIf anyone is in trouble, I have chainsaws and help them get out. I\u2019ve always been the hero.\u201d\n\nHe spent much of the week helping board up homes and fill sandbags for his older neighbors who opted to ride out the storm. But he said he had little choice but to leave this time, because he had to take care of his 97-year-old great aunt, Dorothy Butler, who suffers from dementia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to be so far away,\u201d Israel said.\n\nAs guests gathered around the hotel doors to watch the squalls, the temperature in the rooms continued to rise.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Gov. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) made during their first and only debate on Oct. 4. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, and the Republican nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, debated Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Here is a roundup of 25 suspicious or interesting claims that were made. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.\n\n\u201cShe worked a deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tim Kaine\n\nKaine surely meant to say nuclear weapons but it came out as chemical weapons. (Later in the debate, he said \u201c[Clinton] went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia\u2019s nuclear stockpile.\u201d)\n\nEven so, Kaine overstates the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreement, which Clinton helped negotiate as secretary of state.\n\nNew START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons but Russia was actually already meeting the treaty\u2019s limits, for the most part, when the treaty\u2019s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.\n\nRussia\u2019s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline from 40,000 since 1986. The total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012, during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cShe worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nKaine leans way over on his skis here. The Iranian nuclear agreement was actually negotiated by Clinton\u2019s successor, John Kerry, though Clinton helped tee up the negotiations by increasing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The deal, which has been sharply criticized by Republicans, did increase the amount of time that Iran would need to build a nuclear weapon by reducing its centrifuges for uranium enrichment and its stockpile of enriched uranium; international monitoring of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities was also implemented. But key elements of the deal expire in 15 years (some go longer) and Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure remains in place.\n\nWhile Iran has insisted it has no interest in building nuclear weapons, the deal does not eliminate the risk that it will obtain nuclear bombs. The agreement limits Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear program and it is also contains an indefinite prohibition on activities related to a weapons program, defined in Annex 1, Section T. Whether those elements eliminates the nuclear weapons program is a matter of opinion.\n\nClinton and Kaine are \u201cactually advocating $1 trillion in tax increases.\u201d \u2014 Mike Pence\n\nIndeed, Clinton\u2019s economic plan would raise an estimated $1.46 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade, according to an analysis by economist Mark Zandi. But the tax hike \u201cfalls almost exclusively on the most highly paid,\u201d the analysis says.\n\nThis figure does not take into account the impact of her other proposals on the economy. For example, his report also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would add an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs. But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress, resulting in far fewer job gains.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He\u2019s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don\u2019t like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn\u2019t a hero because he\u2019d been captured. He said African Americans are living in hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. \u2026 And we don\u2019t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kaine\n\nTrump has, indeed, said all of those things.\n\nDuring his campaign announcement, Trump said: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201c We awarded Trump\u2019s claim connecting illegal immigrants from Mexico and crime Four Pinocchios.\n\n(During the debate, Pence asserted that that Kaine was leaving out a part where Trump said: \u201cMany of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote.\u201d What Trump said, actually, was: \u201cAnd some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Updated thanks to the reader who pointed out Pence\u2019s substitution of \u201cmany\u201d for \u201csome.\u201d)\n\nIn 2007, Trump called Rosie O\u2019Donnell \u201ca slob,\u201d \u201ca pig\u201d and a \u201cdegenerate\u201d in a single speech. He has called Arianna Huffington \u201ca dog\u201d and said New York Times columnist Gail Collins had \u201cthe face of a dog.\u201d\n\nTrump did say that the Indiana-born U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an \u201cinherent conflict of interest\u201d because of his Mexican heritage and Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has said McCain was \u201cnot a war hero,\u201d and that McCain is \u201ca war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Trump has, indeed, said: \u201cWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell, because it\u2019s so dangerous.\u201d And Trump was one of the most high-profile \u201cbirthers\u201d who questioned whether Obama was a U.S. citizen.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Trump said women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to \u201csome sort of punishment.\u201d But he reversed that statement several hours later, after widespread criticism from those on both sides of the abortion rights issue. He amended his statement to say that the doctors, not women, should be punished.\n\n\u201cRichard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nThis is correct. A key difference here is that Nixon did not release his taxes while he was a presidential candidate; he did so in 1973, a year after he was reelected.\n\nPresidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit, even though the first president to release his taxes, Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.\n\n\u201cThe state of Indiana has a balanced budget.\u2026 We\u2019ve made record investments in education and infrastructure.\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nPence is correct on raw numbers regarding education spending, but is incorrect when the figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, state spending on higher education and K-12 education is the largest in Indiana\u2019s history. But adjusted for inflation, the 2017 appropriations are not quite as high as they were in 2010 and 2011, said Lawrence DeBoer, Purdue University economist and an expert on Indiana\u2019s state budget. By 2017, Indiana state spending on education will be almost back to 2011 levels, DeBoer said.\n\nOn infrastructure, Pence began improving the state\u2019s roads only after an emergency repair of the Interstate 65 bridge led to a month-long traffic problem and caused a political liability, the Associated Press reported. Political ads attacked Pence for saving money in the state\u2019s reserves at the expense of underfunding the state\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nPence then proposed a plan to improve roads \u201cthat relied on borrowing, drawing down state reserves and accounting gimmicks to reach an advertised $1 billion sticker price,\u201d the AP reported. \u201cIn the end, he got just a fraction of that after Indiana\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature balked. And much of the money set aside for local governments came from local taxes held in state reserves that were already supposed to be returned.\u201d\n\nClinton and Kaine \u201chave a plan for open borders.\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nPence exaggerates Clinton\u2019s stance on border security and immigration enforcement.\n\nClinton has said she would expand Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration and has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship. But she also has supported enhanced border security. And her immigration proposal includes \u201chumane, targeted and effective\u201d enforcement and focusing immigration resources on detaining and deporting those \u201cwho pose a threat to public safety.\u201d\n\n[Update: Hacked emails released on Oct. 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closed-door speech to a Brazilian bank: \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,\u201d through green energy.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails, but campaign manager Robby Mook said in an Oct. 9 CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview that Clinton was \u201ctalking about integrating green energy between North and South America. \u2026 If the question is, \u2018Does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders?\u2019 Absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this country.\u201d]\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 550 percent.\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nThis is correct. Clinton has said she supports President Obama\u2019s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 \u2014 and that she would support an increase up to 65,000. That is a 550 percent increase from 10,000. But Clinton has not yet disclosed her plan for the new fiscal year or beyond.\n\nThis map below shows where Syrian refugees have ended up in the United States.\n\n\n\nKaine: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be tough on Russia. Let\u2019s start by not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he\u2019s a great leader.\u201d\n\nPence: \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t.\u201d Kaine: \u201cGovernor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.\u201d\n\nPence: \u201cThat is absolutely inaccurate\u2026. He [Trump] said he\u2019s been stronger on the world stage.\u201d\n\nMaybe the GOP ticket did not precisely use the word \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cbetter,\u201d but Kaine pretty much hits the target here.\n\nPence told CNN just a few weeks ago: \u201cI think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been.\u201d Pence made these remarks just after Trump asserted that Putin has \u201cbeen a leader far more than our president has been a leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second component of the [Trump] plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kaine\n\nKaine repeats a line that recently earned Hillary Clinton Three Pinocchios. But no credible analyst would cite the Bush tax cuts as playing a key role in spurring the economic crash.\n\nKaine puts it even more starkly than Clinton. The Clinton campaign tried to suggest income inequality, exacerbated by tax cuts, led to the stagnation of the middle class and spurred excess borrowing and leverage \u2014 key components of the crash along with lax regulation. But that\u2019s a real stretch, given that a housing bubble was the key trigger. The causes of the Great Recession are complex and debatable, but there\u2019s no debate that it is wrong to put the Bush tax cuts at the top of the list.\n\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and said \u2026 quote, \u2018They will all be gone. They will all be gone.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kaine\n\nThis isn\u2019t a direct quote about deporting all undocumented immigrants, but Trump did say that all \u201ccriminal illegal immigrants\u201d (likely referring to undocumented immigrants convicted of a crime) \u201care going to be gone. It will be over.\u201d\n\nAmong other claims Trump made at the Aug. 31 Phoenix rally about removing those here illegally:\n\n\u201cAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.\u201d \u201cUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also laid out his deportation priorities during the speech. Among them: Targeting at least 5 million and as many as 6.5 million undocumented immigrants who would be subject to swift removal. That is about half of the 11 million undocumented people estimated to be living in the United States.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the private meetings when she [Clinton] was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.\u201d \u2014Pence\n\nPence misconstrued an Associated Press report here, similar to the way Donald Trump did earlier in the campaign.\n\nThe AP analyzed State Department records and looked specifically at Clinton\u2019s meetings on the phone or in person with 154 people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives. This narrowed down the denominator to a small subcategory of people Clinton met with as secretary of state, since the majority of her diplomatic work would involve representatives of foreign governments. In addition, the AP report is based on partial records released by the State Department so far and does not reflect the full scope of people with whom Clinton met as secretary of state.\n\nThe AP found that 85 of those 154 people, or \u201cmore than half,\u201d had donated to the Clinton Foundation or \u201cpledged commitments to its international programs.\u201d The 85 donors collectively contributed as much as $156 million, the AP reported. There were representatives from at least 16 foreign governments, who donated as much as $170 million to the charity, but those representatives were not included in the 154 number, the AP reported.\n\n\u201c15 million new jobs? 15 million new jobs?\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nThis is wrong. Counting from January 2009, nearly 11 million private-sector jobs have been created in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you count all jobs, including government jobs, the figure is 10.5 million.\n\nSo how does Kaine come up with 15 million? He\u2019s counting from the low point for jobs in Obama\u2019s presidency, February 2010. When you start the clock from then, the tally is 15 million private-sector jobs and 14.8 million overall jobs.\n\nThe last time we checked, February 2010 was 6 1/2 years ago. So with this claim, Kaine is trying to wipe off a year of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nMoreover, as a general matter, regular readers know that we tend to discount job-creation records by a president, as so much of the record is due to economic forces beyond a president\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cIndependent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nMark Zandi, a respected economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, did issue a report saying that if Trump\u2019s economic plans were fully implemented, 3.5 million jobs would disappear, incomes would stagnate, debt would explode, and stock prices would plummet. (This compares to an anticipated increase of 6 million jobs under current Obama administration policies.) In another report, Zandi also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would create an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs.\n\nBut both reports were highly skeptical that either candidate would be able to get their plans through Congress \u2014 even a Republican-controlled one during a Trump presidency \u2014 because so many of Trump\u2019s positions are such a departure from GOP principles. Even so, the report said the U.S. economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidency. (The report was issued in June, and Moody\u2019s has not issued an updated report that would reflect additional policies announced by Trump, including a revised tax plan. But the report said Trump\u2019s trade policies would be especially damaging.)\n\n\u201cA reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nPence makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money \u2014 and he uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory, those funds would be unlocked.\n\nBut the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he wants to \u2014 that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nTrump has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete, but he has not said he wants to get rid of it. Asked specifically by The Washington Post in March if he wanted to pull out of NATO, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country anymore. \u2026 I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved.\u201d Trump has argued that \u201cdistribution of costs\u201d has to be changed but, as we have noted, Trump frequently overstates the burden on the United States.\n\n\u201cWe will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kaine\n\nKaine is referring to Trump\u2019s 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d where he made such a comparison about Social Security and said he wanted to privatize the program: \u201cThe workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme. The pyramids are made of paper-mache.\u201d\n\nTrump added in the book: \u201cPrivatization would be good for all of us. As it stands today, 13.6 percent of women on Social Security live in poverty.\u201d\n\nBut that book was published 16 years ago. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he wants to \u201ckeep Social Security intact.\u2026 I\u2019m not going to cut it.\u201d His specific plans for the program, however, are vague. His campaign has said \u201cthe key to preserving Social Security and other programs that benefit AARP members is to have an economy that is robust and growing.\u201d\n\nFor more on Social Security and allegations it is a Ponzi scheme, see The Fact Checker\u2019s guide to critical questions about the program.\n\n\u201cWe have the smallest Navy since 1916\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nThis is a zombie claim that just won\u2019t go away. We have awarded it Three Pinocchios, and fact checkers repeatedly debunked this during the 2012 presidential election.\n\nIndeed, the number of ships (272) as of Oct. 4 is the lowest count since 1916 (245 ships). But a lot has changed in 100 years, including the need and capacity of ships. After all, it\u2019s now a matter of modern nuclear-powered fleet carriers versus the gunboats and small warships of 100 years ago. The push for ships under the Reagan era (to build the Navy up to 600-ship levels) no longer exists, and ships from that era are now retiring.\n\nThis talking point is a poor way to depict the country\u2019s naval fleet needs. Gunboats of 1915 and aircraft carriers of 2015 are not the same. And military budgets, fleet needs and historical circumstances are much different in 2015 than they were in 1916.\n\n\u201cWe ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nPence reprises a GOP talking point from the 2012 campaign, but it\u2019s not correct. Obama substituted a different system, but it was on the recommendation of then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican. Gates, in fact, had recommended the original plan to President George W. Bush and then decided the new system implemented by Obama was more effective, less costly and timelier than the Bush plan.\n\nGates, in his 2013 memoir, noted that while the Obama administration had stumbled in failing to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the shift, looking \u201clike a bunch of bumbling fools,\u201d the Bush plan was already running into trouble in both Prague and Warsaw and likely would have been rejected by parliaments in both countries. \u201cThe Polish and Czech governments were relieved,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI sincerely believed the new program was better \u2014 more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat,\u201d Gates added. \u201cWhile there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian \u2018reset,\u2019 we in Defense did not. Making the Russians happy wasn\u2019t exactly on my to-do list.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Gates says, the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective, as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missiles.\n\n\u201cHow ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians,\u201d Gates added sardonically. \u201cIt would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington \u2014 just once in my career \u2014 say, Well I got that wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nTrump has walked back the particular claim that Kaine cites, that \u201cwages are too high.\u201d Of course, Trump has flip-flopped on the minimum wage at least five times since August 2015 and has consistently contradicted his own statements, making it hard to track exactly where he stands on the issue at a given time. Trump\u2019s stance on this matter, as of August 2016, was that he supports \u201craising it to $10 at the federal level, but believes states should set the minimum wage as appropriate for their state.\u201d\n\nDuring a November 2015 Republican primary debate, Trump was asked whether he was \u201csympathetic to the protesters\u2019 cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year.\u201d His full answer, with the part Kaine is quoting in bold:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be, Neil. And the reason I can\u2019t be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I\u2019ve come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It\u2019s going to be a tremendous plan. I think it\u2019ll make our country and our economy very dynamic. But, taxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nDays later, Trump clarified he was referring to whether he would increase the minimum wage. He would not raise it, because then it would be \u201ctoo high,\u201d he said.\n\nKaine correctly notes that Pence, as a congressman, voted in 2007 against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.\n\n\u201cMore and more young people today are embracing life.\u201d \u2014 Pence\n\nPence made this claim in the context of abortion and choosing whether to be for or against abortion rights. But polling does not support this. In fact, it shows young adults\u2019 views on abortion rights are about the same as their elders \u2014 unlike issues like marijuana and gay marriage, where young people are more liberal.\n\nAmong adults aged 18 to 29, 58 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 39 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll. That was similar to those aged 30 to 49 (59 percent supported abortion, 38 percent opposed) and those aged 50 to 64 (56 percent supported, 37 percent opposed).\n\nMike Pence and Tim Kaine sparred over the issue of abortion during the vice-presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., Oct. 4. (The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cBut what I can\u2019t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pence\n\n\u201cPartial-birth abortion\u201d is usually used to refer to later-term abortions using a specific fetus-extraction method.\n\nClinton has said she supports a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, as long as the health and the life of the mother are protected. As senator, Clinton opposed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, which did not include a health exception.\n\nEarlier this year, Clinton again said she is \u201con record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.\u201d\n\nKaine: \u201cMore nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that.\u201d\n\nPence: \u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator.\u201d\n\nKaine: \u201cHe absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.\u201d\n\nTrump has, indeed, said that countries such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons because nuclear proliferation is inevitable. Trump has said that countries like Japan and South Korea would be \u201cbetter off\u201d if they were armed with nuclear weapons, in order to defend themselves from North Korea. And Trumps said he considers nuclear weapons a last resort, though he would not \u201crule anything out\u201d regarding their use.\n\nFor example, during a CNN town hall in March, Trump was asked: \u201cSo if you said, Japan, yes, it\u2019s fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?\u201d\n\nTrump answered: \u201cCan I be honest with you? It\u2019s going to happen, anyway. It\u2019s going to happen anyway. It\u2019s only a question of time. They\u2019re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely. But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe [Clinton] went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.\u201d \u2014 Kaine\n\nThis is an odd, inaccurate comment. The Russia-Georgia war took place in 2008, when Clinton was still a U.S. senator. Bush\u2019s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, lodged the protests. Whatever diplomatic pressure the Bush team had put on Russia over Georgia was abandoned when President Obama was elected and the administration decided to pursue the ill-fated \u201creset.\u201d\n\nPence: \u201cLess than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.\u201d Kaine: \u201cNinety percent.\u201d\n\nKaine gets this right, as Pence repeated a false claim that is popular on the right. The Clinton Foundation does not dole out grants, like a typical foundation, but instead directs the donations it raises directly for specified charitable activities. So simply only looking at the grants does not tell the whole story about the foundation\u2019s activities.\n\nThe American Institute of Philanthropy\u2019s \u201cCharity Watch\u201d gives the Clinton Foundation an \u201cA\u201d rating for its efficiency (the top rating is A+). It says the foundation spends 88 percent of its expenses on programs and 12 percent on overhead. It also says the Clinton Foundation spends just $2 to raise $100.\n\n1 of 19 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Kaine and Pence face off during the vice-presidential debate in Virginia View Photos The vice-presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va.

October surprise, indeed.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton\u2019s die-hard opponents were hoping for an October surprise, they\u2019re going to have to wait.\n\nA Tuesday morning press conference by WikiLeaks, which Clinton antagonists and conspiracy theorists had hoped would spell the beginning of the end of her presidential campaign, turned out to be a celebration-cum-infomercial for the website, which celebrates its 10th anniversary today and is promoting a new book.\n\nEither WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, never really had the goods on Clinton, or Donald Trump and his supporters just got wickedly trolled.\n\nFor months, WikiLeaks has been hinting that it would release damaging documents about Clinton in the home stretch of the presidential campaign. The group had posted embarrassing emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee in July, leaving the world wondering, what else does Assange have in his hard drive?\n\n\n\nEgged on by the apparently unfounded claims of Trump adviser Roger Stone that WikiLeaks had a campaign-ending document dump in store, anticipation reached a fever pitch. According to Google, the top trending question about Trump\u2019s opponent on Monday was \u201cWhat could WikiLeaks have on Clinton?\u201d\n\nTurns out, probably not much. There was no spectacular release of private emails. No bombshells about the Clinton Foundation or brain tumors. Instead, Assange and some of his WikiLeaks colleagues used the press conference to make a pitch for donations and to note the remarkable quantity of the site\u2019s work\u201410 million documents published, containing more than 10 billion words, which the group claims is \u201cmore secret documents than the rest of the world\u2019s media combined.\u201d\n\nWith legions of Trump supporters and Clinton haters feeling deceived, Stone claimed that Assange had never promised a big reveal.\n\n\"Not at all what he said,\" Stone wrote in an email to The Daily Beast, adding that journalists had engaged in \"wishful thinking.\"\n\nStone had already seemed to tamp down expectations ahead of the press conference, which was streamed live at 4 a.m. Eastern time.\n\n\u201cAssange correctly fears for his life because he has the deep secrets of the Deep State and he\u2019s getting ready to spill the beans,\u201d Stone said on The Alex Jones Show on Monday, explaining why Assange must have changed his earlier plans to hold the press conference from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he lives in a self-imposed exile. WikiLeaks held the event in Berlin instead, and Assange joined via video.\n\n\u201cBill and Hillary Clinton know that it\u2019s handcuff time and they\u2019re apoplectic,\u201d Stone said.\n\nWhat now appears more likely is that there was never an October surprise, at least not of the magnitude that Stone had been promising when he tweeted Sunday, \u201cWednesday@HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.\u201d\n\nSome Clinton opponents took that as gospel, perhaps because Stone has said he\u2019s in contact with Assange, whom he recently described as \u201cmy hero.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks, however, batted down the suggestion that Tuesday was some kind of D-Day.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Assange said that the \u201csignificant\u201d disclosures would cover the U.S. election and Google, but he gave no precise details about when they would occur.\n\nClinton\u2019s most fervent antagonists were outraged.\n\n\u201cJulian Assange trolling the world is Hillary\u2019s October surprise,\u201d Jones declared in a Tuesday morning tirade. Jones, who had covered the press conference live on his website Infowars, had promised his followers that Assange had a revelation that \u201ccould swing the election against Hillary if it catches fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was promising this damning evidence and he doesn\u2019t release it now 34 days out and now he\u2019s saying he\u2019ll release it by the end of the year so that smacks of a sell-out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably out of documents.\u201d\n\nBut some people would still like to know where Assange is getting those documents. At a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee last month, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) asked FBI Director James Comey whether law-enforcement officials had interviewed Stone \u201cabout his communications with Julian Assange or his knowledge of how WikiLeaks got these illegally obtained documents,\u201d referring to the hacked DNC emails.\n\nComey declined to comment. Nadler also pressed the director on whether the FBI had talked to Stone about his claims to have \u201cknowledge about upcoming leaks of additional illegally hacked documents.\u201d\n\nComey again declined to comment and wouldn\u2019t say whether or not the FBI had opened an investigation into the matter.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials and computer-security experts suspect that WikiLeaks obtained the DNC emails from a source working on behalf of the Russian government, which is the prime suspect in that hack as well as other intrusions of U.S. political organizations, elected officials, and former government officials.\n\nDemocrats have been pressing the FBI to investigate in particular the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to the Russian government and whether Trump is benefiting from the breaches. Republicans, though, have refused to sign on to those inquiries, leaving the Democrats with few tools to pursue an investigation.\n\n", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/10/04/wikileaks-trolls-trump-world-delivers-nothing-on-hillary/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1475590108521.cached.jpg", "title": "WikiLeaks Trolls Trump World, Delivers Nothing on Hillary", "summary": "\u201cJulian Assange trolling the world is Hillary\u2019s October surprise,\u201d Jones declared in a Tuesday morning tirade.\nEither WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, never really had the goods on Clinton, or Donald Trump and his supporters just got wickedly trolled.\nFor months, WikiLeaks has been hinting that it would release damaging documents about Clinton in the home stretch of the presidential campaign.\nEgged on by the apparently unfounded claims of Trump adviser Roger Stone that WikiLeaks had a campaign-ending document dump in store, anticipation reached a fever pitch.\n\"Stone had already seemed to tamp down expectations ahead of the press conference, which was streamed live at 4 a.m. Eastern time.", "source": "Daily Beast", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Etc Authors S Shane-harris"], "keywords": ["jones", "conference", "stone", "documents", "clinton", "trump", "surprise", "assange", "hillary", "wikileaks", "press", "world", "trolls", "delivers"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-10-02 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/2/mike-pence-tim-kaine-in-spotlight-in-vice-presiden/", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s stumble in the first presidential debate and the rough week that followed upped the pressure on his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, to regain the campaign\u2019s footing with a strong performance in Tuesday\u2019s debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\nThe two men have a lot in common and lots of political experience, including stints on Capitol Hill and in governor\u2019s mansions. Both also were relatively unknown before being tapped for the No. 2 spot by their parties\u2019 famous, albeit polarizing, nominees.\n\n\u201cBoth of them are going to have to defend the top of the ticket. But after Donald Trump\u2019s performance last week, Kaine will probably walk in thinking he\u2019s got the advantage,\u201d said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.\n\nStrategists from both parties have applauded the way Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine have handled themselves on the campaign trail so far, saying they\u2019ve covered up some of their boss\u2019 blemishes.\n\nThey\u2019ve even left some political insiders wishing the veeps were atop the ticket.\n\n\u201cGovernor Pence has brought a depth of experience and a strong conservative record to the ticket, helping to unite conservatives and party leaders around Trump-Pence,\u201d said Phil Cox, a GOP consultant. \u201cHe\u2019s proven to be a strong, effective defender of Donald Trump and an important character witness for key segments of our party\u2019s coalition.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump\u2019s cocaine \u2018wore off\u2019 during debate, Gary Johnson is a \u2018f\u2014ing idiot\u2019 says Bill Maher\n\nOn the debate stage in Farmville, Virginia, Mr. Kaine likely will have to answer questions about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email setup as secretary of state, conflicts of interest from corporate and foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation and maybe her role covering up former President Bill Clinton\u2019s extramarital affairs.\n\nStill, Mr. Kaine enjoys an advantage from the past week\u2019s news coverage that focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s debate fumbles and his repeated defenses of calling 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d when she gained weight after winning the Trump-owned pageant that year.\n\nMr. Kaine, 58, a former Virginia governor, has a homespun style, boasts a relatively modestly lifestyle and often harkens to his working-class upbringing in a Catholic family in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\u201cMy folks weren\u2019t much into politics. My dad ran a union ironworking shop and my mom was his best salesman,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech the Democratic National Convention. \u201cMy parents, Al and Kathy, here tonight and going strong \u2014 they taught me about hard work, and about kindness, and, most especially, faith.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence, 57, describes himself as a \u201cChristian, a conservative and a Republican \u2014 in that order.\u201d\n\nBorn into an Irish Catholic family, Mr. Pence later became a member of an Evangelical Christian church, referring to himself as \u201cborn-again, evangelical Catholic.\u201d\n\nA polished public speaker, Mr. Pence is a former member of the House GOP leadership team and a former talk-radio host. But he\u2019ll be put the test because of the way the conversation has shifted since the Clinton campaign marched out Ms. Machado as part of its push to brand Mr. Trump as a sexist and anti-woman.\n\nMr. Trump hit back, bringing up the beauty queen\u2019s sex romp on a Mexican reality TV show, and teasing the idea that he is going to put more emphasis on Mr. Clinton\u2019s extramarital affairs.\n\nAs a result, the GOP establishment is hopeful that Mr. Pence can put an end to the tabloid-like atmosphere of the past few days and get the campaign back on track by refocusing the conversation on Mrs. Clinton and making the case that the nation can\u2019t afford another four years like the last eight.\n\n\u201cI think Mike Pence has to do what he does best, which is to show his substance, depth, his solid balance, his good judgment, his even temper, and his empathy \u2014 all of which have been hallmarks of his career and I think will turn up in the debate,\u201d said Fred Malek, a veteran GOP consultant. \u201cMany people I talked to wish the tickets were reversed \u2014 in which case you could be assured of a reasonably happy ending.\u201d\n\nThere was a generational chasm in last two vice presidential debates, with Joe Biden, 73, facing off against then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, 52, in 2008 and House Speaker Paul Ryan, 46, in 2012.\n\nMr. Kaine and Mr. Pence were born a little over a year apart, and each of them have at least 15 years of public service under their belts.\n\nWith health questions swirling around Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump having recently celebrated his 70th birthday, there has been more attention paid to the idea that Mr. Kaine or Mr. Pence could end up as commander in chief.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Ordinary investors in the new company, meanwhile, saw the value of their shares plunge to 17 cents from $35.50, while scores of contractors went unpaid for work on Mr. Trump\u2019s casinos and casino bondholders received pennies on the dollar.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe has a vast benefit from his destruction\u201d in the early 1990s, said one of the experts, Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University\u2019s Schack Institute of Real Estate. Mr. Rosenfeld offered this description of what he would advise a client who came to him with a tax return like Mr. Trump\u2019s: \u201cDo you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump declined to comment on the documents. Instead, the campaign released a statement that neither challenged nor confirmed the $916 million loss.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cMr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, emailed a letter to The Times arguing that publication of the records is illegal because Mr. Trump has not authorized the disclosure of any of his tax returns. Mr. Kasowitz threatened \u201cprompt initiation of appropriate legal action.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s refusal to make his tax returns public \u2014 breaking with decades of tradition in presidential contests \u2014 has emerged as a central issue in the campaign, with a majority of voters saying he should release them. Mr. Trump has declined to do so, and has said he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAt last Monday\u2019s presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton suggested Mr. Trump was refusing to release his tax returns so voters would not know \u201che\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d and when she also pointed out that Mr. Trump had once revealed to casino regulators that he paid no federal income taxes in the late 1970s, Mr. Trump retorted, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThe tax experts consulted by The Times said nothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, even if the extraordinary size of the loss he declared would have probably attracted extra scrutiny from I.R.S. examiners. \u201cThe I.R.S., when they see a negative $916 million, that has to pop out,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe documents examined by The Times represent a small fraction of the voluminous tax returns Mr. Trump would have filed in 1995.\n\nThe documents consisted of three pages from what appeared to be Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. The pages were mailed last month to Susanne Craig, a reporter at The Times who has written about Mr. Trump\u2019s finances. The documents were the first page of a New York State resident income tax return, the first page of a New Jersey nonresident tax return and the first page of a Connecticut nonresident tax return. Each page bore the names and Social Security numbers of Mr. Trump and Marla Maples, his wife at the time. Only the New Jersey form had what appeared to be their signatures.\n\nThe three documents arrived by mail at The Times with a postmark indicating they had been sent from New York City. The return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Times presented the tax documents to Jack Mitnick, a lawyer and certified public accountant who handled Mr. Trump\u2019s tax matters for more than 30 years, until 1996. Mr. Mitnick was listed as the preparer on the New Jersey tax form.\n\nMr. Mitnick, 80, now semiretired and living in Florida, said that while he no longer had access to Mr. Trump\u2019s original returns, the documents appeared to be authentic copies of portions of Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. Mr. Mitnick said the signature on the tax preparer line of the New Jersey tax form was his, and he readily explained an obvious anomaly in the way especially large numbers appeared on the New York tax document.\n\nA flaw in the tax software program he used at the time prevented him from being able to print a nine-figure loss on Mr. Trump\u2019s New York return, he said. So, for example, the loss of \u201c-915,729,293\u201d on Line 18 of the return printed out as \u201c5,729,293.\u201d As a result, Mr. Mitnick recalled, he had to use his typewriter to manually add the \u201c-91,\u201d thus explaining why the first two digits appeared to be in a different font and were slightly misaligned from the following seven digits.\n\n\u201cThis is legit,\u201d he said, stabbing a finger into the document.\n\nBecause the documents sent to The Times did not include any pages from Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 federal tax return, it is impossible to determine how much he may have donated to charity that year. The state documents do show, though, that Mr. Trump declined the opportunity to contribute to the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial Fund, the New Jersey Wildlife Conservation Fund or the Children\u2019s Trust Fund. He also declined to contribute $1 toward public financing of New Jersey\u2019s elections for governor.\n\nThe tax documents also do not shed any light on Mr. Trump\u2019s claimed net worth of about $2 billion at that time. This is because the complex calculations of business deductions that produced a tax loss of $916 million are a separate matter from how Mr. Trump valued his assets, the tax experts said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNor does the $916 million loss suggest that Mr. Trump was insolvent or effectively bankrupt in 1995. The cash flow generated by his various businesses that year was more than enough to service his various debts.\n\nBut fragmentary as they are, the documents nonetheless provide new insight into Mr. Trump\u2019s finances, a subject of intense scrutiny given Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on his business record during the presidential campaign.\n\nBreaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.\n\nThe documents show, for example, that while Mr. Trump reported $7.4 million in interest income in 1995, he made only $6,108 in wages, salaries and tips. They also suggest Mr. Trump took full advantage of generous tax loopholes specifically available to commercial real estate developers to claim a $15.8 million loss in 1995 on his real estate holdings and partnerships.\n\nBut the most important revelation from the 1995 tax documents is just how much Mr. Trump may have benefited from a tax provision that is particularly prized by America\u2019s dynastic families, which, like the Trumps, hold their wealth inside byzantine networks of partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations.\n\nThe provision, known as net operating loss, or N.O.L., allows a dizzying array of deductions, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and even operating losses to flow from the balance sheets of those partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations onto the personal tax returns of men like Mr. Trump. In turn, those losses can be used to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income from, say, book royalties or branding deals.\n\nBetter still, if the losses are big enough, they can cancel out taxable income earned in other years. Under I.R.S. rules in 1995, net operating losses could be used to wipe out taxable income earned in the three years before and the 15 years after the loss. (The effect of net operating losses on state income taxes varies, depending on each state\u2019s tax regime.)\n\nThe tax experts consulted by The Times said the $916 million net operating loss declared by Mr. Trump in 1995 almost certainly included large net operating losses carried forward from the early 1990s, when most of Mr. Trump\u2019s key holdings were hemorrhaging money. Indeed, by 1990, his entire business empire was on the verge of collapse. In a few short years, he had amassed $3.4 billion in debt \u2014 personally guaranteeing $832 million of it \u2014 to assemble a portfolio that included three casinos and a hotel in Atlantic City, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, an airline and a huge yacht.\n\nReports that year by New Jersey casino regulators gave glimpses of the balance sheet carnage. The Trump Taj Mahal casino reported a $25.5 million net loss during its first six months of 1990; the Trump\u2019s Castle casino lost $43.5 million for the year. His airline, Trump Shuttle, lost $34.5 million during just the first six months of that year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSimply put, the organization is in dire financial straits,\u201d the casino regulators concluded.\n\nPhoto\n\nReports by New Jersey\u2019s casino regulators strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had claimed large net operating losses on his taxes in the early 1990s. Their reports, for example, revealed that Mr. Trump had carried forward net operating losses in both 1991 and 1993. What\u2019s more, the reports said the losses he claimed were large enough to virtually cancel out any taxes he might owe on the millions of dollars of debt that was being forgiven by his creditors. (The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be taxable income.)\n\nBut crucially, the casino regulators redacted the precise size of the net operating losses in the public versions of their reports. Two former New Jersey officials, who were privy to the unredacted documents, could not recall the precise size of the numbers, but said they were substantial.\n\nPolitico, which previously reported that Mr. Trump most likely paid no income taxes in 1991 and 1993 based on the casino commission\u2019s description of his net operating losses, asked Mr. Trump to comment. \u201cWelcome to the real estate business,\u201d he replied in an email.\n\nNow, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records, the degree to which he spun all those years of red ink into tax write-off gold may finally be apparent.\n\nMr. Mitnick, the lawyer and accountant, was the person Mr. Trump leaned on most to do the spinning. Mr. Mitnick worked for a small Long Island accounting firm that specialized in handling tax issues for wealthy New York real estate families. He had long handled tax matters for Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, and he said he began doing Donald Trump\u2019s taxes after Mr. Trump turned 18.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump\u2019s finances without Mr. Trump\u2019s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump\u2019s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump\u2019s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump\u2019s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked more questions.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut if Mr. Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of the tax code, and if he rarely showed any interest in the details behind various tax strategies, Mr. Mitnick said he clearly grasped the critical role taxes would play in helping him build wealth. \u201cHe knew we could use the tax code to protect him,\u201d Mr. Mitnick said.\n\nAccording to Mr. Mitnick, Mr. Trump\u2019s use of net operating losses was no different from that of his other wealthy clients. \u201cThis may have had a couple extra digits compared to someone else\u2019s operation, but they all benefited in the same way,\u201d he said, pointing to the $916 million loss on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d his 1987 best-selling book, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Mitnick as \u201cmy accountant\u201d \u2014 although he misspelled his name. Mr. Trump described consulting with Mr. Mitnick on the tax implications of deals he was contemplating and seeking his advice on how new federal tax regulations might affect real estate write-offs.\n\nMr. Mitnick, though, said there were times when even he, for all his years helping wealthy New Yorkers navigate the tax code, found it difficult to face the incongruity of his work for Mr. Trump. He felt keenly aware that Mr. Trump was living a life of unimaginable luxury thanks in part to Mr. Mitnick\u2019s ability to relieve him of the burden of paying taxes like everyone else.\n\n\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/02/us/01trumptaxes1/01trumptaxes1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump Tax Records Show He Could Have Avoided Taxes for Nearly Two Decades, The Times Found", "summary": "In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump\u2019s finances without Mr. Trump\u2019s consent.\n\u201cThat being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.\u201dThe statement continued, \u201cMr.\nHe had long handled tax matters for Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C.

It is most commonly known among linguists as \"paralipsis\" (\"to leave to the side\"), a tool employed by the great Roman debater Cicero and Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift that allows a speaker to effectively say two things at once.\n\nThe pattern has played out repeatedly over the past 15 months of campaigning: Trump tells you he won't say something negative about a rival, and in so promising, does it anyway. He's used the device in talking about Bill and Hillary Clinton, a former Miss Universe, and past primary opponents including Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson, among others.\n\nMore than 80 million people heard it Monday night, in the closing minutes of Trump's first face-off with Hillary Clinton, when he told viewers that, despite plans to level an \"extremely rough\" charge against Clinton and her family, \"I said to myself, I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Trump turned it up a notch.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,\" he told CNN's Dana Bash in the spin room as he raised the infidelity issue he'd skirted on stage, \"because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton, and I just didn't want to say what I was going to say.\"\n\nAnd there it was: Trump had not discussed the former president's extramarital affairs, except, of course, that he was quite obviously standing there, discussing the former president's extramarital affairs.\n\n\"Donald Trump uses paralipsis, repeatedly, and he does it in combination with another rhetorical figure, which is called argumentum ad baculum -- or threats of force,\" Dr. Jennifer Mercieca, an expert on political discourse at Texas A&M University, told CNN. \"He implied that there was something that he was going to say, that he wanted to say, about Bill Clinton and infidelity, but that he wasn't.\"\n\n\"It was a threat,\" she said, \"be nice to me or I'm going bring out these terrible things. And I think that's what we've seen from the surrogates, and from him, since the debates, so it keeps being lorded over the Clinton campaign's head -- that this thing is coming.\"\n\nThe device may be thousands of years old, but Trump has employed it in new and, at least in the modern American context, surprising ways.\n\n\"I've never seen anyone in public life use paralipsis the way he does,\" Mercieca said. \"It's a clearly demagogic move. It allows him to recirculate information without being held accountable for it.\"\n\nSuch was the purpose during Trump's Wednesday night interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, which followed more than a day of being questioned and criticized for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.\n\n\"So a lot of things are coming out about her,\" he said. \"I'm not going to say anything.\"\n\nPressed to comment on whether Clinton had taken a \"cheap shot\" by bringing up Machado during the debate, Trump started in on the former beauty queen after vowing he wouldn't.\n\n\"A lot of things are coming out that I wasn't aware of, like they say that she threatened the life of a judge and got involved in all sorts of problems,\" he said.\n\nDuring an August 2015 rally in New Hampshire, when Fiorina was enjoying a brief uptick in the GOP primary race, Trump observed that she had been \"a little nasty\" to him.\n\n\"So I promised that I wouldn't say, so I said it to myself, I promised I wouldn't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground,\" he said to hoots from supporters. \"I said I will not say it -- that her stock value tanked. That she laid off tens of thousands of people and she got viciously fired.

Is that OK with you people? I refuse to say that he's a lightweight.\"\n\nAnd then Ben Carson:\n\n\"Carson is an enigma to me,\" he said, prompting someone in the audience to yell, \"Boring!' Without missing a beat, Trump replied, \"I didn't say it!\" Then he smiled and pointed into the crowd.\n\nAsked months later by a Washington Post reporter if he would quietly concede in the event he lost a narrow race to Clinton, Trump once again found inspiration in Ancient Greece.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about that,\" he said as he then began talking about it. \"I'm just saying that I wouldn't be surprised if the election ... there's a lot of dirty pool played at the election, meaning the election is rigged.\"", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160930210827-trump-statue-greek-illustration-super-tease.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump promises he won't say it, then he does", "summary": "\"So I promised that I wouldn't say, so I said it to myself, I promised I wouldn't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground,\" he said to hoots from supporters.\n\"He implied that there was something that he was going to say, that he wanted to say, about Bill Clinton and infidelity, but that he wasn't.\nAsked months later by a Washington Post reporter if he would quietly concede in the event he lost a narrow race to Clinton, Trump once again found inspiration in Ancient Greece.\nThe pattern has played out repeatedly over the past 15 months of campaigning: Trump tells you he won't say something negative about a rival, and in so promising, does it anyway.\n' Without missing a beat, Trump replied, \"I didn't say it!", "source": "CNN", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg"], "keywords": ["wont", "going", "promises", "clinton", "trump", "wouldnt", "things", "bill", "donald", "say", "does", "lot", "paralipsis", "told"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-09-30 19:20:00-07:00", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-live-updates-trailguide-trump-continues-attacks-on-former-miss-1475236542-htmlstory.html", "text": "Donald Trump said Friday that Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton was \"duped\" into using his comments about a \"disgusting\" former Miss Universe to attack him.\n\nTrump has repeatedly gone after 1996 Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, now a U.S. citizen living in Los Angeles, after Clinton brought her up in Monday night's presidential debate.\n\nShe said Trump called Machado \"Miss Piggy\" when she gained weight after the pageant, and \u201cMiss Housekeeping,\u201d a dig at her Venezuelan ethnicity.\n\n\u201cDonald, she has a name: Her name is Alicia Machado,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cShe has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she\u2019s going to vote this November.\u201d\n\nTrump told Fox News the next morning that the moment \"rattled\" him, and he's attacked Machado's character in a series of television interviews in the days since.

Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nClinton was ebullient as she returned to the campaign trail Tuesday in Raleigh, N.C., and strove to keep alive the controversies that marred Trump\u2019s debate performance.\n\n\u201cThe real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important, hardest job in the world, and I think people saw last night some very clear differences between us,\u201d Clinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane en route to North Carolina.\n\nTrump did little to change the subject. In a Tuesday morning interview on Fox News Channel, he said debate moderator Lester Holt, the anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d was biased, and the Republican complained about the quality of his microphone. Clinton jabbed him for that, telling reporters, \u201cAnybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s attacks on her weight are \u2018a bad dream\u2019 for former Miss Universe]\n\nTrump also disparaged a former Miss Universe pageant winner, Alicia Machado, for her physique. In the debate, Clinton raised Trump\u2019s past comments about the Venezuela-born woman, who was crowned Miss Universe at age 19 in 1996.\n\n\u201cHe called this woman \u2018Miss Piggy,\u2019 and then he called her \u2018Miss Housekeeping,\u2019 because she is Latina,\u201d Clinton said in one of the debate\u2019s more electric exchanges.\n\nThe next morning, Trump offered an indignant defense of how he dealt with Machado when he was a partner in the company that owned the Miss Universe contest.\n\nAt the Sept. 26 presidential debate, Hillary Clinton knocked Donald Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Here's what you need to know about Machado. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cShe was the worst we ever had,\u201d he said on Fox, adding: \u201cShe gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign sought to advance the story across media platforms, releasing a Web video featuring the beauty queen-turned-actor, now a U.S. citizen who lives in California, and arranging a conference call for reporters with Machado, who described the election as \u201clike a bad dream.\u201d\n\nLike Trump\u2019s feud this summer with the Muslim parents of a dead U.S. soldier, the Machado episode rapidly emerged as a microcosm of the campaign \u2014 and a test of whether Trump can expand his support beyond his base of aggrieved white voters, most of them men.\n\nMike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist who has been critical of the party\u2019s nominee, said Trump\u2019s comments about Machado were \u201chugely tone deaf.\u201d The debate overall, he said, was for many Republicans \u201can \u2018Oh, crap\u2019 moment. If you thought he had a spring in his step for the last few weeks and was getting back in the hunt, that\u2019s pretty much gone.\u201d\n\nFew of Trump\u2019s supporters went so far as to crown him the victor. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has been a weather vane for the Republican leadership during this election season, was supportive though muted at a Tuesday news conference. He told reporters that Trump gave a \u201cunique, Donald Trump response to the status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he gave a spirited argument,\u201d Ryan said, \u201cand I think he passed a number of thresholds.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s backers insisted that the debate would not damage his standing in the close race with Clinton. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said, \u201cAs far as the temperament, that\u2019s how he\u2019s been for the last 15 months. It got him to the top. . . . He does have the feistiness that I think 51 percent of the American people will like.\u201d\n\nWilliam J. Bennett, who served in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cabinet, said of Trump: \u201cWhen he loses his temper a little bit, many people see that as passion and as someone who\u2019s engaged in the fight and in what he believes. People forgive that \u2014 and a leopard can\u2019t change his spots.\u201d\n\n[Why even Republicans think Clinton won the first debate]\n\nIt will take several days before the political impact of Monday\u2019s debate becomes clear, but many Republicans said they were bracing for Clinton to get a bump in the polls. An estimated 84 million people watched the clash at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., making it the most-watched presidential debate in history.\n\nThe event reverberated around the globe. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox said Trump\u2019s behavior should alarm world leaders because he revealed himself to be \u201cignorant\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he speaks about the geoeconomic situation and the geopolitical situation and terrorism, he\u2019s absolutely ignorant, and he\u2019s only provoking us democratic leaders from around the world to reject everything he\u2019s proposing,\u201d Fox, who watched the debate on Mexican television, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe is an imperialistic gringo.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, the risk for Trump is that a negative impression sets in on shows such as NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d on social media and in workplace conversations.\n\nDemocrats sought to taunt Trump on his uneven performance, particularly given his regular attacks on Clinton\u2019s \u201cstamina\u201d and appearance.\n\n\u201cHe seemed unable to handle that big stage, and I really did feel that by the end, with the kind of snorting, the water gulping and the leaning on the lectern, that he just seemed really out of gas,\u201d said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nTrump previewed an even more combative second debate, Oct. 9 in St. Louis, by saying he might \u201chit her harder,\u201d perhaps over former president Bill Clinton\u2019s affairs.\n\n\u201cI really eased up because I didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings,\u201d Trump said on Fox, saying he would have brought up \u201cthe many affairs that Bill Clinton had\u201d but held back because the Clintons\u2019 daughter, Chelsea, was in the audience.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was worth the shot,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was nice.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton shrugged off the threat, telling reporters: \u201cHe can run his campaign however he chooses. I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American people.\u201d\n\nClinton campaigned at a community college gymnasium in Raleigh to whoops and loud applause. \u201cOne down, two to go,\u201d she said of the debates.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., Tuesday evening, Trump said that Clinton is \u201ca woman that I think is virtually incompetent, certainly as secretary of state.\u201d He called her incompetent repeatedly throughout the rally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get rid of that crooked woman. She\u2019s a crooked woman. She\u2019s a very, very dishonest woman,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFor Democrats, Trump provided what Plouffe called \u201can embarrassment of riches\u201d at the debate \u2014 a series of controversial statements and unresolved, damaging questions. He seemed to affirm that he paid no income taxes; he made side remarks and pained expressions while Clinton praised the vibrancy of African Americans; he said it was a smart business strategy to profit from the housing crash.\n\nVice President Biden seized on that last point at a rally for Clinton in Philadelphia, where he charged that Trump has no \u201cmoral center.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat in the hell is he talking about?\u201d\n\nClinton and a brigade of high-profile surrogates plan to continue using Trump\u2019s debate comments against him. She will campaign in New Hampshire on Wednesday with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), hoping to energize young voters there with a discussion of college affordability, while first lady Michelle Obama will stump across Pennsylvania on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe put a lot on the table \u2014 a lot of things that are not true and a lot of views that we think are counter to where most voters are,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director. \u201cIt won\u2019t end tomorrow. There\u2019s a lot that will live on from this debate.\u201d\n\nAnne Gearan in Raleigh, N.C., Jenna Johnson in Melbourne, Fla., and Jose DelReal in Washington contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/27/Others/Images/2016-09-27/hrc41474993391.jpg", "title": "As Clinton builds on a strong debate, Trump lobs attacks and complaints", "summary": "At the Sept. 26 presidential debate, Hillary Clinton knocked Donald Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.\n\u201cWhat in the hell is he talking about?\u201dClinton and a brigade of high-profile surrogates plan to continue using Trump\u2019s debate comments against him.\nAn estimated 84 million people watched the clash at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., making it the most-watched presidential debate in history.\nHillary Clinton responded to Donald Trump's performance at the first presidential debate Sept. 27, saying \"people can draw their own conclusions.\nIn the debate, Clinton raised Trump\u2019s past comments about the Venezuela-born woman, who was crowned Miss Universe at age 19 in 1996.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Philip Rucker Is The White House Bureau Chief For The Washington Post He Previously Has Covered Congress The Obama White House The Presidential Campaigns He Joined The Post In As A Local News Reporter", "Matea Gold Is A National Political Reporter For The Washington Post Covering Money Influence", "Robert Costa Is A National Political Reporter At The Washington Post"], "keywords": ["woman", "clinton", "trump", "campaign", "attacks", "think", "presidential", "machado", "trumps", "complaints", "strong", "miss", "debate", "lobs", "builds"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-09-27 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-focus-group-frank-luntz-hillary-clinton-winner", "text": "In a clash between the two most unpopular presidential nominees in modern history, a group of undecided voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania declared Hillary Clinton the clear winner; but remained deeply pessimistic about their choices in November.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like asking me to choose between a heart attack and a stroke,\u201d said one of the 27 voters selected and paid to participate in a focus group conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in Philadelphia on Monday.\n\n'Clinton weaponized Trump\u2019s words': the reaction to the presidential debate Read more\n\nThe visceral electoral anger that helped fuel Donald Trump\u2019s rise during the primaries was felt in the room at the National Constitution Center where the mood was perhaps best encapsulated by Luntz\u2019s opening question: \u201cHow the hell did we get here?\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania voters shared some of the same entrenched views that voters across the country have expressed over the past 18 months. They described Clinton as a \u201cliar\u201d, \u201ccorrupt\u201d, \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201cself-centered\u201d. They labeled Trump \u201cscary\u201d, \u201cfake\u201d, an \u201cegomaniac\u201d and a \u201cshape-shifter\u201d.\n\nThe battleground state voters watched the debate from a room inside the National Constitution Center while Luntz\u2019s team tracked their snap reactions throughout the 90-minute debate. On display behind the voters were large, expressionistic paintings of an American flag, John F Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Trump and Clinton by artist and GOP darling Steve Penley.\n\nAt the end of the debate, 16 of the 27 participants agreed that Clinton had won while just six believed Trump had won the debate. In near uniformity, the voters said the outcome of the debate was the result of Trump\u2019s failure rather than Clinton\u2019s success.\n\nAsked to react to their performances, the voters offered of Trump\u2019s: \u201cstrong start, weak finish\u201d, \u201cbombastic\u201d, \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201cverbose\u201d. When asked to respond to Clinton\u2019s performance, the answers were markedly positive: \u201cfirm\u201d, \u201cpowerful\u201d, \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cinformed\u201d.\n\nTrump struggled to defend himself against attacks by Clinton over his denigration of women, insensitivity on race relations and an assertion that he avoided paying federal taxes for years. The freewheeling Republican nominee repeatedly interrupted Clinton and drew sardonic laughs from both the audience in New York and the voters in Pennsylvania, when he claimed to have a \u201cwinning temperament\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe dug his own grave by just talking and talking,\u201d said one woman named Marti G, who described herself as truly undecided.\n\nOn the monitor tracking the voters\u2019 reactions to the candidates, which was visible to the handful of reporters observing the group, even those leaning toward the Republican nominee disapproved of his windy response when Clinton ticked off possible reasons Trump may not want to disclose his tax returns.\n\nAs the lines on the screen plummeted, Luntz, sporting a pair of American Flag Nike sneakers, bounded over to the small group of reporters. \u201cDonald Trump just got nuked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if he can recover from this debate.\u201d\n\nUntil that point, Trump appeared to be doing a better job appealing to the firmly undecided voters in the room. He was at his best when he was railing against the political system. But support for him cratered when he began to defend his years of questioning Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship.\n\nClinton wove the so-called birtherism issue \u2013 which she referred to as a \u201cracist lie\u201d \u2013 into a larger narrative, accusing Trump of having \u201ca long record of engaging in racist behavior\u201d. As she spoke, many of the voters in the room agreed with her, especially among those already leaning towards her.\n\nAfter the debate, the voters lamented that too much time was spent discussing birtherism. Overall the voters rated Clinton\u2019s response on issues of race higher than Trump\u2019s, and after the debate several people flatly labeled the Republican nominee a racist.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come to the black community because he wants our vote, not because he truly cares about [me] as a black person,\u201d said Ragni Lee, of Collegeville, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe group included women and men who were reluctant to support either candidate, including a lifelong conservative voter who would rather sit out than vote for Trump, a millennial who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary but has been persuaded by Clinton and a middle school teacher who says Trump \u201clost\u201d her when he began denigrating Muslims.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked at my Muslim students and I knew he was talking about them, he lost me,\u201d said Judy McDermott, who remains \u201creally undecided\u201d.\n\nHillary Clinton shows strength over Trump in one of history's weirdest, wildest debates Read more\n\nAnd yet some left the first debate impossibly conflicted and even more pessimistic than when they arrived.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is not a good candidate and Donald Trump is just a despicable person,\u201d Nicole Gerson, an attorney in Philadelphia, reflected after the debate. She said Trump\u2019s criticism of Clinton steered her away from the Democrat but not in his direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually thinking of voting for Gary Johnson,\u201d she said, naming the Libertarian candidate. \u201cMaybe the third party will finally become more viable so we\u2019re not left with such extreme candidates.

Here are some of the candidates' statements and how they compare with the facts.\n\nClaim: Donald Trump repeated his insistence that he was against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, claiming Clinton's assertions to the contrary were \"mainstream media nonsense put out by her\".\n\nReality Check verdict: Trump did not publicly speak out against the war before it started. On 11 September 2002, radio host Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported a potential invasion of Iraq. He replied: \"Yeah, I guess so\". During the debate, he tried to explain that away by saying the comment had been made \"lightly\". He said he had been arguing in private, to Fox News's Sean Hannity, that war would destabilise the Middle East, but we have no evidence to support that so far. He did start to express doubts after the invasion.\n\nClaim: Clinton attacked Trump over his boasts about his business acumen. \"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,\" Clinton said. \"He started his business with $14m, borrowed from his father.\"\n\nReality Check verdict: Trump says he received a $1m loan from his real estate mogul father. He also got loan guarantees and money from his future inheritance and inherited a share of his father's property holdings.\n\nClaim: Trump alleged that Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the \"gold standard\" of trade agreements. Clinton denied this but added: \"I did say I hoped it would be a good deal.\"\n\nReality Check verdict: We give this one to Trump. Clinton did more than express hope that the deal would turn out well and in a 2012 trip to Australia said it would be the \"gold standard\": \"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\"\n\nClaim: Clinton said: \"People have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs.\"\n\nReality Check verdict: Clinton has made this claim before. It is based on an optimistic reading of a report by Moody's Analytics, which says that most of the 10 million new jobs would be created anyway by an expanding economy. If all of Clinton's economic policies became law - which the report says is unlikely - they would account for 3.2 million of the 10 million jobs. The same company analysed Trump's plans and suggested they would tip the US into recession and lead to 3.5 million job losses - something strongly disputed by the Trump campaign.\n\nBut the two reports cover different time frames. The author Mark Zandi told CNN Money a more accurate comparison to the 10 million jobs created under Clinton would be 400,000 jobs lost under Trump, not 3.4 million.\n\nClaim: Trump has frequently tried to blame the rise of Islamic State militants on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This is his latest attempt.\n\nReality Check verdict: Possibly the strangest claim of the night. Clinton is 68 years old. The so-called Islamic State can trace its roots back to 1999, although it did not start referring to itself as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) until 2013. Read more here.\n\nClaim: Clinton accused Trump of calling calling climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese. He insisted \"I did not say that\".\n\nReality Check verdict: This claim relates to a 2012 tweet which Trump later said was a joke. He said: \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nClaim: Clinton said race determines how people are treated in the criminal justice system.\n\nReality Check verdict: This is a tough one to prove as there are no figures on the percentage of crimes that result in arrest. What we do know is that black people are locked up five times more frequently than white people. African-American people make up about 13% of the United States population. White people make up 64%. But black people make up 40% of the prison population, and white people 39%. It does not mean that black people, who tend to live more in urban, heavily policed areas, are five times as likely to commit crime however.\n\nClinton also claimed that African American men are more likely to be killed by guns than other demographics, something that is largely borne out by the statistics.\n\nClaim: Murders in New York city are up.\n\nReality Check verdict: As so often with crime statistics it depends how you slice it. The murder rate in New York city is close to record lows but did increase slightly between 2014 and 2015, according to FBI figures. But the very latest figures from the New York Police Department show murder rates are down 4% on 2015.\n\nMurder rates across the US as a whole went up 10.8% in 2015, the biggest single-year percentage jump since 1971, with a big spike in a handful of cities including Chicago, Washington DC and Baltimore.\n\nTrump also claimed that \"stop and frisk\" tactics \"worked very well in New York\" and brought crime rates down. This is hotly disputed by researchers and commentators . Violent crime rates have continued to decline in New York, as part of a long term trend, even though the number of \"stop and frisk\" searches has gone down dramatically in recent years. Research by Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University found indiscriminate searches had little effect on crime, although his research also found crime was reduced when police stopped and frisked civilians after observing someone acting violently, selling drugs or \"casing a joint\".\n\nClaim: Trump says he can't release his tax returns because he is in the middle of a tax audit. He also says publishing them would not reveal much.\n\nClinton suggests he will never publish them as they might reveal he is not as rich as he says he is, does not pay Federal tax and does not give as much to charity as claimed.\n\nReality Check verdict: Being audited by the Internal Revenue Service does not prohibit the release of tax returns. They would reveal Trump's annual income, how much he pays in tax and how much he gives to charity. Trump claims he has given $102m to charity in the past five years, but a Washington Post investigation could not find any cash donated by Trump's businesses after 2008. Trump's actual wealth has been assessed by Forbes at $4.5bn, compared with the $10bn he claims.\n\nInterestingly, Trump has never provided evidence that he is actually under audit by the tax authorities. According to Associated Press, a letter released by his tax lawyers never used the word, merely describing his tax returns as under continuous review.\n\nReporting by Brian Wheeler", "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/11DF9/production/_91390237_check_afp976.jpg", "title": "Reality Check: First Clinton v Trump presidential debate", "summary": "\"Reality Check verdict: Trump says he received a $1m loan from his real estate mogul father.\nReality Check verdict: Trump did not publicly speak out against the war before it started.\n\"Reality Check verdict: Clinton has made this claim before.\nReality Check verdict: This claim relates to a 2012 tweet which Trump later said was a joke.\nReality Check verdict: This is a tough one to prove as there are no figures on the percentage of crimes that result in arrest.", "source": "BBC News", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": [], "keywords": ["clinton", "trump", "crime", "million", "tax", "check", "verdict", "york", "v", "jobs", "reality", "debate", "presidential", "trumps"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "None", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/five-debate-storylines-watch-n654261", "text": "First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton set to debate; 100M viewers expected 3:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nHEMPSTEAD, NY -- Well, we're finally here: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tonight square off in their first presidential debate at Hofstra University, making it arguably the most consequential night so far of the 2016 election. The stakes are enormous, with recent polls showing the national race ranges from a six-point lead for Clinton (in the NBC/WSJ) to a dead-even tie (in Bloomberg's). There are five storylines we're watching heading into the debate.\n\nWhich Donald Trump shows up? After observing him over the last 15 months, including during the GOP debate season, we're pretty confident who Trump is -- he's aggressive, loaded with zingers and oppo hits, and shaky on policy. But there the possibility that a different Trump could show up tonight. But if we were in Las Vegas, we'd bet heavily on the Trump we know showing up. (Just see Trump's Gennifer Flowers tweet from over the weekend.)\n\nWhich Hillary Clinton comes to play? Meanwhile, we've spent the last eight years watching Clinton at presidential debates, and she's good. (Remember, she's a former lawyer.) Clinton was at her absolutely best last October in that first Democratic debate, where she ran circles around Bernie Sanders and her other opponents. But Clinton also has had some uneven performances -- think of that Democratic debate in Iowa right after the Paris terrorist attacks. And there was her game-changing rough moment when Tim Russert asked her about drivers' licenses for undocumented immigrants in Oct. 2008.\n\nHow does Trump fare in his first one-on-one debate? That's right. Tonight will be the first time that Trump has ever debated an opponent one-on-one. Indeed, he thrived (and sometimes simply survived) during the GOP debate season with as many as eight to 10 other Republicans on the stage. So even though he was always in the spotlight, he only had to speak 12-18 minutes in a two-hour debate. Tonight will be different.\n\nHow does Clinton fare in facing off against the ultimate Alpha Male? In his preview of tonight's debate, the Atlantic's James Fallows interviewed the famous anthropologist Jane Goodall. \"In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,\" Goodall said. \"In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.\" How Clinton responds could be one of the most important parts to tonight's debate.\n\nWhat happens in the first 30-40 minutes? As Politico's Shane Goldmacher observes, history has shown that most memorable moments of a debate typically happen early. \"That's when Al Gore first sighed, Mitt Romney knocked President Obama on his heels, and Marco Rubio, earlier this year, glitched in repeating the same talking point \u2014 over and over and over. It's when Gore tried, unsuccessfully, to invade George W. Bush's space, Richard Nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators' introductions!) and Gerald Ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, 'There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.'\"\n\nDo the debates really matter?\n\nThat's the fascinating question our colleague Dante Chinni asks. And his answer: not really. \"Looking at pre-debate NBC News/Wall Street Journal presidential polls and the final election results since 1992, there is only one campaign where the debate may have made a serious difference \u2014 2000. In every other case, the candidate that led going into the debates wound up winning on Election Day. And, to be fair about 2000, Democrat Al Gore actually did get more votes than Republican George W. Bush (but lost the Electoral College), so technically \u2014 where the popular vote is concerned \u2014 the numbers above show a perfect 6 for 6. The candidate that led in the poll going into the debate period won the election.\" On the other hand, 34% of voters in our new NBC/WSJ poll said that debates will be either \"extremely important\" or \"quite important\" in deciding their vote. Also, don't be surprised if the third-party vote in polls starts to drop after tonight. And how that vote gets distributed in the post-debate polls will be important to watch.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Trump vs. Clinton: Clash of debate styles, strengths 3:13 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nPlaying the expectations game\n\nNBC's Alex Seitz-Wald and Benjy Sarlin tee up tonight's debate. \"The good news for Trump, Republicans say, is that the expectations for his performance are about at rock bottom. While he's been more a more disciplined campaigner in recent weeks, he's struggled to stay on message and answer substantive policy questions. He also has never faced the bright spotlight of a one-on-one debate. His campaign, looking to reinforce his underdog image, claims he's eschewing typical debate preparations... Clinton, meanwhile, faces sky-high expectations. She's an experienced debater, having participated in nearly 40 debates since her first campaign for senate in New York 16 years ago, and has been holding marathon prep sessions at a debate camp set up in a hotel near her Chappaqua home.\"\n\nThe skinny on tonight's debate\n\nThe debate starts at 9:00 pm ET, and it lasts 90 minutes - divided into six 15-minute segments. Clinton gets the first question of the debate (on the result of a coin toss). About 1,000 audience members will be in attendance, and they are encouraged to remain quiet.

He keeps saying it anyway, including twice just last week during a rally in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nBut his repeated claims do not erase the record. It all starts with a September 2002 Howard Stern interview first uncovered by BuzzFeed, in which Trump responds to the question of whether he agreed with the Bush administration as it tried to sell the country on the need to go to war. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nFrom there, several other fact-checking outlets have uncovered instances where Trump hardly sounds like a peacenik. In an interview with Fox News in late 2002, about three months before the war began, Trump actually sounded impatient about George W. Bush\u2019s dithering on launching an attack. Then, speaking with the same network just two days after Bush announced the start of the war, Trump sounded a bullish note on how he thought the invasion would affect the economy, predicting the stock markets would \u201cgo up like a rocket.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t make his first public forays into the anti-war world until summer 2004, when he called the war a \u201cmess that we\u2019re in\u201d during a lengthy Esquire profile.\n\nClinton\u2019s claim: \u201cWhat I did [with emails] was allowed by the State Department \u2026\u201d\n\nThe truth: Those damn emails weren\u2019t \"allowed.\"\n\nThe former secretary of state has apologized and said she made a mistake in setting up a private server to use for work-related emails. \u201cI\u2019ve got no excuses,\u201d she told an Orlando, Florida, ABC station last week when asked about her trustworthiness in the wake of months of harsh headlines about how she communicated while running the State Department.\n\nBut Clinton has also been on shaky ground in how she\u2019s characterized the authorization she had for what she did. \u201cWhat I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn\u2019t the best choice,\u201d she said last October during a Democratic primary debate. She repeated that explanation in May when a national ABC News reporter broached the topic during an interview.\n\nIn fact, the State Department\u2019s inspector general explained in May that it found \u201cno evidence\u201d that Clinton requested help or got approval to set up her private email system. And if she had asked, Foggy Bottom wouldn\u2019t have given her the green light because of its own internal rules about federal record-keeping and the \u201csecurity risks\u201d associated with potential hackers.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even Clinton had ruled out the very same behavior she engaged in when it came to her State employees. Yes, that\u2019s her electronic signature on a June 2011 cable published by Fox News showing her ordering her federal employees to \u201cavoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claim: \u201cFifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.\u201d\n\nThe truth: Trump is way off on the data about black youth.\n\nTrump has been pretty upfront with African-Americans, urging them to drop their longtime loyalty to the Democratic Party because that support has amounted to little in the way of economic success. \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d he asked during a visit to Central Michigan last month.\n\nTo bring his point home, one of Trump\u2019s favorite riffs is about just how few young African-Americans have jobs right now. For example, during a stop in High Point, North Carolina, last week, Trump said that \u201c58 percent of African-American youth are not working.\u201d\n\nTrump should know better than to keep using that line. He\u2019s been flogged repeatedly by fact checkers for similar statements.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the latest data actually show that the unemployment rate for African-Americans ages 16 to 24 is 15.7 percent.\n\nThe Trump campaign maintains that it gets to the 58 percent figure by counting up both the young people who are trying to find jobs but can\u2019t get them and also the ones who are \u201cnot in the labor force.\u201d But that\u2019s a pretty misleading way of sizing up the situation. Under his definition, Trump is counting busy students as unemployed, whether or not they\u2019re looking for a job.\n\nClinton\u2019s claim: \u201cUnder [Obama\u2019s] leadership, we\u2019ve created 15 million new private-sector jobs.\u201d\n\nThe truth: Obama\u2019s jobs record isn\u2019t quite so rosy.\n\nPresident Barack Obama isn\u2019t on the ticket this year, but his economic agenda certainly is.\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder that Clinton won\u2019t budge from one of her favorite lines this campaign about the number of private-sector jobs that have been created since the economic collapse that crushed the country at the tail end of the Bush administration.\n\nHere\u2019s how Clinton said it earlier this month in front of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus: American businesses \u201chave created 15 million new jobs since the recession.\u201d At the Democratic National Convention in July, she said that since Obama took office, there have been \u201cnearly 15 million new private-sector jobs.\u201d\n\nThis is an overstatement by about 5 million jobs.\n\nClinton\u2019s measurements are based off the rock bottom of the economic collapse, which didn\u2019t come until February 2010, when Obama had been in office for more than a year. In fact, if she\u2019s going to claim a job number for the Democratic administration in which she served, she should begin with January 2009, when Obama was sworn in as president.\n\nSure, the country\u2019s economic situation in those initial months was still a byproduct of the Bush years, but it\u2019s the most complete assessment of Obama\u2019s time in office. And, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the net job growth in the U.S. during the current president\u2019s two terms is about 10.5 million new private-sector jobs.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim: Clinton supports \u201copen borders\u201d and a \u201c550 percent increase\u201d in Syrian refugees.\n\nThe truth: Trump is wrong about Clinton\u2019s plans for immigration and refugees.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s loudest applause on the campaign stump comes when he talks about building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, a barrier that he says the Mexicans will pay for. But the same applause lines about immigration that go over so well with adoring crowds have earned him the wrath of fact checkers.\n\nFor starters, Trump can\u2019t seem to accept that there are indeed solid numbers on how many illegal immigrants are in the U.S. \u201cIt could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is,\u201d he said last month. But the Department of Homeland Security in 2012 put out a figure on this exact topic: 11.4 million. And if he wants more recent data, he can go to the Pew Research Center, which earlier this week tallied up the total at 11.1 million in 2014.\n\nTrump is also inaccurate when it comes to his descriptions of Clinton\u2019s immigration stance. No surprise here, really, given that we are in a presidential campaign. But Trump said again last week during a North Carolina rally that his Democratic opponent was for \u201copen borders.\u201d In fact, her position includes supporting recent immigration legislation that sought to heighten the country\u2019s border security while installing a new system that finds people who have overstayed their visas and has them removed from the U.S.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan for handling the Syrian refugee crisis keeps getting similarly bungled by Trump. Last week provided the latest instance of this, when Trump issued a statement vowing to oppose Clinton\u2019s \u201c550 percent increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, there\u2019s no basis in that figure. Trump has taken a plan Clinton issued where she said she would welcome 55,000 additional refugees from the war-torn country over the course of a single year, and extrapolated it out at the same rate of expansion for the duration of a four-year term. On top of that, Trump\u2019s assumption implies Clinton would continue with the Obama administration\u2019s latest budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, where the U.S. would accept 100,000 refugees. Clinton, in fact, has said no such thing.\n\nClinton\u2019s claim: Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a thing in America except bankruptcies.\u201d\n\nThe truth: Actually, Trump has made some things in the USA.\n\nPlenty of fun has been had by Clinton and her entire campaign mocking Trump on the hypocrisy of his vows to bring jobs back to the U.S. when his own private businesses routinely look elsewhere for materials.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t make a thing in America except bankruptcies,\u201d Clinton said during a Philadelphia rally on the day after the end of the DNC. A week later in Colorado, she doubled down, \u201cNow, when Donald Trump is asked about where he makes things, he makes them anywhere else but America.\u201d\n\nTwo of her staffers even trolled Trump at his own New York skyscraper\u2019s gift shop, making a video of their summertime adventure buying a Trump shirt made in Lesotho, a Trump tie made in China and a Trump hat from Peru.\n\nBy all means, the Clinton campaign is on some solid ground for bashing Trump in going outside the U.S. for many of his products.

About 10 minutes later, he said, a half-dozen medics in riot gear took the man away and police dispersed the crowd.\n\nTyson said the protest had been tense but not violent up to that point. He said police started firing rubber bullets at the crowd and that one of them might have hit the man in the head.\n\n\u201cI heard no gunshot and I did not see any protesters with guns,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI\u2019m almost positive it was a rubber bullet.\u201d\n\nPolice declined repeated requests to comment on the account from Tyson or other witnesses.\n\nA group of clergy members who marched with the protesters Wednesday night offered a similar version of events.\n\nIn interviews with The Post, they said they saw no protesters with weapons and that the shot\n\n\u2014 described by some as a gunshot and others as a loud bang \u2014 rang out from the direction of police. None of them actually saw police fire their weapons, they said, nor did they see a civilian shoot a gun.\n\nDespite that, a tweet by Rev. Michael McBride, a regular MSNBC and CNN commentator who has worked with the Charlotte clergy members, suggested that a police officer shot the man. The tweet had been shared 2,400 times by Thursday morning.\n\nThe violence in Charlotte came less than a week after disputed police shooting of a black man in Tulsa \u2014 amplifying debates over policing and race that have been thrust open before in places such as Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore. The questions also are likely to get another national airing on Monday in the first head-to-head debate between GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn Tulsa, conflicting accounts over a police shooting last Friday have sharply divided the city, but have so far not touched off clashes.\n\nVideos made public this week show 40-year-old Terence Crutcher being shot, and then several minutes passing before an officer beings to render medical aid. Activists and others question why the medical assistance was not given immediately.

Leach said protesters felt \u201ctrapped\u201d and \u201cambushed\u201d by police when they entered the cramped intersection outside the hotel.

Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency and begin the process toward deploying the National Guard and the state Highway Patrol to assist local police, the governor said via Twitter. The violence that erupted during the demonstrations would not be tolerated, McCrory said during a late Wednesday interview on CNN.\n\n\"I understand concerns and I understand frustration and anger but I will never respect violence,\" McCrory said. \"Violence is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe demonstrations also prompted the mayor to issue a call for peace.\n\n\"We are urging people to stay home, to stay off the streets,\" Mayor Jennifer Roberts told CNN. \"Violence is not the answer.\"\n\nThe state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also condemned the violent protests.\n\n\"We support those who exercise the right to peacefully protest, and encourage the First Amendment right to call for redress of wrongs,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We understand efforts that undermine the legitimate calls for justice with unjust, random or purposeless acts of violence.\"\n\nCharlotte's bus and light rail services halted shortly after midnight, the Charlote Area Transit System said on Twitter.\n\nThe violence came one day after police shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, 43, who police say was armed and ignored commands to drop his weapon. Scott's family says the father of seven had a book in his hand. Word of the death stirred up anger in Charlotte and across the country.\n\nIn regards to the Wednesday night shooting, police responded to a call at about 8:30 p.m. ET Wednesday night and discovered a person with an apparent gunshot wound, police spokeswoman Cindy Wallace said in an email. The person was transported to Carolinas Medical Center, Wallace said.\n\nAs these details emerged, police in riot gear crowded downtown Charlotte as protesters shouted \"hands up, don't shoot,\" banged against a police van and broke a window of the City Smoke barbecue restaurant and bar. Police set off smoke bombs, which are sometimes used to disperse crowds.\n\nSixteen police officers were wounded in the violence that erupted Tuesday night in this North Carolina hub after word of the shooting spread across the country.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney, at a news conference Wednesday, rejected claims Scott was holding a book, not a gun, and said the gun had been recovered by detectives. No book was found, Putney said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story\u2019s a little bit different as to how it\u2019s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,\u201d Putney added.\n\nAs the city tried to cope with the sudden outbreak of anger and violence, students gathered Wednesday afternoon on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte as part of a silent protest. The campus is about a 20-minute walk from Scott's home.\n\nPeople put cargo from tractor trailers on a fire during protests. (Photo: Sean Rayford, Getty Images)\n\nAbout 200 students gathered at the student union with an already planned administration meeting scheduled, said Justice White of the school's Black Student Union.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus making others aware of police brutality,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happened in our front yard and it\u2019s important that we fight these stereotypes. People think we don\u2019t care as students, that we are off in our own world, and black people are made out to be these thugs, which just isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nStudent protester Katrina Williams is a young African-American woman and big sister to four boys 8-years-old and up.\n\n\u201cI fear from my brothers who are younger than me, and the things I\u2019ve gone through, I don\u2019t want them to go through,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to the Marshall Park gathering, special church services were also called at a half dozen places of worship.\n\nThe Charlotte Chamber of Commerce expressed its condolences to the Scott family, as well as to those injured in the protests, while calling on business owners to be prepared for any new violence. It said businesses should \"keep everything as normal as possible,\" but also take care to remove or chain down all tables, chairs, signs or planters.\n\nThe shooting took place four days after a Tulsa police officer fatally shot an unarmed black man who was standing outside his vehicle. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called for calm in both cities and across the nation. Lynch said the Justice Department opened a civil rights probe into the death of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa and was \"assessing\" Scott's death.\n\n\u201cThese tragic incidents have once again left Americans with feelings of sorrow, anger and uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 Lynch said. \u201cThey have once again highlighted \u2013 in the most vivid and painful terms \u2013 the real divisions that still persist in this nation between law enforcement and communities of color.\u2019\u2019\n\nGov. Pat McCrory issued a statement pledging support for Putney and Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts in their efforts to \"keep the community calm and to get this situation resolved.\"\n\nIn Charlotte, Putney said police dashcams recorded parts of the confrontation, and the videos were being reviewed. The African-American officer who shot Scott, identified as Brentley Vinson, was not wearing a body camera, Putney said.\n\nThe ACLU called on the police department to \"promptly\" release the videos \"in the interest of transparency and accountability.\" The advocacy group also demanded an explanation for why Vinson was not wearing a body camera.\n\nProtesters throw objects at police officers on I-85. (Photo: Sean Rayford, Getty Images)\n\nPutney said officers were searching for a suspect with an outstanding warrant Tuesday afternoon at The Village at College Downs when they observed a man \u2014 not the person they were looking for \u2014 inside a vehicle at the apartment complex.\n\nPutney said the man, Scott, exited the vehicle with a gun as officers yelled at him to drop it. Scott ignored the command and was shot by a Vinson, a two-year veteran of the force, Putney said. Vinson was placed on administrative leave pending the investigation.\n\n\"It's a tragic event, and my heart goes out to the Scott family for their loss,\" Putney said.\n\nSeveral residents at a condominium near the scene of the shooting said the neighborhood, which includes locals and University of North Carolina at Charlotte students, is quiet and safe.\n\nMichelle Cooke, a resident, said she learned of the shooting when her 12-year-old daughter came home from school and asked about the police tape and helicopters.\n\n\u201cIn this climate we\u2019re living in, the job of law enforcement is to protect lives as well as it is to protect themselves. Unnecessary shootings should not take place,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he did not point a gun, there is no reason to shoot\n\nhim. This is why the issue of Black Lives Matter is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor non-marginalized groups, who have not faced oppression, it might be hard to understand why we protest and say that black lives do matter,\u201d Cooke added.\n\nTemako McCarthy, whose son LaReko Williams died in 2011 after he was tasered by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police, arrived at the complex Wednesday afternoon to show solidarity with Scott\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cIf an officer is scared behind the trigger of a gun, that\u2019s scarier than a person who is walking down the street,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey need to have an outside sector come in, instead of taking care of this internally.\u201d\n\nSteve Knight, a white pastor at Charlotte's Missiongathering Christian Church, told USA TODAY he arrived at the scene about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. He said he talked to members of Scott's family as well as neighbors. All said Scott routinely sat in his car reading, waiting for his son's school bus.\n\nKnight, 41, said he questions Putney's version of events.\n\n\"I find it difficult to believe, the story that the police are telling,\" he said. \"Until we see video from the scene, and we see a gun, I for one am personally not going to believe that story.\"\n\nGeorge Shears III, pastor at Greater Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church in Charlotte, said the demonstration started out peaceful but \"began to boil over very quickly.\"\n\nBy 11 p.m., some protesters were throwing rocks and bottles at police, who remained stoic, Shears said. He said he left when police began firing tear gas.\n\nPolice clash with protestors as residents and activists protest the death of Keith Scott in Charlotte.

In a handwritten journal, he warned that bombs would resound in the streets and prayed he'd be martyred rather than caught, authorities say.\n\nAhmad Khan Rahami's jihad journal ended with a stark message, according to court papers:\n\n\"Death to your oppression.\"\n\nFederal court complaints filed Tuesday gave a chilling glimpse into what authorities say motivated the Afghan-born U.S. citizen to set off explosives last weekend in New York City and New Jersey, including a bomb that injured 31 people in Manhattan. The blasts came two years after the FBI looked into him but came up with nothing tying him to terrorism.\n\nRahami remains hospitalized with gunshot wounds from a shootout with police that led to his capture Monday outside a bar in Linden, New Jersey. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had a lawyer who could comment on the charges against him, which include federal terror crimes and state charges of attempting to murder police officers.\n\nRahami ordered citric acid, ball bearings and electronic igniters on eBay and had them delivered to a Perth Amboy, New Jersey, business where he worked until Sept. 12, the court complaints said. San Jose, California-based eBay Inc. noted that the products are legal and widely available and said the company had worked with law enforcement on the investigation.\n\nJust two days before Saturday's bombings, a relative's cell phone recorded Rahami igniting incendiary material in a cylinder buried in a backyard, the fuse being lighted, a loud noise and flames, \"followed by billowing smoke and laughter,\" the complaints said.\n\nAnd the complaints said in his bloodied journal - damaged by shots from his gun battle with police - he fumed that the U.S. government was slaughtering Muslim holy warriors and alluded to plans for revenge.\n\nOne portion expressed concern at the prospect of being caught before being able to carry out a suicide attack and the desire to be a martyr. Another section included a reference to \"pipe bombs\" and a \"pressure cooker bomb\" and declared: \"In the streets they plan to run a mile,\" an apparent reference to one of the blast sites, a charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey.\n\n\"The sounds of bombs will be heard in the streets,\" the journal declared.\n\nThere also were laudatory references to Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki - the American-born Muslim cleric who was killed in a 2011 drone strike and whose preaching has inspired other acts of violence - and Nidal Hasan, the former Army officer who went on a deadly shooting rampage in 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaints said.\n\nThe FBI has said Rahami apparently was not on its radar at the time of the bombing. But he was in 2014, when the FBI opened up an \"assessment\" - its least intrusive form of inquiry - based on comments from his father after a domestic dispute, the bureau said in a statement.\n\n\"The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism,\" the bureau said.\n\nA law enforcement official said the FBI spoke with Rahami's father in 2014 after agents learned of his concerns that the son could be a terrorist. During the inquiry, the father backed away from talk of terrorism and told investigators that he simply meant his son was hanging out with the wrong crowd, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nRahami's father, Mohammad, told reporters Tuesday he called the FBI at the time because Rahami \"was doing real bad,\" having stabbed his brother and hit his mother. Rahami was not prosecuted in the stabbing; a grand jury declined to indict him.\n\n\"But they checked, almost two months, and they say, 'He's OK, he's clear, he's not terrorist.' Now they say he's a terrorist,\" the father said outside the family's fried-chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Asked whether he thought his son was a terrorist, he said: \"No. And the FBI, they know that.\"\n\nThe FBI has faced questions before about whether it could have done more ahead of time to determine whether attackers had terrorist aspirations. The issue arose after the Orlando massacre in June, for instance, when FBI Director James Comey said agents a few years earlier had looked into the gunman, Omar Mateen, but did not find enough information to pursue charges or keep him under investigation.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama was confident the bureau would review Rahami's interactions with law enforcement \"to determine if there's something different that could have been done or should have been done to prevent the violence.\"\n\nMeanwhile, investigators are looking into Rahami's overseas travel, including a visit to Pakistan a few years ago, and want to know whether he received any money or training from extremist organizations.\n\nRahami's wife is thought to be a Pakistani national. On a trip to Pakistan in 2014, Rahami emailed his local congressman seeking help because his pregnant wife had an expired passport.\n\nDavid Duerden, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, was unable to confirm or deny reports that Rahami's wife had been questioned in the United Arab Emirates, which is home to a large expatriate Pakistani population and has airports that offer daily flights to Pakistan.\n\n\"We're aware of the reports but don't have any comment at this time,\" he told the AP.\n\nEmirati officials in Dubai and the federal capital Abu Dhabi said they had no information on her.\n\nFederal agents would like to question Rahami. But Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who received a classified briefing from the FBI, said Rahami was not cooperating; that could also be a reflection of his injuries.\n\nRahami, who came to the U.S. as a child, studied criminal justice for a time at a community college, and he worked as an unarmed night guard for two months in 2011 at an AP administrative technology office in Cranbury, New Jersey. At the time, he was employed by Summit Security, a private contractor.\n\nAP global security chief Danny Spriggs said he learned this week that Rahami worked there and often engaged colleagues in long political discussions, expressing sympathy for the Taliban and disdain for U.S. military action in Afghanistan. Rahami left that job in 2011 because he wanted to take a trip to Afghanistan, Spriggs said.\n\nAP spokesman Paul Colford said the news cooperative told law enforcement officials about Rahami's work at the Cranbury facility.\n\nSummit's vice president of security services, Daniel Sepulveda, said Rahami last worked for the company in 2011. Sepulveda said he was unaware of any complaints about Rahami's conduct.\n\n___\n\nEric Tucker reported from Washington.

A senior law enforcement official said that no evidence had yet been uncovered that he had received military training abroad.\n\nThe senior law enforcement official said agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation were examining Mr. Rahami\u2019s electronic devices as part of an effort to determine if he was inspired or directed by the Islamic State or any other terrorist organization.\n\nVideo\n\nAssistant Director William F. Sweeney, who heads the F.B.I.\u2019s New York office, said investigators had not found any indication that there is a terrorist cell operating in the area or in the city, he said.\n\nThe arrest was the culmination of a sweeping, connect-the-dots manhunt that grew in urgency as the police and F.B.I. agents pieced together clues gleaned from both high-tech investigative tools and practiced detective work.\n\nThe weekend began with what seemed like an odd and troubling event, but one that hardly aroused widespread alarm.\n\nAt 9:30 a.m., three pipe bombs tied together blew apart a trash can just before the scheduled start of a Marine Corps run called Seaside Semper Five in Seaside Park, N.J.\n\nOnly one of the three bombs had detonated and no one was injured. The F.B.I. was brought in to investigate, but there was no indication about what would unfold 11 hours later.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInvestigators believe that Mr. Rahami drove a car registered to his father into New York City shortly before the Chelsea blast erupted at 8:30 p.m.\n\nIn a review of surveillance video, the police later saw him near West 23rd Street and Avenue of the Americas wearing a backpack investigators believe contained one pressure cooker bomb. He was pulling a patterned duffle-type rolling bag that they believe contained another pressure cooker bomb and wearing a fanny pack on his left hip.\n\nA short time later, a powerful explosion sent debris flying and shattered windows up and down the block. The bomb, filled with shrapnel and placed under a Dumpster on the busy crosstown thoroughfare, injured 29 people.\n\nCity streets were soon locked down and a tip to 911 led the police to a second device, the other pressure cooker bomb with a cellphone attached, four blocks to the north. Surveillance video collected by investigators would later show Mr. Rahami on West 27th Street, without his backpack but pulling the patterned bag and leaving it beside a mailbox.\n\nBut it would take hours to gather and analyze all of that video and zero in on Mr. Rahami as the man who left the bag behind.\n\nAll officials knew on Saturday night was that someone had deliberately placed bombs on a city street. Mayor Bill de Blasio was hesitant to call it an act of terrorism, and officials cautioned against linking the attack to the explosion in New Jersey.\n\nThe unexploded bomb found on West 27th Street, however, held critical clues. Once the police were able to remove it and examine it, they discovered a fingerprint that matched one in an arrest record for Mr. Rahami.\n\nThey also found similarities between the New York and New Jersey bombs, leading them to reverse their conclusion that they were not linked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost or all used old-style flip phones \u2014 an LG and a Samsung on the two Manhattan devices and an LG in Seaside Park \u2014 as timers, with Christmas-tree-style lights as initiators, the officials said. They said HMTD, an explosive compound, served as the detonator and a compound similar to a commercial explosive known as Tannerite served as the main charge in some devices.\n\nRoughly 20 minutes after Mr. Rahami left the bag on West 27th Street, two men happened upon the luggage, apparently unaware of its explosive contents. One of the men opened the bag, pulled out the bomb, which was inside a white plastic bag, and then left with the luggage. The authorities, who are eager to talk to the men, said that their handling of the device may have disabled it.\n\nBy Sunday, the authorities were monitoring addresses associated with Mr. Rahami. Increasingly confident that he was involved with the bombings, they made the decision to act when they saw a vehicle leaving one of those addresses.\n\nThe car was pulled over on the Belt Parkway near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Brooklyn. Five people inside, some of them Mr. Rahami\u2019s relatives, were questioned and later released.\n\nLater on Sunday night, the police received a report of a suspicious package near a train station in Elizabeth, N.J.\n\nVideo\n\nThe F.B.I., which responded, deployed a pair of robots to examine the bag and determined that it held five bombs, some of which were pipe bombs.\n\nAround 12:30 a.m., the robots tried to clip a wire to disarm one bomb and accidentally detonated it. No one was injured.\n\nThe location of the bag was not far from where the Rahami family ran a restaurant, and before dawn on Monday, federal agents and local police officers were swarming a neighborhood of low-rise apartment buildings and small businesses.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Come down!\u201d\n\nThe police stormed up the stairs that led to the two apartments above the restaurant. They brought down some of the suspect\u2019s relatives. Officers questioned them.\n\nOfficers also brought down a woman who looked about 30, draped in colorful shawls that did not cover her head, and a girl wearing pajamas. They were locked inside a squad car.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s father came down about 20 minutes later, handcuffed and wearing only shorts.\n\nAs investigators realized that all of the attacks were linked and that the bombs reflected a certain level of sophistication, they worried that the bomber would grow desperate and do something even more drastic.\n\nThey decided to take the unprecedented measure of using New York City\u2019s emergency notification system \u2014 typically for major weather events \u2014 to alert people in the region that a dangerous suspect was on the loose. Shortly after 7 a.m., millions of people in the region received the notification to be on the lookout for Mr. Rahami.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as the police scoured the area near the restaurant, Mr. Rahami was seeking shelter from the morning rain under a doorway of a bar, Merdie\u2019s Tavern in Linden, which is next to Elizabeth, trying to catch some sleep.\n\nAround 10:30 a.m. the owner of the bar spotted a man sleeping in the doorway, officials said.\n\nCapt. James Sarnicki of the Linden Police Department told reporters that an officer approached the man, later identified as Mr. Rahami, and when he woke him, he saw that he had a beard resembling that of the man on the wanted poster.\n\nThe officer ordered him to show his hands, Captain Sarnicki said, but instead, he pulled out a handgun, shooting an officer in the abdomen; the bullet struck his vest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe officer returned fire,\u201d he said. Mr. Rahami fled, \u201cindiscriminately firing his weapon at passing vehicles.\u201d\n\nOther officers joined the chase, and Mr. Rahami was shot multiple times. At least one other officer was wounded during the confrontation.\n\nShortly after 11 a.m., Mr. Rahami was in custody, splayed out beside the street, hands cuffed behind his back and his shirt rolled up, officers standing over him with their weapons drawn.\n\nMr. Rahami, blood pouring from a wound in his shoulder and splattered on his face, was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to University Hospital in Newark.\n\nDiego Jeronimo, 36, the owner of a store near where the gun battle unfolded, said he opened his front door and saw a police car parked lengthwise across the street, an officer with his back to him with his gun drawn using the car as a shield.

One hundred and ninety-two people were murdered and over 2,000 injured. Three days later, the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar lost power in an election that swung suddenly to the Socialist Party.\n\nThe attack, the deadliest in Spain\u2019s history, was seen by many as an al-Qaeda-inspired retaliation for the Aznar government\u2019s support for the already unpopular U.S. invasion of Iraq. In jihadist lore, this is a legendary success story: a terror attack that inspired enough fear to swing a Western election.\n\nThis story has been kicking around the back of my cabeza since Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, and I thought of it again after the explosion Saturday night in Chelsea. Demographic math and a basic failure by the celebrity demagogue to reach out beyond his base makes a general election win unlikely but hardly impossible. Trump can\u2019t be counted out until all the votes are counted.\n\nThough he\u2019s a uniquely unqualified candidate, I\u2019ve been concerned about an outside X-Factor event suddenly changing the emotional calculus of the electorate in ways that we would later regret. This could be a sudden economic collapse or a cyber October-surprise. But terrorism has always seemed the prime known-unknown.\n\nAfter all, terrorism is now a depressingly regular feature of American life. While no attacks have rivaled 9/11, we saw at least 45 thwarted terror plots in the first ten years after the destruction of the World Trade Center and in the last year alone suffered horrific losses in the San Bernardino and Orlando slaughters. But we have no template for the impact of an attack just before an American election.\n\nWe are in a long war, a \u201cgenerational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism,\u201d as Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said. Many attacks have been the result of lone wolves, darkly inspired rather directed by centralized terror organizations, like the Boston bombing. This risk won\u2019t evaporate overnight, no matter who is elected president in less than two months.\n\nTrump has based his campaign on fear and anger of the \u201cother,\u201d most infamously pledging to at least temporarily stop Muslim immigration to the United States (later dialed back to an ambiguous regional restriction). Fear of immigration, especially Muslim immigration, has been a mainstay not only of Trump\u2019s campaign but also his European dopplegangers in UKIP and Le Pen\u2019s National Front Party, which has been buoyed by repeated horrific jihadist attacks from Paris to Nice.\n\nTrump rarely loses an opportunity to exploit terror. Within minutes of initial fog-of-war reports about Saturday night\u2019s explosion in Chelsea, Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs that a bomb had gone off in New York and while \u201cnobody knows exactly what's going on but, boy we are really in a time\u2014we better get tough folks.\" Always classy, he then touted a new poll showing him 4-points up.\n\nHe has previously tried to make political hay of the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks, with less than successful results. But now we\u2019re 50 days from the election and polls show the race is tightening. To some extent, that\u2019s to be expected.\n\nBut after months of primaries and analytic navel-gazing this is real time, with 29 people injured by an explosion in the heart of New York, just a few blocks from The Daily Beast\u2019s headquarters. This came hours after an apparent IED exploded in Seaside, New Jersey, on the site of a U.S. Marine charity race, which had been mercifully delayed, curtailing casualties. There is still much we don\u2019t know about both detonations, but New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s statement calling the Chelsea bomb was \u201can intentional act\u201d but adding \u201cwe do not see a link to terrorism.\u201d A Saturday night stabbing of eight people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, by a man in a security guard uniform was claimed by ISIS on Sunday morning, which issued a statement describing the assailant as \"a soldier of the Islamic State.\" This dark trifecta of weekend incidents one week after the anniversary of 9/11 all add to the drumbeat of anxiety which has driven many voters into the arms of Trump, someone they see as a strong man in chaotic times.\n\nMore detailed information will come in over the coming hours and days. But there\u2019s reason to fear this pattern could continue between now and November. Whether it is the work of lone wolves or something more coordinated, it doesn\u2019t take Nostradamus to see that terrorists view President Trump as an asset in their efforts to portray America as discredited and in decline. His divisive instincts play perfectly into ISIS\u2019 attempts to recast what used to be called The War on Terror as a war between America and Islam everywhere, rather than a rag-tag band of extremists, many radicalized remotely, parading under the broad banner of an apocalyptic death cult.\n\nIf this pattern continuing sounds unlikely, consider the fact that America\u2019s two biggest geo-political competitors, Russia and China, have been cheering the prospect of a Trump presidency, presumably because they see it as a harbinger of American decline and retreat from the world, despite all the tough guy rhetoric. It\u2019s a helpful bit of historical symmetry that \u201cAmerica First\u201d has consistently symbolized a flag-waving acquiescence to overseas dictators with bloody expansionist ambitions.\n\nThe fact that so many of the Republican Party\u2019s national security mandarins have declared Donald Trump unfit for office, should offer a reality check for reflexive Republicans and open-minded independents alike. The latest respected figure to join this chorus was former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \u201con national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform\u2026He is unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief.\"\n\nAgainst this unflattering backdrop, it\u2019s tempting to say that the hawkish former Secretary of States Hillary Clinton could be in a better position to benefit if, God forbid, terror attacks continue through the election. After all, she has a demonstrated record on national security and far more detailed policy proposals on how to deal with ISIS, (which admittedly isn\u2019t hard given Trump\u2019s laughable talk of a \u201csecret plan\u201d to the win the war.)\n\nBut sexism impacts negative perceptions of Hillary Clinton just as racism fueled many of the unhinged criticisms of President Obama, especially the Birther conspiracy theories that Trump did so much to pump up over the past five years. We have no national template for a Golda Meir-type leader in our country. There will be many who are susceptible to the idea that an older woman can\u2019t possible be as tough on terrorism as a blustery old man who loves to declare that he\u2019ll \u201cbomb the shit\u201d out of ISIS. \"Strong and wrong\" leaders have real emotional appeal during times of crisis. The certainty of the demagogue can be more compelling than the sober strategies offered by statesmen and stateswomen.\n\nAs we get more information, it may be that these incidents are not connected with terrorism but the ensuing drumbeat of anxiety only adds to Trump\u2019s desire to declare himself a prophet who warned about terrorism and immigration before it was cool. This all falls into his fear-based wheelhouse.", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/09/18/terrorism-the-ugliest-election-x-factor/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1474304947388.cached.jpg", "title": "Could a Terror Attack Elect Donald Trump?", "summary": "In jihadist lore, this is a legendary success story: a terror attack that inspired enough fear to swing a Western election.\nThe fact that so many of the Republican Party\u2019s national security mandarins have declared Donald Trump unfit for office, should offer a reality check for reflexive Republicans and open-minded independents alike.\n\"Against this unflattering backdrop, it\u2019s tempting to say that the hawkish former Secretary of States Hillary Clinton could be in a better position to benefit if, God forbid, terror attacks continue through the election.\nMany attacks have been the result of lone wolves, darkly inspired rather directed by centralized terror organizations, like the Boston bombing.\nThe latest respected figure to join this chorus was former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \u201con national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair.", "source": "Daily Beast", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Etc Authors J John-avlon", "John Avlon"], "keywords": ["elect", "trump", "attacks", "national", "attack", "immigration", "donald", "york", "terror", "isis", "security", "fear", "terrorism"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-09-14 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/14/obama-warns-nyc-donors-weird-stuff-happens-trump-might-win/", "text": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPresident Barack Obama warns that Donald Trump might beat Hillary Clinton in November, even with her efforts to tag him as a xenophobic bigot who does not represent America.\n\n\u201c[T]his shouldn\u2019t be close, but it\u2019s close,\u201d Obama told a group of donors in New York City on Tuesday. \u201cThe presidential race we should win, but Donald Trump got the nomination, so weird stuff happens.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe audience laughed in response to Obama\u2019s warning, but he urged them to invest to help Clinton across the finish line.\n\n\u201cI genuinely believe that the basic character of this country and our capacity to meet the challenges that all of you are aware of is dependent on what happens now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stakes are really high.\u201d\n\nObama mocked Republican party for their divisions, pointing out that he didn\u2019t even have to veto very much legislation.\n\nUnder Speaker Paul Ryan, he noted, House Republicans \u201ccan\u2019t even pass their own priorities\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t generally even have to veto anything because they can\u2019t get organized enough even to present the cockamamie legislation that they\u2019re interested in passing,\u201d he said, as the audience laughed.\n\nObama proclaimed that the election was the most important in the audience\u2019s lifetime, although he was self-aware that the argument had been used before.\n\n\u201cIt is a clich\u00e9 that every election is the most important in our lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I got to tell you, this one?

And it's possible that Trump tries to backtrack on his 'Birther' past at his campaign event in DC today. But there's a big reason why he can't escape it, no matter what he says: It's a key part of his political identity. Indeed, just look at these Trump statements AFTER Obama produced his birth certificate in 2011:\n\nAn 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012\n\nWhen I was 18, people called me Donald Trump. When he was 18, @BarackObama was Barry Soweto. Weird. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2012\n\nHow amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama\u2019s \u201cbirth certificate\u201d died in plane crash today. All others lived \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2013\n\nAttention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?) and check \"place of birth\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2014\n\n\"Who knows [if Obama is a natural-born citizen]? Who knows? Who cares right now? We're talking about something else, OK? I'm going to have my own theory on Obama. Someday I'll write a book, I'll do another book that will do successfully.\" -- Jan. 6, 2016\n\nSo for Trump's campaign -- or even Trump himself -- to backtrack on this 'Birther' past some 50 days before the election is like asking Hillary Clinton to backtrack on being married to Bill Clinton, or Bernie Sanders to backtrack on being a democratic socialist, or Barack Obama to backtrack on his fondness for Abraham Lincoln. It is part of Trump's political identity, and his political following started with this.\n\nIt isn't true to say Hillary Clinton or her '08 campaign started the Birther movement\n\nThe other part of the Trump campaign statement from last night -- in fact, it was its beginning -- was pinning the Birther story on Hillary Clinton. \"Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President. This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook.\" But that is untrue. While SUPPORTERS of Clinton stirred this conspiracy on the Internet, Clinton or her campaign NEVER said/suggested/insinuated that Obama wasn't born in the United States. As the Washington Post wrote last year, \"Clinton's campaign, one of the most thoroughly dissected in modern history, never raised questions about the future president's citizenship. The idea that it did is based largely on a series of disconnected actions by supporters of Clinton, mostly in the months between Obama's reaction to the Jeremiah Wright story and the Democratic National Convention.\"\n\nWhy Team Trump addressing the Birther story doesn't make much sense\n\nThe only way Trump addressing the Birther story makes sense is through the logic that \"any day the campaign is about you is a good day.\" Besides that, addressing it doesn't make sense. Either he doubles down on his past statements, which only complicates the campaign trying to woo African Americans and to seize on the \"Deplorables\" controversy. Or he repudiates his past Birther statements, which raises the question if he has a political core. How can you beat the Birther drums for five years and then say you're sorry 50-plus days before an election? If so, what does he believe? And what is he for? One other point here: With his poll numbers improving, Trump appears to be getting a little cocky (this, Dr. Oz, criticizing the African-American pastor). As we know, Hillary Clinton can sometimes be a terrible frontrunner. Maybe Trump isn't a good one as well\u2026\n\nClinton's message problem: It's not enough being against Trump\n\nSpeaking of Clinton, she's had a message problem since mid-August: It isn't enough being AGAINST Trump. She also to say what she's FOR. Indeed, this was a problem that both Mitt Romney and John Kerry had, and look how their campaigns turned. That said, Clinton's retooled stump speech yesterday started to get at the \"for\" issue. Some examples:\n\n\"But I want you, I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky when I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck, don't they?\"\n\n\"I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen.\"\n\n\"I've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I'm better at the service part than the public part, but this is why I do it and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that's what this race has always been about for me.\"\n\nMr. Kasich Comes to Washington (to talk about supporting TPP)\n\nFinally, guess who's also in DC today? Answer: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is meeting with President Obama to discuss promoting the TPP trade agreement. \"Friend, I will be in Washington, D.C. tomorrow to participate in a bipartisan discussion at the White House about the benefits of trade for job creation, innovation and improving national security,\" he said in an email to his supporters. \"Free trade is not only a powerful driver of job creation for Americans but it's also a national security issue. There's no better tool for America to encourage other nations to embrace freedom and equality than healthy trade relationships.\"\n\nOn the trail\n\nHillary Clinton gives a speech in DC to the Black Women's Agenda Symposium \u2026 Donald Trump is also in DC, where he holds a campaign event at 10:00 am ET, and then he holds a rally in Miami, FL at 6:00 pm ET\u2026 And Michelle Obama stumps for Clinton in Fairfax, VA at 3:00 pm ET.\n\nCountdown to first presidential debate: 10 days\n\nCountdown to VP debate: 18 days\n\nCountdown to second presidential debate: 23 days\n\nCountdown to third presidential debate: 33 days\n\nCountdown to Election Day: 53 days", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_37/1711426/160916-trump-cr-0527_1df6070d2a96c285d9763a40e18fcde5.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "title": "First Read: Why Trump Can't Escape His 'Birther' Past", "summary": "\u2014 Donald J.

This compares to a 51 - 41 percent Clinton lead in an August 25 survey of likely voters nationwide, by the independent Quinnipiac University\u2026.Independent voters tip to Trump 45 - 40 percent. Republicans go to Trump 86 - 10 percent, while Democrats back Clinton 92 - 4 percent. Voting for Clinton is the lesser of two evils, 38 percent of her supporters say, while 57 percent say she is the candidate they like. Among Trump supporters, 50 percent say they are picking the lesser of two evils, while 46 percent say he is the candidate they like. A total of 70 percent of likely voters say it is \u2018very important\u2019 or \u2018somewhat important\u2019 that the next president be someone to whom they can relate. But by similar margins, most American voters can\u2019t relate to either candidate. Voters say 61 - 36 percent they can\u2019t relate to Clinton and 64 - 34 percent they can\u2019t relate to Trump. \u201c [Quinnipiac]\n\nCBS/NYT also finds an increasingly tight race - Sarah Dutton, Jennifer DePinto, Fred Backus and Anthony Salvanto: \u201cWith the first debate less than two weeks away, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a tight race for the presidency nationally. Clinton has just a 2-point edge in a two-way match-up among likely voters. The race is tied when third party candidates are included. Among the broader electorate of registered voters, Clinton leads Trump by five points. One disadvantage for Clinton is diminished voter enthusiasm. Democrats are less enthusiastic about voting now than they were in August.\u201d [CBS]\n\nBreakdowns by demographic show where Trump and Clinton are strongest - More from CBS: \u201cA look at the candidates\u2019 demographic support also illustrates why the race is close. A gender gap remains: Trump has a double-digit lead over Clinton among men, while Clinton is ahead by a similar margin among women. Trump continues to struggle with African American voters but has an advantage over Clinton among whites. Whites without a college degree are strong supporters of Trump (58 percent back him), while Clinton leads Trump among white voters with a college degree. Clinton is ahead of Trump among voters under 30 but she is not getting the level of support Barack Obama received in 2012. 48 percent of young voters are currently backing her, while Obama won 60 percent of the young vote in 2012. Only 29 percent of young voters are supporting Trump, but 21 percent say they\u2019ll vote for someone else or won\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nWhat the average says - Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump has shrunk to less than 4 percentage points in the HuffPost Pollster aggregate. Clinton leads in eight of the 10 most recent national polls, but by narrower margins than in August. In polls that include Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson as an option, Clinton\u2019s lead is similar.\n\nThe patterns of polls narrowing during the fall campaign is familiar. For comparison, President Barack Obama was up by 4.1 points over Republican nominee Mitt Romney on Sept. 15, 2012 \u2015 and that was as wide as his margin got. Obama\u2019s edge narrowed to within half a percentage point in mid-October before widening to 1.5 points on Election Day. In 2008, the polls were also close through mid-September before the economic crash that spurred an Obama surge over Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nOHIO AND FLORIDA ARE SHAPING UP TO BE TRUE BATTLEGROUNDS - HuffPollster: \u201cOhio and Florida are both looking like close races in this year\u2019s presidential election, according to new polling released Wednesday that gives Donald Trump the edge in both states. Polls from both Bloomberg Politics and CNN in Ohio give Trump a 5-point lead over Hillary Clinton\u2026.A second CNN poll, in Florida, finds Trump up by 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent, with Johnson taking 6 percent and Stein 1 percent. In a head-to-head, Trump leads by 4 points.\u2026. In Florida, polls of head-to-head matchups taken since the beginning of September have all shown fairly narrow margins, ranging between a 2-point lead for Clinton and a 3-point lead for Trump. HuffPost Pollster\u2019s model, reflecting a set of far better results for Clinton during August, puts her over Trump by just under 3 points, although that\u2019s likely to drop if other surveys confirm CNN\u2019s results. In Ohio, recent polls have shown everything from a 7-point Clinton lead to a 5-point Trump advantage, but four of the five newest surveys give the edge to Trump. HuffPost Pollster\u2019s model shows Trump and Clinton effectively tied at about 43 percent.\u201d [HuffPost]\n\nThe situation in Nevada is similar - A new Monmouth University poll out on Wednesday showed Trump leading by 2 points among likely voters in Nevada. The last poll to indicate Trump leading was from late July. But since Clinton\u2019s leads in August polls were small, often only a point or two, the HuffPost Pollster average only has her leading Trump by about half a percentage point. [Monmouth]\n\nAMERICANS ARE WILLING TO PAY A LITTLE TO HELP COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE - Seth Borenstein: \u201cMost Americans are willing to pay a little more each month to fight global warming \u2014 but only a tiny bit, according to a new poll. Still, environmental policy experts hail that as a hopeful sign. Seventy-one percent want the federal government to do something about global warming, including 6 percent who think the government should act even though they are not sure that climate change is happening, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. And those polled said they\u2019d be willing to foot a little of that cost in higher electric bills. If the cost of fighting climate change is only an additional $1 a month, 57 percent of Americans said they would support that. But as that fee goes up, support for it plummets. At $10 a month, 39 percent were in favor and 61 percent opposed. At $20 a month, the public is more than 2-to-1 against it. And only 1-in-5 would support $50 a month.\u201d [AP]\n\nHUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Indeed, between 2000 and 2014, Springfield saw more of its middle class slip down the economic ladder than any other metro area in the United States, tying Goldsboro, N.C.\n\nYet Springfield is also a town of Kevin Roses, bounding 30-somethings who look at underutilized Victorian buildings just beyond the Crowell plant and see opportunity.\n\nYes, Springfield might not be the \"Champion City\" it once was, but in that history are the seeds of a renaissance. The promise of that future is right there, if only the city would grab it.\n\nThose two competing worldviews have played out across the country, as pressures on the American middle class have refracted politics. Trump is one manifestation. But much deeper is the concern that, for many, the future has already closed in front of them \u2013 and Washington seems chronically unable to stop it.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nUPDATE: With new Census data released Tuesday, there is hope that US economy might be finally turning a corner for everyone. Median household income rose by 5.2 percent from 2014 to 2015 \u2013 the first increase since 2007. The growth was even more robust for the lowest earners.

Congress instituted a temporary one to pay Civil War debts, but when it enacted a second one in 1894, the US Supreme Court famously ruled it unconstitutional.\n\nIt wasn't until 1913, when Democrats and progressive Republicans came together to pass the 16th Amendment, that the constitutional objections to direct federal taxation were cleared away and the modern system began to take shape.\n\nThe tax rates started small \u2013 the top rate was 7 percent \u2013 but the costs of World War I quickly pushed it to 77 percent. Ever since, the top rate has followed a predictable pattern: high in times of major wars and the Great Depression, low (or at least falling) the rest of the time. (See chart.)\n\nStory Hinckley and Laurent Belsie/Staff\n\nSomething else has changed, too. The federal government has become extremely reliant on the income tax on individuals, which has accounted for nearly half of its revenue since World War II.\n\nFederal income taxes have almost always been progressive: the rich pay a higher rate than the poor or the middle class. But the top tax rate tells only part of that story. It only applies to income over and above certain thresholds. Loopholes and exemptions and the interplay between corporate and individual income taxes make it even less likely that the rich pay that rate.\n\nIn 2014, Americans earning more than $250,000 paid an average 25.7 percent, according to the Pew Research Center, even though the official rate for those earners was anywhere from 33 percent to 39.6 percent.\n\nIs the system fair? That question has riled American politics since the federal income tax came into being. In 2014, the rich (the $250,000-plus set) paid just over half of all federal individual income taxes, according to Pew, while those making less than $50,000 paid only 5.7 percent.\n\nAs evidence mounts that the very rich have reaped almost all the nation's economic gains since the Great Recession, reformers are pushing to impose a higher income tax rate on the rich. Others are eager to change the tax code (including the one on corporate taxes) so there are fewer loopholes. Still others want a higher estate tax so that income inequality isn't passed down from generation to generation.\n\nProspects for tax reform look dim, however, unless November's election shifts the balance of power decisively to one party or the other.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE CANDIDATES: Where they stand on inequality issues\n\nWe encourage you to contact the Monitor on Twitter @csm_politics or by email csmpolitics@csps.com if you can improve our chart!\n\nStory Hinckley/Staff\n\nSources: the Jill Stein campaign, the Clinton campaign website, the Trump campaign website, ProCon.org, the Stein campaign website, iSideWith.com, The Fiscal Times, On the Issues, The Hill, CNN Money, The Washington Post\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nINTERVIEW: J.D.

But much of the generation that you write about in your book has taken a different path. Talk about that.\n\nMy grandparents and members of their generation were very willing to move for opportunity, but data today tell us that we\u2019re much less mobile now than we were 20 or 30 years ago. Part of it is definitely a reluctance to move to new opportunities. But it\u2019s a story complicated by the fact that moving isn\u2019t always a great thing, especially for those left behind when the brain drain sends the talent to Atlanta or Denver and those who are left are people really struggling to get by\u2026.\n\nHopefully, the lesson from 2016, when the dust clears, is a recognition that our politics can\u2019t continue as usual, because if it does these problems only get worse.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nENGAGE: Living Room Conversations and AllSides.com\n\nDiscuss: Join a civil conversation\n\nHave a Living Room Conversation about the opportunity gap with half a dozen friends who have diverse opinions.

It\u2019s hard to even seen them on the chart. But the top 1 percent has more of the country\u2019s wealth than 9 out of 10 Americans believe the entire top 20 percent should have. Mind-blowing.\n\n2. \"Debate: Is There Too Much Inequality in America?\" From Learn Liberty, a project of the the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University\n\nOne of the most important questions for me is: How easy is it, or how difficult is it, for folks who start off poor, to no longer be poor after five years or 10 years or 15 years?\n\n3. \"Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,\" by Charles Murray\n\n\u2018The more opulent citizens take great care not to stand aloof from the people,\u2019 wrote Alexis de Tocqueville, the great chronicler of American democracy, in the 1830s. \u2018On the contrary, they constantly keep on easy terms with the lower classes: They listen to them, they speak to them every day.\u2019 Americans love to see themselves this way. But there's a problem: It's not true anymore, and it has been progressively less true since the 1960s.... that problem is more pervasive than either political or economic inequality. What we now face is a problem of cultural inequality.\n\n4. \u201cIn climbing income ladder, location matters,\u201d New York Times interactive graphics based on study by Harvard's Economic Opportunity Project\n\nThe study \u2014 based on millions of anonymous earnings records and being released this week by a team of top academic economists \u2014 is the first with enough data to compare upward mobility across metropolitan areas.

But if she waited any longer, the landlord would summon the sheriff, who would arrive with a gun, a team of boot-footed movers, and a folder judge\u2019s order saying that her house was no longer hers. She would be given two options: truck or curb. 'Truck' would mean that her things would be loaded into an eighteen-footer and later checked into bonded storage. She could get everything back after paying $350. Arleen didn\u2019t have $350, so she would have opted for 'curb,' which would mean watching the movers pile everything onto the sidewalk. Her mattresses. A floor-model television. Her copy of 'Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Discipline.' Her nice glass dining table and the lace tablecloth that fit just-so. Silk plants. Bibles.

Lots of pundits are comparing it to Mitt Romney\u2019s famous \u201c47 percent\u201d statement, in which he said nearly half of American voters can be written off as welfare moochers.\n\nLost in most of the discussion of this comparison is the fact that Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d words, revealed when a secret source leaked the tape of a fundraiser to Mother Jones magazine, didn\u2019t much affect the 2012 outcome, and probably did not even move the polls that much.\n\nThat\u2019s the political reality behind such moments as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d or Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d: Voters usually don\u2019t make up their minds from a few days of news coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many voters saw Romney\u2019s perceived gaffe in negative terms. And it sure seemed like something that would have serious negative repercussions: harsh words, seemingly delivered in secret, about an opponent\u2019s supporters. That made it seem more important than a typical political slip of the tongue.\n\nBut in terms of who people planned to vote for, \u201cthere was no consistent evidence that much changed\u201d in the wake of the tape\u2019s release, wrote political scientists John Sides of George Washington University and Lynn Vavreck of UCLA in their history of the 2012 election, \u201cThe Gamble.\u201d\n\nGallup poll data showed President Obama\u2019s lead over Romney actually shrank from 3 to 2 percentage points the week after \u201c47 percent\u201d became public. Rasmussen polls stayed the same. The average of all public polls was \u201cstable\u201d in the wake of the controversy, according to Sides and Vavreck.\n\nIn other words, peoples\u2019 opinions about the race did not really alter, on either side.\n\nIn contrast, the first 2012 debate, held on Oct. 3, did move the polls. The media roundly declared Romney the victor over a flat Obama. Some surveys even put Romney in the lead. (Spoiler alert: He lost. The fallout of subsequent debates reversed those gains.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the takeaway from this? Maybe that lots of things the media says are game-changers, aren\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d comment could hurt her.

Trump on Monday brushed aside any speculation that Clinton might be replaced as the Democratic nominee, but said of the candidate\u2019s health: \u201cI think it\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, continued to criticize Clinton for saying \u2013 before her health episode \u2013 that half his supporters fall into a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d Clinton has expressed regret for the remarks, but Trump said, \u201cI think this is the biggest mistake of the political season.\u201d\n\nEven before Monday\u2019s comments, Trump already had said both candidates should release detailed medical records.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign earlier released a July 2015 letter from Dr. Lisa Bardack describing Clinton as \u201ca healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies.\u201d The letter noted her elbow fracture in 2009 and concussion in 2012. Bardack detailed how Clinton, now 68, had to undergo \u201canticoagulation therapy\u201d to dissolve a clot, and experienced \u201cdouble vision for a period of time,\u201d after the concussion.\n\nBut the campaign has not released detailed records beyond that.\n\nFormer President Obama adviser David Axelrod rapped Clinton Monday on her \"penchant for privacy.\"\n\nAntibiotics can take care of pneumonia. What's the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems? \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) September 12, 2016\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill provided an update Monday morning, saying Clinton \u201ccontinues to feel better, but intends to remain at home today, following her doctor's recommendation to rest.\u201d He said she would \u201cphone in briefly\u201d to an event in San Francisco proceeding in her absence.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News has learned that several top Clinton advisers \u2013 including communications director Jennifer Palmieri, campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook \u2013 have been sick with a bug in recent weeks, with one making a trip to the hospital.\n\nHowever, a senior aide to Clinton pushed back on a report that it\u2019s related to Clinton\u2019s illness.\n\n\"There is a bug that's been going around the office, no indication it's related to her being sick,\" the aide said.\n\nAn air of mystery surrounded the incident on Sunday. After Clinton left the ceremony, reporters following her on the campaign trail were prevented from leaving the media area for a period of time.\n\nClinton emerged from Chelsea Clinton's apartment just before noon and said she was \"feeling great.\"\n\n\"It's a beautiful day in New York,\" Clinton yelled to press waiting across the street.\n\n\"I am glad to learn that Secretary Clinton is already feeling better and I wish her a speedy recovery,\" said DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile in a statement. \"I look forward to seeing her back out on the campaign trail and continuing on the path to victory.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffin and John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/09/12/0/0/694940094001_5120918419001_091216-ff-trump-1280.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Clinton, Trump to release medical details after Hillary episode at 9/11 ceremony", "summary": "Her doctor also said the candidate had become \u201coverheated and dehydrated\u201d at Sunday\u2019s ceremony, but is \u201crecovering nicely.\u201dThe incident fueled questions about Clinton\u2019s health.\nTrump told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d earlier Monday morning that he\u2019ll be releasing \u201cvery, very specific\u201d details from a recent physical.\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump both are planning to release additional personal health information, after Clinton experienced a medical episode Sunday that forced her to leave a 9/11 anniversary ceremony early -- and after Trump said Monday morning that candidate health is now an \u201cissue\u201d in this campaign.\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon said on MSNBC that the campaign will release more information in the next couple days.\nAfter Clinton left the ceremony, reporters following her on the campaign trail were prevented from leaving the media area for a period of time.", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["ceremony", "episode", "trump", "campaign", "medical", "fox", "clintons", "morning", "hillary", "health", "details", "release", "clinton", "911", "think"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-09-10 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/10/politics/9-11-politics-trump-clinton-obama-bush/index.html", "text": "(CNN) The days following the September 11, 2001, attacks were marked by political solidarity over confronting America's enemies. No longer.\n\nAs the 15th anniversary of the horrific attacks approaches Sunday, the political world is bitterly divided on how to address terrorism and national security.\n\nDonald Trump dominated the GOP primaries after breaking with key elements of his party's post-9/11 ethos. He blamed former President George W. Bush, whose original response to the attacks sent his approval ratings to historic highs, for the terrorist strike. And Trump has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States. Though he's softened the proposal somewhat in gearing up for the general election, his stance still represents a dramatic departure from Bush's visit to the Islamic Center of Washington, DC, six days after the attacks to proclaim \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nToday's political climate is a far cry from the days when Hillary Clinton, a freshman senator from New York, and then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani came together to console grieving New Yorkers in the days after 9/11. Now Giuliani is one of Trump's top supporters, who repeatedly trashes Clinton.\n\nFor her part, Clinton, now the Democratic nominee, is still reckoning with decisions she made in the charged climate after the attacks, facing questions this week about her 2002 vote in favor of authorizing the Iraq War.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are more likely than five years ago to feel fear and anger when they think about what happened on September 11, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Friday.\n\nEven talking about terrorism in the current atmosphere can spark political controversy, with the nation's leaders squabbling over whether to label the threat \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nThe current commander in chief regularly faces media and political blowback in his attempts to argue that though terrorism is perilous, it does not represent an existential threat to the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, Guantanamo Bay -- opened in the aftermath of September 11 to house foreign enemy combatants -- is still open, as President Barack Obama's vows to close it have been stymied by Congress.\n\nClinton and Trump spent the last few days feuding over the Iraq War --with both trying to outdo the other in their stated opposition to it.\n\nClinton voted for the war but now admits it was a mistake, while Trump says he was always against it even though he was on record backing it at the time. In both cases, the sea change shows the unraveling of unified public opinion on how to prosecute the war on terror.\n\nAnd the fact that these issues remain such a core part of American political life as the nation pauses to observe the 15th anniversary of 9/11 reflects the enduring potential of terrorism to dominate the political conversation -- and explains why it is seen as such a potent tool by America's enemies.\n\nWith Syria in tatters, yet another new administration in Washington risks getting pulled into the morass of violence in the Middle East, a region US policies helped to splinter.\n\nJudging by the plans so far unveiled by Clinton and Trump -- longer on tough talk than detailed new strategies -- of how to swiftly crush ISIS, terrorism is likely to be reverberating through US politics for years to come. And recent ISIS attacks have only heightened its impact on the current political environment.\n\nPhotos: Timeline of the September 11 attacks Photos: Timeline of the September 11 attacks Thick smoke rises over the New York City skyline after the World Trade Center towers were downed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.

Hide Caption 31 of 31\n\nTrump's decision to base his campaign around a vision of a nation under siege from foreign extremism may have contributed to the mood.\n\n\"It has made the 15th anniversary more charged than some of the recent ones,\" said Matthew Dallek, a George Washington University professor who has published a new book about the origins of Homeland Security in the 1940s.\n\n\"His message is we are losing this war, we are incredibly vulnerable, we are being overrun by Syrian terrorists,\" Dallek said. \"He has contributed to that. A lot of people feel that.\"\n\nTrump, seeking to undercut Clinton's claim that her experience as secretary of state uniquely equips her for the presidency, accuses his rival of botching a chance to make America safer.\n\n\"She refused to take accountability for failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed horror of radical Islamic terrorism all over, and made us less safe than ever before,\" Trump said of his rival in Ohio on Thursday.\n\nClinton is effectively accusing Trump of being ISIS' candidate over his calls for a ban on Muslim immigration and promises to reinstate waterboarding for terror suspects.\n\n\"They are saying, 'Please Allah, make Trump president of America,' \"\n\nClinton said this week on Israeli television, arguing that her opponent's positions alienate Muslims to the benefit of ISIS.\n\n\"I'm not interested in giving aid and comfort to their evil ambitions,\" she said. \"I want to defeat them. I want to end their reign of terror.\"\n\nWhichever one wins the election will find out that the bitter politics of terrorism are often a distraction from the primary presidential function of keeping America safe.\n\nIn fact, despite fierce political differences between Bush and Obama and the hot rhetoric of the current campaign, there has been continuity in how America has fought the war on terrorism in the years since 9/11.\n\nObama streamlined his predecessor's approach and increased the lethality and frequency of drone strikes after taking office and can claim credit for having crushed the core leadership of al Qaeda. There is also broad agreement across the political spectrum on measures to protect the homeland and even for National Security Agency surveillance programs started under Bush and modified by Obama.\n\nIt is likely that for all the political back-and-forth in the campaign, a President Trump or a President Clinton would choose to keep many of the current administration's approaches in place.\n\nThe next president will have to deal with the long-term consequences of both Bush's decision to invade Iraq and Obama's decision to pull all US troops out. America's longest war, in Afghanistan, is still raging. ISIS is attracting adherents around the globe, while a host of other terrorist groups arm themselves.\n\nGiven public antipathy to sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Syria and Iraq, plans by Clinton and Trump to fight ISIS stress intensified air strikes, increased intelligence resources and an ideological challenge to the Islamic extremists. They also, however, mirror strategies Obama is already pursuing and don't seem likely to end the war quickly.\n\nThat's why Scott Mann, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former Green Beret and Special Forces operative who conducted pioneering counterterrorism and counterinsurgency programs while serving combat tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and South America, said the next president must transform the politics of the fight against terrorism by steeling Americans for a fight that could last many more years.\n\nHe warns that launching air strikes and taking terror leaders off the battlefield may be effective in the short term but do not treat the underlying cause of terrorism.\n\nInstead, Mann said, the US should send in troops to partner with clans and tribes in areas occupied by extremists in places like Syria and Iraq to empower local people to crush radicalism from the bottom up.\n\nMann's son was 3 when 9/11 happened; now he's in the military himself.\n\n\"There is no end in sight,\" Mann said. \"He is now on his path to become an Army lieutenant. That is quite a span of war -- for your kid to go to fight the war you didn't finish.\"", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150424105122-sot-george-w-bush-911-fdny-bullhorn-i-can-hear-you-00000523-super-169.jpg", "title": "Where 9/11 once united, it now divides", "summary": "Hide Caption 11 of 31 Photos: Timeline of the September 11 attacks Firefighters try to control the flames at the Pentagon.\nTwo of the planes were intentionally crashed into the two World Trade Center towers.\nIt was the first plane that hit the World Trade Center.\nHide Caption 3 of 31 Photos: Timeline of the September 11 attacks Fire and smoke are seen from the north tower.\nHide Caption 24 of 31 Photos: Timeline of the September 11 attacks People in New York navigate through a dust cloud.", "source": "CNN", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "keywords": ["11", "united", "hide", "center", "photos", "attacks", "timeline", "31", "trade", "caption", "world", "911", "divides"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-09-10 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/10/clinton-says-half-all-trump-supporters-deplorables.html", "text": "Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence followed running-mate Donald Trump on Saturday in denounced Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton for calling their supporters \u201cdeplorables,\u201d saying they are \u201cAmericans, and they deserve your respect.\u201d\n\nClinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a New York fundraiser Friday night that half of Trump-Pence supporters could be put into a \"basket of deplorables.\"\n\n\u201cRacist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere are people like that and he has lifted them up.\u201d\n\nClinton attempted at the fundraiser to qualify her remarks by saying they were \"grossly general-istic\" and that the other 50 percent of Trump supporters are frustrated by hard times and merit sympathy.\n\nHowever, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, then Pence seized on her remarks throughout the day.\n\n\u201cThe men and women who support Donald Trump's campaign are hard-working Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country,\u201d Pence said at the annual gathering of conservatives in Washington, D.C., known as the Value Voters Summit.\n\n\u201cThey are not a basket of anything, they are Americans, and they deserve your respect. \u2026 No one with that low opinion of the American people should ever be elected president of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nOne day after promising to be aspirational & uplifting, Hillary insults millions of Americans. #desperate https://t.co/OrBkowI4Sd \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) September 10, 2016\n\nEarlier in the day Trump tweeted: \u201cWow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard-working people\u201d tweeted Trump, after Clinton\u2019s comments at a Friday night New York fundraiser. \u201cI think it will cost her at the Polls!\u201d\n\n(1/3) She gave an entire speech about how the alt right movement is using his campaign to advance its hate movement. https://t.co/ZZZv31cFCq \u2014 Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) September 10, 2016\n\nClinton was speaking at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City, where she encouraged supporters to \"stage an intervention\" if they have friends considering voting for Trump.\n\n\"That may be one conversion therapy I'd endorse,\" said Clinton, referring to a type of counseling designed to urge gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender children to change their sexual orientation.

For the past two decades, Washington has been struggling in vain to stop North Korea\u2019s aggressive, anti-American leaders from arming the country with nuclear weapons.\n\nAlthough it was long thought that North Korean nuclear and missile tests were intended as muscle flexing for both internal and external consumption, and as a way to exact concessions from the great powers, a growing number of experts and officials say that the North may be committed to assembling a nuclear arsenal that would include smaller weapons that could be mounted on short-range missiles.\n\nMs. Park said later on Friday that the latest test proved a \u201cfanatical recklessness of the Kim Jong-un regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing the Kim Jong-un regime will get from this nuclear test will be more intensified sanctions from the international community and deeper isolation,\u201d Ms. Park said. \u201cThis kind of provocation will only quicken its eventual self-destruction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said that if a test had been conducted, \u201cit simply cannot be justified.\u201d He added that he had instructed government security analysts to collect as much information as possible and share it with the United States, South Korea, China and Russia.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Beijing \u201cexpresses strong opposition\u201d to the test. \u201cIt is the firm stance of China to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, prevent nuclear proliferation, and safeguard the peace and stability of Northeast Asia,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe foreign minister said China urged North Korea to \u201cstop escalating\u201d its actions and to abide by United Nations resolutions that forbid nuclear tests.\n\nThough Beijing\u2019s relations have been strained over Pyongyang\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, has refrained from severely punishing Mr. Kim.\n\nThe Obama administration has pointed to North Korea as one of the issues where China and the United States could work together, and praised China for supporting United Nations sanctions imposed this year against North Korea.\n\nBut reports from the border region with North Korea show that Chinese trade continues, and Washington and Beijing increasingly differ on how to deal with the North\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nWhen South Korea agreed in July to the American request to deploy an antimissile system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, as protection against North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons, China strongly protested and even suggested that the deployment was as provocative as the North Korean tests.\n\nAt the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi in Hangzhou, China, last week, the Chinese leader reiterated his opposition to the deployment of the Thaad system, asking the United States to respect China\u2019s strategic interests.\n\nVideo\n\nOne of China\u2019s biggest fears is a collapse of North Korea that would result in a unified Korean Peninsula under an American defense treaty. For that reason, Chinese analysts say, China has tolerated Mr. Kim\u2019s advances in nuclear weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea last tested a nuclear device on Jan. 6. In April, Ms. Park warned that the North might be preparing for another underground nuclear test in defiance of United Nations sanctions.\n\nSuspicions that Pyongyang had set off another nuclear device arose quickly on Friday after a tremor was reported near where previous tests have been carried out; actual earthquakes are rare on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe North Korean statement was read by Ri Chun-hee, 73, on Central Television, the state-run broadcaster. Ms. Ri, known to the outside world for her soaring, bombastic voice, has been assigned to read all the North\u2019s most important announcements, including the death of Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011. South Korean monitors brace themselves whenever Ms. Ri, typically clad in a pink traditional Korean dress, appears on TV and opens what they call her \u201ccannon mouth.\u201d\n\nFriday will be the 68th anniversary of the founding of the North Korean government. The country often celebrates its major holidays with displays of military might. Last week, it fired three ballistic missiles into the sea between the North and Japan, prompting the United Nations Security Council to urge the North to stop provocations or face more sanctions.\n\nIn March, the North Korean state news media reported that Mr. Kim had ordered that a \u201cnuclear warhead explosion test\u201d be conducted soon, as well as tests of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads. North Korea has since launched a series of ballistic missiles, including one fired from a submarine last month.\n\nToday\u2019s Headlines: Asia Edition Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.

But the North has continued to flaunt its nuclear ambitions with a series of tests and claims about what it says are its growing technological capabilities.\n\nSince inheriting power from his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has called for accelerating the North\u2019s pursuit of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons in defiance of international pressure. Three of the North\u2019s five nuclear tests have been conducted under his rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has indicated that it is now capable of building a warhead compact and sophisticated enough to mount on an intercontinental ballistic missile. But such claims have been difficult to verify.\n\nNorth Korea has never flight-tested a long-range missile, and officials and analysts in the region generally doubt that it has built a reliable ICBM. But the leaders of two government-run research institutes in Seoul have recently said that they believed North Korea was now able to mount a nuclear warhead on a short-range Scud or medium-range Rodong missile, if not on an ICBM.\n\nPyongyang said its Jan. 6 nuclear test was of a hydrogen bomb, which would have been a major escalation in its capacity for destruction.\n\nYet analysts were skeptical of the claim, saying that such a weapon would have generated a much bigger seismic wave. Some experts said the North might have tried to bolster the yield of a more basic device by using tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/10/world/10Korea-2/10Korea-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "North Korea Tests a Mightier Nuclear Bomb, Raising Tension", "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyOn Friday, North Korea reported a major advance in its efforts.\nNorth Korea has since launched a series of ballistic missiles, including one fired from a submarine last month.\nNorth Korea has never flight-tested a long-range missile, and officials and analysts in the region generally doubt that it has built a reliable ICBM.\nPyongyang said its Jan. 6 nuclear test was of a hydrogen bomb, which would have been a major escalation in its capacity for destruction.\nIn Washington, Ned Price, a National Security Council spokesman, said: \u201cWe are aware of seismic activity on the Korean Peninsula in the vicinity of a known North Korean nuclear test site.", "source": "New York Times", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Jane Perlez", "Choe Sang-hun"], "keywords": ["tension", "tests", "korea", "north", "norths", "nuclear", "united", "mightier", "china", "kim", "test", "bomb", "korean", "sea", "raising"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-09-07 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-calls-for-defense-sequester-to-end/2016/09/07/7dda8548-7513-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_forum-11pm%3Ahomepage/story", "text": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump answered questions on national security and foreign policy Sept. 7 during a \u201ccommander-in-chief forum\u201d on NBC News.

(Video: NBC News/Photos: Melina Mara/Post, Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nDonald Trump defended his admiration for Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin at a forum here Wednesday focused on national security issues, even suggesting that Putin is more worthy of his praise than President Obama.\n\n\u201cCertainly, in that system, he\u2019s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a divided country.\u201d\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee said that an alliance with Russia would help defeat the Islamic State, and when asked to defend some of Putin\u2019s aggressions on the world stage, he asked, \u201cDo you want me to start naming some of the things Obama does at the same time?\u201d\n\nTrump also said he appreciated some of the kind words Putin has had for him. \u201cWell, I think when he calls me brilliant, I think I\u2019ll take the compliment, okay?\u201d\n\nTrump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton made back-to-back appearances at an event that sounded the starting gun for the final stretch of the presidential race and offered a potential preview of what are expected to be rollicking debates in the weeks to come.\n\nOn Sept. 7, during a town hall event hosted by MSNBC, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated he would have \u201ca good relationship\u201d with Russian president Vladimir Putin. It wasn\u2019t the first time he made that claim. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)\n\nClinton offered herself as a model of \u201cabsolute rock steadiness\u201d on foreign policy, and Trump promised to be a disruptive force for improvement, saying that under Obama even the military\u2019s generals have been \u201creduced to rubble.\u201d Trump suggested he could replace some of the military brass.\n\nClinton appeared guarded, even stilted, as she navigated tough questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her vote for the Iraq war in the Senate, but Trump showed no such restraint with a series of controversial statements.\n\nHe reaffirmed his view that having men and women serve alongside one another is the root of the military\u2019s sexual-assault problem. He said recent intelligence briefings have convinced him that Clinton and other Obama administration officials did not heed the advice of experts. And he praised Putin, noting among other things the Russian president\u2019s \u201c82 percent approval rating.\u201d\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s forum, Trump delivered a speech in Philadelphia in which he called for a robust expansion of U.S. military capabilities and an end to budget sequestration on defense spending.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military. It is so depleted. We will rebuild our military,\u201d Trump said during the speech at the Union League of Philadelphia. \u201cThis will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s address represented his most substantive and comprehensive plan on national security to date \u2014 part of an ongoing effort to assuage doubts that he lacks a sufficient understanding of policy issues to assume the presidency. Reading from prepared remarks, Trump spoke about modernizing the \u00admilitary\u2019s equipment and increasing the size of the armed forces.\n\nClinton, who has also advocated ending the defense sequester, spent the earlier part of her segment of the forum defending herself regarding the email controversy and her handling of classified material, which she insisted she did responsibly.\n\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail View Photos The GOP presidential nominee is out on the trail ahead of the general election in November.

But Clinton said she had learned from the decision and chided Trump for saying he had opposed the war from the outset despite statements to the contrary.\n\n\u201cI have taken responsibility for my decision,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe refuses to take responsible for his support.\u201d\n\nThe forum, broadcast by MSNBC and NBC stations and hosted by Matt Lauer of the \u201cToday\u201d show, was billed as a discussion of the most important issues facing the nation\u2019s next commander in chief. Clinton and Trump appeared separately before a live audience of active-duty military personnel and veterans \u2014 a group that traditionally skews Republican \u2014 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. The event was hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n\nThe forum was scheduled ahead of three standard debates between the two major-party presidential nominees, the first of which is scheduled for Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.\n\nClinton and Trump were asked early in their segments not to attack each other \u2014 and both drew admonishments from Lauer for ignoring his request.\n\nClinton, for example, chided Trump for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country, saying, \u201cThat is not going to help us succeed in defeating ISIS.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump accused Clinton of having a \u201chappy trigger,\u201d a suggestion that she is too eager to insert the United States into international conflicts.\n\nThe United States\u2019s involvement in Iraq was a prominent part of both segments.\n\nClinton argued that the war was one area where she and Trump shared positions. \u201cI think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake, and I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere was a mistake. My opponent was for the war in Iraq. He says he wasn\u2019t; you can go back and look at the record. He supported it.\u201d\n\nClinton vowed that, if she is elected president, \u201cwe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.\u201d\n\nAs he has in the past, Trump insisted that he did not support President Bush\u2019s invasion in 2003, despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe businessman also argued that taking Iraq\u2019s oil would have prevented the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said, shouldn\u2019t be there, but if we\u2019re going to get out, take the oil,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we would have taken the oil, you wouldn\u2019t have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil. \u201c\n\nDuring his segment, Trump also defended a Twitter message he posted three years ago that stated the estimated number of unreported sexual assaults in the military and then mused: \u201cWhat did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is, it is a correct tweet,\u201d Trump said when asked about the tweet by Lauer. \u201cThere are many people that think that that\u2019s absolutely correct. . . . Well, well, it\u2019s happening, right? And, by the way, since then, it\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what he had learned from his intelligence briefings since becoming the Republican nominee, Trump said that Obama and others have not done \u201cwhat our experts said to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was very, very surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cIn almost every instance, and I could tell, I\u2019m pretty good with the body language. I could tell, they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.\u201d\n\nTrump said he was not a fan of the Russian system of government but predicted continued good relations with Putin, saying: \u201cI think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin, and I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.\u201d\n\nTrump denied that mutual admiration between him and the Russian leader would benefit Russia in its dealings with the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get him anything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m a negotiator.\u201d\n\nDuring her segment, Clinton defended her handling of classified information, insisting that she never sent or received any documents on her private email server that were properly marked as classified.\n\nClinton was pressed with questions on the issue almost as soon as the forum began.\n\n\u201cClassified material has a header that says \u2018top secret,\u2019 \u2018secret,\u2019 \u2018confidential,\u2019 \u201d Clinton said. \u201cNone of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.\u201d\n\nThe issue has bedeviled her campaign from the start, and one of the questions about it came from a veteran, who noted that if he had handled classified information in a way that was not permitted, he would have been prosecuted and jailed.\n\n\u201cI communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI took it very seriously.\u201d\n\nA poll released Wednesday showed Trump with a sizable lead among active-duty personnel and veterans.\n\nTrump leads Clinton by 19 points \u2014 55 percent to 36 percent \u2014 among voters who are serving or have served in the U.S. military, according to the NBC News/SurveyMonkey tracking poll.\n\nThat\u2019s a somewhat larger margin that two other recent national polls of military veterans since the Democratic convention. Trump led Clinton by 14 points in a Fox News poll and 11 points in a McClatchy-Marist poll.\n\nThe demographics of military veterans align closely with Trump\u2019s strongest sources of support. More than 9 in 10 are men, and about 8 in 10 are white. In 2012, among military veterans, Republican Mitt Romney bested Obama by about 20 points, according to exit polls.\n\nThe run-up to Wednesday\u2019s forum featured intense jockeying between Clinton and Trump over which candidate is better suited to lead the military \u2014 with each sharply questioning the other\u2019s temperament and judgment. During a campaign stop Tuesday in Tampa, Clinton said Trump had \u201cno clue\u201d about national security issues.\n\nJust minutes before the forum was to begin, Clinton tweeted, \u201cDonald Trump has proven over and over again that he\u2019s unfit to be our Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced that he has been endorsed by 88 retired senior military officials. Not to be outdone, Clinton released a list Wednesday showing the support of 95 retired generals and admirals, more than any recent nonincumbent Democrat, her campaign said. Meanwhile, Clinton noted that Trump\u2019s endorsement figure was more than 400 shy of the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.\n\nDelReal and Gearan reported from Washington.

Clinton\u2019s advantage in the RealClearPolitics polling average was down to 3.3 points, less than half of what it was at its peak.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor all that, however, the Democratic nominee remains the favorite to win the White House \u2014 in part because of her strength in the battleground states that will decide the election.\n\nClinton has succeeded in making some Republican redoubts competitive, including Georgia and Arizona. But the election will come down to the same states that have decided most recent presidential contests.\n\nThe Hill took a look at where things stand in those 11 states.\n\nOHIO\n\nTrump can take heart from the fact that he is performing stronger in Ohio than in many other battlegrounds.\n\nA Washington Post/SurveyMonkey poll of all 50 states published Tuesday showed the GOP nominee with a 3-point lead in the state. Another recent poll, from Emerson College, had the race tied. As of Tuesday afternoon, however, Clinton still held a 3.3-point lead in the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nThe demographics go some way toward explaining the tightness of the race. Only 3 percent of Ohio voters in 2012 were Latino, according to exit polls. The proportion of voters who were college graduates was just 40 percent, the lowest figure among the 11 battleground states highlighted here.\n\nThat should make Ohio fertile ground for Trump\u2019s core appeal to blue-collar whites.\n\nStill, the Clinton campaign is leaning on traditional tactics to win the state. Her campaign had 36 field offices there to Trump\u2019s 16 at the end of August, according to a recent \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d analysis. On TV, Clinton and her allies are outspending their Republican counterparts by a huge amount. They have booked around $22 million of broadcast TV ads between now and November, compared with less than $2 million for Trump and his backers, Ad Age reported after examining data from Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nFLORIDA\n\nFlorida is the biggest single prize among the battlegrounds, with 29 electoral votes. Of the four most recent major polls of the state, Clinton and Trump each led two. No result showed an advantage of more than 2 percentage points for either candidate.\n\nFlorida is also one of the most expensive states in which to compete. Clinton and her allies have booked almost $34 million in ads there, according to Ad Age and Kantar Media.\n\nThe outlook is more optimistic for Trump than many observers expected, given that 17 percent of Florida voters in 2012 were Latino and the traditional loyalty of Cuban-Americans to the GOP has been weakening.\n\nBut could Trump\u2019s skeletal campaign cost him? He had only one field office in the state in late August, compared with 34 for Clinton, according to the PBS figures.\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nOne of Clinton\u2019s strongest states among the battlegrounds, Virginia is Exhibit A in how the electoral map is changing.\n\nThe commonwealth was a Republican stronghold until 2008, when President Obama became the first Democrat to carry it since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But forecasting site FiveThirtyEight now gives Clinton a greater than 80 percent chance of repeating Obama\u2019s feat. She is 5 points ahead in the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nAnother telling fact: Neither Clinton nor Trump have major broadcast advertising planned for the state, according to Ad Age.\n\nTwenty percent of Virginia voters were black in 2012 \u2014 a group that polls show has little support for Trump. Another group largely uninterested in Trump \u2014 college graduates \u2014 cast 54 percent of the votes there in 2012, the highest figure in any of these 11 states.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nIn another example of the changing nature of the South, Clinton seems to have a slight edge in North Carolina. The mere fact that she is competitive says a lot: Obama became the first Democrat in three decades to carry the state in 2008, and he lost there in 2012.\n\nRight now, Clinton has a very small lead in the RealClearPolitics average. But she has 30 field offices in the state, while Trump is not known to have any. She and her allies have booked $16 million in ads there, to just $1 million for Trump.\n\nJust as vitally for Clinton, African-Americans cast a bigger share of the total votes there in 2012 \u2014 23 percent \u2014 than in any other battleground.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nThe Trump campaign has long talked up its chances of prevailing in Pennsylvania, but so far, that looks unlikely. Clinton has a lead of more than 6 points in the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nRepublicans have consistently sought to flip Pennsylvania, but they have come up short in every election since 1988.\n\nOf the total votes cast in 2012, around 20 percent came from nonwhites. Republicans fear Trump could also struggle with moderates in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nClinton and related groups have more than $18 million in ads booked in the state between now and the election, according to Ad Age, compared with just over $1 million for Trump.\n\nCOLORADO\n\nClinton\u2019s advantage in Colorado is emblematic of the fears some Republicans have about the party\u2019s future in an increasingly diverse America.\n\nShe leads by more than 11 points in the RealClearPolitics average, and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s \u201cpolls only\u201d forecast gives her an almost 75 percent chance of carrying the state.\n\nTwo figures go part of the way to explaining Clinton\u2019s strength: Latinos accounted for 14 percent of the state\u2019s voters in 2012\u2019s elections, and 49 percent of Colorado voters were college graduates. Both those numbers are higher than the average, and Trump performs poorly with both groups.\n\nWISCONSIN\n\nWinning Wisconsin would seem to be a big stretch for Trump: A Republican has not carried the state since President Ronald Reagan did in his 1984 reelection landslide. But, relatively speaking, Trump is performing well there. He is within 2 points of Clinton in the most recent Washington Post poll. Two other recent polls have pegged her advantage at 3 points and 5 points. One factor that could be aiding Trump: 86 percent of voters in Wisconsin were white in 2012. The proportion with a college degree was also toward the lower end among battleground states, at 42 percent.\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nMichigan is, so far, proving that Trump\u2019s Rust Belt strategy has its limits. Clinton is more than 7 points ahead there, according to the RealClearPolitics average, while FiveThirtyEight pegs her chances of a win at around 75 percent. There is some hope for Trump \u2014 Clinton leads by only 2 points in a Washington Post poll. Trump and his allies are spending a modest sum in TV advertising in the state.

Clinton\u2019s lead is only 2.3 points in the RealClearPolitics average. It\u2019s worth noting that Nevada is the only state where Trump is at parity with Clinton in terms of field offices \u2014 they have six apiece, according to the PBS analysis.\n\nIOWA\n\nIowa was the only battleground state where Trump held an advantage in the RealClearPolitics average as of Tuesday afternoon, albeit an edge of less than 1 percentage point. Ninety-three percent of the ballots cast there in 2012 were from whites. It\u2019s also a state that has traditionally been difficult territory for Clinton.

She is up 9 points in the RealClearPolitics average. The contrast with Iowa may be rooted in differing social attitudes, with even New Hampshire Republicans leaning more libertarian than their conservative counterparts in Iowa.

It is also testimony to the errors of Marxism, which maintained that workers would ultimately fight against and prevail over their capitalist bosses.\n\nFor today American labor unions are on the ropes, and the once-communist countries of eastern Europe and much of Asia are immersed in capitalist planning. Instead of working classes coming together on Labor Day, as Marxist strategists predicted, their counterparts (corporate workers, small business employees, self-employed consultants, professional people in general or what Marxism would dub the bourgeoisie) are coming together throughout the world. And not just today, but on any given day of the year. Even on this holiday many will be in hotel rooms or airplanes preparing for meetings in countries that don\u2019t honor the first Monday in September as special.\n\nThese individuals don\u2019t consider themselves workers so much as they do professionals. They are formally educated as well as schooled in the nuances of their field. Their most frequent place of meeting is likely to be in airport lounges, at gates waiting to board or even in airplane seats. They exchange business cards as a minimum sort of rite-of-passage and sometimes follow up with an email, text or phone call.\n\nIn place of the raucous cries of blue-collar workers on strike or protest, their conversation is polite, rarely heated or finger-pointing, often punctuated by humor or small talk. Their reading materials are technical periodicals, their flags or ornaments of identification are briefcases and the latest models of mobile devices. These working people in and of the world rarely unite \u2014 as the proletariats in Marxist society were supposed to. They\u2019re strongly individualistic, hoping to get ahead of their colleagues, but their folkways belie any struggle, although the current National Labor Relations Board, dominated by Democratic appointees, is attempting desperately to define them in blue-collar terms so as to effect unionization.\n\nTo be sure, these individuals appear to be getting ready for battle. At hotels from Portland, Oregon to Hong Kong, they huff and puff in fitness rooms or by swimming laps and jogging. Their body armor is measured in abs. Increasingly, they shun alcohol, even in the first-class airplane seats where it is free. And they recognize as well that smoking is not only a health hazard but can be a definite impediment to their upward mobility.\n\nIf the proletariat of Marxism looked forward to a heavenly city of classlessness and more power, this new breed of world travelers has a much more limited vision, focused mostly on time and predictability. Namely, the hope is that airline schedules will be kept, meetings attended or negotiations begun and effected as scheduled.\n\nThese new workers of the world hope for a clean and quiet hotel room, a good night\u2019s sleep, pleasant receptionists, flight attendants, waiters and waitresses and cab drivers who not only know the shortest way to the airport but know when to converse and not to. Instead of criticizing the machine age that was the bane of the proletariat who feared it would hurt or replace them, they praise the mobile devices that have made their work and life instantaneous and seamless.\n\nAnd they are religious in a sense. As they plan to venture from one spot in the globe or nation to another, their prayers are silent and modest, namely, that nobody will be sitting next to them on the next day\u2019s flight.\n\n\u2022 Thomas V.

(Photo: Mark Schiefelbein, EPA)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 President Obama tried to downplay talk of an orchestrated diplomatic snub by China on Sunday as leaders from the G-20 major world economies began a summit in the east Chinese city of Hangzhou.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the opening ceremony on Sunday afternoon, Obama said people should not \u201cover-crank\u201d a series of heated altercations between U.S. and Chinese officials in the 24 hours since he arrived in the communist country.\n\n\"I think this time maybe ... the seams are showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes,\" he said. \"And, in fairness, when delegations travel to the United States, sometimes there are issues about our security procedures and protocols that they're aggravated with but don't always get reported on.\"\n\nTensions over protocol began almost as soon as Air Force One touched down in Hangzhou on Saturday. No mobile staircase was prepared for the U.S. president to exit the front door of the plane, forcing him to leave via the lower back door, which has its own stairs.\n\nHe also was the only national leader not to be provided with red carpet on arrival.\n\nObama said it was not the first time \u201cthings like this had happened,\u201d saying they have also occurred whilst visiting close allies.\n\n\"Part of it is we also have a much bigger footprint than a lot of other countries,\" he said. \"And we've got a lot of planes and a lot of helicopters and a lot of cars and a lot of guys, and if you're a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much.\"\n\nObama insisted that the tensions did not detract \"from the broader scope of the relationship. As we saw yesterday, President Xi and I continued what has been a historic joint project to elevate climate change issues. The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation. When I bring up issues like human rights, there are some tensions there that perhaps don't take place when President Xi meets with other leaders, but that's part of our job, that's part of what we do.\"\n\nThe comments came after Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping spent several hours on Saturday in wide-ranging bilateral talks, touching on the environment, the South China Sea, protectionism and human rights.\n\nThe two parties, the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitters, announced they would formally join the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\n\n\u201cWhere countries like China and the United States are prepared to show leadership and to lead by example, it is possible for us to create a world that is more secure, more prosperous, and more free than the one that was left for us,\u201d Obama said in announcing America's adoption of the agreement.\n\nYet despite this and other points of agreement, there was plenty of evidence of tension.\n\nChinese officials blocked U.S. travelling media from watching the president disembark, shouting \u201cthis is our country\u201d at a U.S. diplomat when she tried to argue this was not the norm for presidential arrivals.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan E. Rice and her deputy, Benjamin J. Rhode, were also blocked from approaching President Obama on the tarmac. Later she said the Chinese had done things that \u201cweren\u2019t anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe tussles continued as the Chinese reportedly cut American press access to the bilateral events. When Obama and Xi went for a walk along Hangzhou's famous West Lake in the evening, the press pack was reduced from six to one, the Washington Post reported.\n\nAt the same time as playing down the tensions, the president also defended media norms in the U.S. and other Western nations.\n\n\"We think it's important that the press have access to the work that we're doing, that they have the ability to answer questions,\" Obama told members of the media on Saturday. \" And we don't leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cq76ML", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dcf7a5e162ecaf424bb786a3bfcd0eb1be1097de/c=0-153-3000-1848&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/09/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636085647404770994-EPA-China-G20.jpg", "title": "Obama downplays alleged diplomatic snub by China", "summary": "National Security Advisor Susan E.

Earning a place in our community of scholars is no small achievement and we are delighted that you selected Chicago to continue your intellectual journey.\n\n\n\nOnce here you will discover that one of the University of Chicago\u2019s defining characteristics is our commitment to freedom of inquiry and expression. This is captured in the University\u2019s faculty report on freedom of expression. Members of our community are encouraged to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn, without fear of censorship. Civility and mutual respect are vital to all of us, and freedom of expression does not mean the freedom to harass or threaten others. You will find that we expect members of our community to be engaged in rigorous debate, discussion, and even disagreement. At times this may challenge you and even cause discomfort.\n\nEllison got specific about the trendy retreats from dissenting views in which the school won\u2019t engage, adding that diversity of ideas is part of the college\u2019s diversity strategy.\n\nOur commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support so called \u2018trigger warnings,\u2019 we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual \u2018safe spaces\u2019 where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.\n\n\n\nFostering the free exchange of ideas reinforces a related University priority\u2014 building a campus that welcomes people of all backgrounds.

So I emailed Ellison\u2019s office to confirm it.\n\n\n\n\u2018I can confirm that the letter is authentic,\u2019 a U of C spokesperson told Reason.\n\n\n\nBravo, Chicago.

Mrs. Clinton told investigators that she was unaware that the aide had deleted the emails.\n\nDozens of times during her interview, Mrs. Clinton said she did not remember details about the server or guidance she had received on how to handle classified information.\n\nIn its summary of the investigation, the F.B.I. said that Mrs. Clinton had emailed Colin Powell, a former secretary of state, a day after she was sworn in to office about Mr. Powell\u2019s use of a personal email account when he was the country\u2019s top diplomat. Mr. Powell warned Mrs. Clinton that if she used her BlackBerry for official business, those emails could become \u201cofficial record[s] and subject to the law.\u201d\n\nMr. Powell, apparently implying that he was cautious in his use of a personal email account, added: \u201cBe very careful.

In a statement, her campaign said it was pleased that the F.B.I. had made the documents public.\n\n\u201cWhile her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nBut Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that the deletion of the emails violated an order his committee issued to Mrs. Clinton in 2012 and a subpoena issued by the Benghazi committee in 2015.\n\nHe said he planned to seek answers from Mrs. Clinton about the deletions. \u201cThese were not Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 they were government records, and this was potentially one of the largest security breaches at the State Department because they had all these years of security records that just went out the door,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very black-and-white order.

Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the F.B.I. of withholding key documents \u2014 including many unclassified ones \u2014 from public view.\n\nThe selective release, he said, produced \u201can incomplete and possibly misleading picture of the facts without the other unclassified information that is still locked away from the public and even most congressional staff.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton told F.B.I. investigators that she had used a personal email server \u201cout of convenience\u201d and did not remember anyone raising legal concerns about the practice.\n\nShe also said that she \u201cdid not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,\u201d the F.B.I. documents say. \u201cShe relied on State officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address,\u201d they say.\n\nThe document summarizing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s interview, known in the F.B.I. as a 302 report, runs only a dozen pages. The memorandum on the investigation is lengthier, and goes into greater detail about aspects of the case. The materials were presumably provided to James B.

(The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump gave his long-awaited speech on immigration in Phoenix on Aug. 31. Here\u2019s a roundup of some of the more interesting claims he made in the lengthy address; we expect we will dig deeper into some of his other statistics in the coming days. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios in speech roundups.\n\n\u201cIllegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher.\u201d\n\nTrump states this $113 billion figure as an undisputed fact, but it comes from a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to dramatically reduce legal immigration. So you immediately have to look at the numbers with skepticism.\n\nDigging into the numbers, you see that burden on the federal budget is estimated to be just $29 billion, whereas $84 billion is supposedly borne by state and local governments. Why is that? The group counts the cost of educating the children of illegal immigrants, even if they are born in the United States and, thus, are U.S. citizens. \u201cThe birth of these children and their subsequent medical care represent a large share of the estimated Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Program expenditures associated with illegal aliens,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe report, however, says it tries to account for the taxes collected by federal and local governments from illegal immigrants, but the services used by undocumented immigrants outweigh revenue collections. (Taking into account tax revenues, FAIR says the net cost is about $99 billion.) We should note that because the federal government is currently running a deficit, U.S. citizens also receive more in government benefits than they pay in taxes.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\u201d\n\nTrump falsely says Clinton\u2019s plan will provide Social Security to illegal immigrants. We awarded this claim Four Pinocchios. In general, people in the United States illegally are not eligible to collect Social Security benefits. They must be granted some type of lawful status \u2014 either by obtaining legal status or being granted deferred action.\n\nEven those who are granted deferred action through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) are not granted benefits through the Affordable Care Act. They are, however, eligible for Social Security retirement and Medicare benefits with 10 years of work history, after paying income taxes, and once they reach retirement age.\n\nClinton supports \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d and has vowed that within her first 100 days in office, she will introduce a plan to overhaul the immigration system with a pathway to full citizenship (which Trump calls \u201camnesty\u201d). Clinton also supports President Obama\u2019s executive actions on DACA and DAPA. DAPA is pending in court under litigation, and DACA went into effect in 2012.\n\nClinton does support expanding Obamacare to all families, regardless of immigration status and allowing them to buy into the health exchanges, according to her immigration proposal.\n\nBut DACA grantees will not yet reach retirement age if Clinton becomes president and serves two terms in office. DACA grantees must have been under 31 as of June 15, 2012, and meet several other criteria to be eligible. So if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43.\n\nTrump says her plan would break the federal budget, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the immigration reform component of Clinton\u2019s plan would save the federal budget $100 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u201cThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.\u201d\n\nTrump has used this number before, but it stems from the unverified assumption that Clinton, who has called for 55,000 additional refugees from Syria, would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration\u2019s proposal for 100,000 refugees for fiscal year 2017. Trump then multiplies 155,000 times four years to reach 620,000 refugees. Clinton has never proposed such a \u201cplan,\u201d so this is an invented figure. Clinton only has proposed an increase of 55,000 refugees for one year.\n\n\u201cWe will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don\u2019t even know about.\u201d\n\nTrump lauded these two Department of Homeland Security programs, but both have been widely scrutinized and it\u2019s questionable how effective they are.\n\nDHS targeted immigration enforcement to those who committed serious crimes through efforts like Secure Communities, rolled out per county from 2008 through 2012. But a 2014 study showed that increased enforcement didn\u2019t lead to decreased crime, calling into question whether serious crimes were prevalent.\n\nSecure Communities was billed as a crackdown on immigrants who committed serious crimes. But researchers found Secure Communities did not result in a meaningful reduction in the FBI\u2019s overall index crime rate or in rates of violent crimes. There were modest reductions in burglary and motor vehicle theft, not serious crimes like homicides or violent crime.\n\nThe program is being phased out, as local agencies are ending or scaling back their participation. Secure Communities was meant to be a complement to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s 287(g) program, through which ICE gave authority to certain state and local law enforcement officers to carry out the functions of federal immigration agents.\n\nThe 287(g) program was scrutinized by immigration advocates for diverting local resources to do federal enforcement work, and the potential for racial profiling, without proper federal oversight.\n\nIn fact, local law enforcement officers carrying out immigration enforcement under 287(g) authority led to a federal racial profiling case against Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, a Trump surrogate who delivered one of the opening speeches Wednesday night. The Department of Justice found that the sheriff\u2019s office engaged in systemic racial profiling of Latinos. DHS removed the 287(g) authority of Arpaio\u2019s agency, and a federal judge imposed changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\u201d\n\nTrump says the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States \u2014 which is estimated at 11 million \u2014 could be anywhere between 3 million or 30 million. A number of independent organizations researching immigrant flows and the federal government have arrived at the 11 million estimate for the population of undocumented immigrants, using calculations of Census data.\n\nOur friends at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have found Trump\u2019s 30 million figure to be bogus. A range of experts who study this issue say the margin of error for the 11 million figure may be plus or minus 1 million, but no serious research supports Trump\u2019s claim it could be as high as 30 million.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in the last five years, we\u2019ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries, according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.\u201d\n\nActually, between 2009 and 2014, the United States has admitted 120,000 immigrants from Iraq and 18,000 from Afghanistan, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. So this is a rare case where Trump lowballs a number. (Oops! In our bleary-eyed state, we counted six years. From 2010 to 2014, the combined figure was about 108,000.)\n\nIt goes without saying that the United States has fought two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In fact, special visa programs were enacted by Congress to expedite the processing of Afghans and Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government.\n\nTrump correctly cites a Pew Research study that surveyed attitudes in various Muslim countries. \u201cIn only two countries \u2014 Afghanistan (60%) and Iraq (60%) \u2014 do majorities say honor killings of women are often or sometimes justified, while only in Afghanistan does a majority (59%) say the same about executing men who have allegedly engaged in pre- or extra-marital sex,\u201d the report said.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton \u201csupport visa overstays.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has a visa overstay identification process. According to DHS, there were nearly 45 million nonimmigrant visitors in fiscal 2015, with an overstay rate of 1.17 percent, or 525,127 people. That was the first time DHS provided an estimate of foreign visitors who overstayed.\n\nBut the Obama administration \u2014 and previously, the Bush administration \u2014 has been criticized by Congress, law enforcement officials and advocates for failing to fix loopholes in the visa program.\n\nClinton\u2019s immigration proposal does not address visa overstays. The only mention of visa issues in her proposal is to \u201cfix the family visa backlog,\u201d but it does not offer any specifics. According to the pro-immigrant group National Immigration Forum, there is an administrative backlog of processing visas for spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens. Clinton has said her \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d proposal with a pathway to citizenship would fix the family visa backlog.\n\n\u201cThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they\u2019ve been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won\u2019t take them back.\u201d\n\nTrump is right about this, according to a letter written by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who in June 2016 urged the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to stop granting visas to countries that refuse to accept the deportation of their own citizens. The letter said such action has been taken only once, against Ghana in 2001. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) has said he would seek legislation that would sanction countries that refuse to take back their nationals.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that the United States can hold convicted criminals for only six months in detention if a country refuses to accept them. More than 100 immigrants released from detention have later been charged in homicides.\n\n\u201cCountless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced.\u201d\n\nTrump likes to use anecdotes as evidence for associating violent crimes with illegal immigration, telling stories of victims of homicide by undocumented immigrants. He often talks about the deaths of Jamiel Shaw, Kate Steinle and Sarah Root, all killed by people in the country illegally.\n\nClearly, stories like this exist. But as we\u2019ve noted numerous times, there are two important data points to remember when Trump talks about this.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit Trump\u2019s description of aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder. U.S. Sentencing Commission data shows homicides are a small percentage of the crimes committed by noncitizens, whether they are in the United States illegally or not.\n\nSecond, illegal immigration flows across the Southern border in fiscal 2015 were at the lowest levels since 1972, except for in 2011. Earlier this year, there were upticks in border apprehensions of unaccompanied children and their families, compared to 2015. The apprehensions in fiscal 2016 so far have exceeded fiscal 2015, but still indicate an overall decline.\n\n\u201cA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.\u201d\n\nThe figure is correct, but this is misleading and lacks context. The 2011 Government Accountability Office report Trump cites collected reports from 2003 to 2009 to the Department of Justice\u2019s State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, through which states and localities get reimbursed for convicting and incarcerating inmates of illegal or unknown immigration status (mainly from Mexico).\n\nThe study looked at five states (Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas) with the largest populations of such inmates. There were 25,064 homicide arrests for this population, but it comprised 1 percent of the 2.9 million arrests they tracked in the study. About 50 percent of the arrests were related to immigration, drugs or traffic violations.\n\nInmate legal status is not always tracked at local jails and state prisons. This report includes both people who are known to be in the United States illegally, and those who states and local jurisdictions believe are present illegally but whose status can\u2019t be confirmed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\n1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Photos from Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Mexico to meet with President Pena Nieto View Photos In his first formal international trip as the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump visited a country where he is broadly despised for his vilification of illegal immigrants.

(Omar Torres/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt is barely worth pointing out that Donald Trump's surprise visit to Mexico on Wednesday won't do President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto much good. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is deeply unpopular in his home country, with a quarterly survey from the newspaper Reforma putting his favorability at 23 percent \u2014 a figure so low that it makes Trump himself, at 35 percent, seem positively embraced.\n\nThat 35 percent is in the United States, of course. In Mexico, Trump's a lot less popular. A June survey showed Trump at 75 percent unfavorability in the country \u2014 compared with Hillary Clinton's 6 percent. When Ipsos asked people around the world in June who they'd pick in the American presidential contest, no country saw a wider gap than Mexico. Mexico preferred Clinton to Trump by an 88-to-1 margin \u2014 an 87-point spread. (The only countries that preferred Trump were China and Russia.) The next-closest countries were Belgium and Sweden, where Clinton was preferred by 66 points. There's a correlation between Trump's poll numbers and the Mexican economy: When he does better, the value of the peso has dropped.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump is slated to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto as he tries to clarify his past comments about Mexico and immigration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nLess than 12 hours after the news of Trump's visit broke, other Mexican politicians had already weighed in to oppose welcoming Trump to the country. Politico collected some examples. \"We are threatened with war and walls, but we open the National Palace,\" the president of the Mexican Senate wrote, adding that the invitation approved of Trump's \"proposal of demagogy and hate.\" A former diplomat tweeted, \"I feel embarrassed as a Mexican thanks to my president.\" On CNN on Wednesday morning, former president Vicente Fox (who has been outspoken about Trump) disparaged Pe\u00f1a Nieto's decision.\n\n\"I just can't envision him sitting on that chair that was the chair of Pres Washington..He doesn't even know how to run a biz\" Fox on Trump. \u2014 Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) August 31, 2016\n\nThis response is not surprising. From the first moments of his candidacy, Trump railed against Mexico. Even before that, he complained about Mexico on Twitter, in part because he won a lawsuit in the country but hasn't been able to collect.\n\nWhen will the U.S. stop sending $'s to our enemies, i.e. Mexico and others. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2014\n\nFrom our standpoint, though, the bigger question is how this benefits Trump.\n\nIn the past, Pe\u00f1a Nieto has criticized Trump and his proposals. In March, Pe\u00f1a Nieto compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, saying that Trump's \"strident\" rhetoric was of a piece with the arguments those leaders used to gain power. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has also flatly rejected Trump's signature policy proposal, to build a wall on the border and have Mexico pay for it. Not going to happen, Pe\u00f1a Nieto said to Fareed Zakaria of The Washington Post and CNN: \"There is no way that Mexico can pay [for] a wall like that.\"\n\nAfter Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto meet, that will be the first question that's asked of Trump. Did Pe\u00f1a Nieto agree to pay for the wall? (Unless, of course, Trump's arrival is met with the sort of demonstrations that his appearances have earned in the past in San Jose and San Diego.) Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 unpopular! \u2014 has a clear political incentive to embarrass Trump on the issue, a sort of I-invited-him-here-to-boss-him-around sort of thing. It's perhaps Pe\u00f1a Nieto's only possible positive political outcome. But even if things progress quietly, it forces the issue: Trump says he'll make Mexico pay, and Mexico says it won't. Now what? Trump has never been able to answer that question.\n\nUpdate: Sure enough.\n\n(One deeply optimistic Trump supporter, former congressman Joe Walsh, figures that Trump obtaining a promise to pay for the wall would be \"game, set, match,\" which is true. It is also true that if Pe\u00f1a Nieto gives Trump proof that Clinton was a space alien intent on destroying the globe that it would benefit Trump. Neither is likely to happen.)\n\nWhat does Trump get out of it? We assume that Pe\u00f1a Nieto will pose for photos with the visiting dignitary (though that seems like a political miscalculation for him). Trump-as-statesman is a new one, and it will be interesting to see how it's handled. That photo itself encapsulates a lot of the risk-reward calculus for Trump: At best he gets a dull picture of himself standing next to a person with whom most Americans aren't familiar; at worst, he gets an awkward picture posing in front of the Mexican flag \u2014 something that some part of his base probably won't be thrilled about.\n\nThe trip will, at best, show that Trump can go to a foreign country and meet with leaders without incident, a fairly low item on the presidential checklist. (A subject for another time: Do voters actually care about a grip-and-greet?) At worst? Who knows.\n\nThe move feels a bit like John McCain's decision in September 2008 to suspend his campaign to deal with the economy. It felt gimmicky and didn't do much \u2014 and reinforced that McCain was in the sort of political position that necessitated gimmicks that might not do much. Barring a Joe-Walsh-esque miracle, Trump's trip to Mexico instills a lot of risk with the potential upside for Trump being that he proved he can do something fairly simple without incident. For Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the potential upside is that he can score points off an unpopular visitor; the downside is that he is seen as embracing someone his constituents vehemently dislike.\n\nGiven how low the reward is for Trump and how high the possibility that something might go wrong, there\u2019s a decent chance that the politician for whom Trump\u2019s trip is beneficial is his opponent.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/09/Foreign/Images/Mvd6738795.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s high-risk, low-reward trip to Mexico is sort of baffling", "summary": "But even if things progress quietly, it forces the issue: Trump says he'll make Mexico pay, and Mexico says it won't.\nIn Mexico, Trump's a lot less popular.\n(Omar Torres/AFP/Getty Images)It is barely worth pointing out that Donald Trump's surprise visit to Mexico on Wednesday won't do President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto much good.\nPe\u00f1a Nieto has also flatly rejected Trump's signature policy proposal, to build a wall on the border and have Mexico pay for it.\nWe assume that Pe\u00f1a Nieto will pose for photos with the visiting dignitary (though that seems like a political miscalculation for him).", "source": "Guest Writer - Left", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Philip Bump Is A Correspondent For The Post Based In New York City"], "keywords": ["sort", "pea", "mexican", "trump", "lowreward", "mexico", "wall", "country", "highrisk", "baffling", "donald", "trumps", "pay", "president", "nieto", "trip"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-30 09:02:00-05:00", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2016/0830/How-Facebook-keeps-you-in-a-political-bubble-of-your-own", "text": "Despite the opportunities the Internet gives us to know and connect more, the Internet can also train us to polarize each other. But we can change that \u2013 starting with our Facebook preferences.\n\nIn this June 11, 2014, file photo, a man walks past a mural in an office on the Facebook campus in Menlo Park, Calif. Facebook is taking an aggressive new tack that blocks ad blockers on the desktop version of its service, insisting that well-made, relevant ads can be \"useful.\" At the same time, the world's biggest social media company says it is giving users easier ways to decide what types of ads they want to see. Unless, of course, the answer is \"none.\"\n\nDid you know that Facebook estimates your political leanings so it can better target its ads for you? You might have guessed that, and realized that kind of targeting is happening all over the Internet \u2013 with your search results, on websites, in your social networks.\n\nThen you might ask yourself the bigger question: Should I care?\n\nThe level at which online publishers can target their ads is unprecedented. This hit the news again because Facebook released a new feature that gives all of us more control over what advertisements they show us, and this feature exposes how Facebook rates your political preferences.\n\nThis extraordinary power to target users is either cool if you are a techie, exciting if you are trying to make money online, or terrifying if you are a privacy advocate.\n\nFirst let\u2019s give kudos to Facebook for giving users more control and being more transparent about what they do. I suspect it also provides some business advantages \u2013 good PR and slightly reducing the number of ineffective ads, which is good, both for user experience and advertising effectiveness.\n\nWhatever the reason, more transparency and control for users are good things.\n\nBut there is a potential problem.\n\nDespite the opportunities the Internet gives us to know and connect more, the Internet can also train us to polarize and despise each other. Targeted political advertising, whether online or on TV, on the radio, or in print, is another case in point.\n\nIs what Facebook doing a problem?\n\nPerhaps no more than advertising on TV, on the radio, or in the mail. Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, tells Ben Rosen with the Monitor that television is a more powerful form of persuasion than the Internet.\n\nSo, does that mean it is OK?\n\nFalling to a simple status-quo bias, you might not give it a second thought. But you should.\n\nThe alarming growth in division and polarization across the country is not merely the result of our political parties, elected officials, or election laws. It's not purely the result of historical cycles either. All of these things have a real impact, but they do not describe why similar division and polarization is happening at alarming rates across the country and across the world.\n\nModern technology, in particular the Internet in its current form, is the critical commonality and underlying driver to this worldwide phenomenon. With these advancements, we each find ourselves in very dense filter bubbles.\n\nWhy our opinions are rarely challenged\n\nToday more than ever, we only get one side of the story and only relate with people just like us. With our online friends of friends along with neighborhoods that are increasingly homogeneous, most of us have very little authentic experience with people that are truly different.\n\nWith self-selection and ingenious algorithms operating behind the scenes to match our personal preferences, the information and opinions we get are homogeneous and one-sided, devoid of alternative opinions and data that goes against our individual beliefs.\n\nStudy after study demonstrates that when we continually see only one point of view, we tend to become more extreme in our beliefs. We also know that when we get a wider variety of information, and we know and have relationships with people different than us, that we become more open to each other and often moderate, find common ground, or find some way to more forward.\n\nIt doesn't mean we agree, but it does mean we can work together enough to get things done, to solve problems.\n\nProviding everyone more ways to get outside of their filter bubbles so they can see different points of view and interact with people that are different - that is the solution. The Internet can provide ways for us to interact with each other better and more quickly than ever.\n\nOrganizations like AllSides.com, World Table and others offer alternatives designed to help our society and technology evolve to using the Internet in more productive ways that bring us together and solve problems.\n\nYou can also take steps on your own right now.

You can even intentionally \u201clike\u201d pages of politicians or news organizations that you don\u2019t agree with \u2013 that will definitely introduce you up to ideas and opinions that you don't agree with.\n\nThat is a small, simple step.

(Libby March/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn Friday morning, the third day in his four-day New England campaign swing, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson told a joke. He was the punch line.\n\n\u201cThis is a crazy election,\u201d Johnson said, looking out at dozens of Mainers who had come out for a breakfast meet-and-greet. \u201cYou know how crazy this election is? I\u2019m going to be the next president of the United States. That\u2019s how crazy!\u201d\n\nJohnson, a two-term governor of New Mexico, has avoided the fringe label that often sticks to third-party candidates. Since announcing former Massachusetts governor William Weld as his running mate, Johnson has risen in the polls to the high single digits \u2014 and to the mid-teens in some swing states. His rallies draw hundreds of voters, bigger than anything he saw during his 2012 bid. He talks about \u201cspoiling the party,\u201d and voters cheer.\n\nDespite that, Johnson is struggling to grab the prize he has eyed all year: to be invited to the televised presidential debates. He needs to close in on 15 percent in an average of polls, and he is doing what he can. Two super PACs are trying to boost him in. It\u2019s not clear that they can pull it off.\n\n[Trump and advisers remain split on how far to move toward the middle]\n\nRecent U.S. politics has favored candidates from the Democrat and Republican parties, but here are seven examples of candidates who ran under a different mantle. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nThe support Johnson has so far is easily explained; in a year of not one, but two historically unpopular major-party candidates, voters are looking for an alternative to Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Johnson may hold particular appeal for Republicans trying to protect their majorities in Congress; he gives voters an alternative to Trump at the top of the ticket yet allows them to return to the GOP lineup down the ballot.\n\nRelentlessly positive, bounding from event to event in black Nikes and Carhartt jeans, Johnson approaches the debate problem by talking like he has solved it. In 2012, he briefly ran as a Republican \u2014 the party he was part of in Santa Fe \u2014 and was yanked offstage after a first, flailing debate performance.\n\n\u201cI had 60 seconds to make my pitch, and in the 60 seconds, I was being interrupted,\u201d Johnson said in an interview here. \u201cNow, I can say the same thing \u2014 and I\u2019ve got three minutes. Uninterrupted! Three people onstage, audience bigger than the Super Bowl. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d get away with cutting me.\u201d\n\nThey might. The Commission on Presidential Debates, which has controlled the process since 1988, has held fast to its 15 percent threshold. A Johnson-backed lawsuit against that threshold was thrown out this month, however, and the voters filing into Johnson-Weld rallies last week were acutely aware that their man might be kept offstage.\n\n[Inside debate prep: Clinton\u2019s careful case vs. Trump\u2019s \u2018WrestleMania\u2019]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not for either of the choices\u00ad we have right now,\u201d said Roy Hermann, 65, who caucused for Bernie Sanders but showed up in Portland to hear Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll vote for this guy, but I have a great deal of respect for him.\u201d\n\nThe day before, at a Johnson-Weld rally in Concord, N.H., 14-year-old Aubrey Pelletier hoisted a sign that read \u201c15%!\u201d Her father, Brad, 39, worried that too many voters limit the news they read and couldn\u2019t see the point of choosing Johnson.\n\nAlexis and Eli Luicha stand close shelter under an umbrella during Johnson\u2019s rally in Concord.

Fundraising, according to the campaign, has surged in the same period.\n\nNeither Republicans nor Democrats know which nominee that helps. The polls that show Johnson at or above 10 percent have Clinton\u2019s lead growing if he is removed as a choice \u2014 but she has got a lead either way. At rallies in New Hampshire and Maine, voters with Bernie Sanders T-shirts stood near people wearing the \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d shirts sold by far-right radio host Alex Jones.

Purple PAC, steered by former Cato Institute president Ed Crane, began a $1 million ad buy last week, with cable spots casting Johnson as an \u201chonorable choice\u201d who favors tolerance and free markets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not as ideological as I would probably prefer,\u201d Crane said of Johnson and Weld. \u201cBut on the broad issues of social tolerance, restraint in foreign policy, markets over crony capitalism, they\u2019re very good.\u201d\n\nAlternative PAC, launched by former FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, is spending $50,000 to kick-start a Web campaign aimed at millennials. One ad, \u201cBalanced Rebellion,\u201d stars an Abraham Lincoln impersonator who promises that Johnson won\u2019t \u201csend you to fight wars overseas\u201d or \u201ctell you who to marry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a two-horse race where one horse cheats and the other one eats Muslims,\u201d the Lincoln actor says of the Clinton-Trump race.\n\nThe spot was designed by Harmon Brothers, the firm behind a viral ad in which unicorns defecate rainbow ice cream to promote a toilet aid.\n\nJohnson is more tactful. In his campaign speech, an optimistic spiel on how free markets (\u201cUber everything\u201d) and active citizens can fix the country, he tells one joke about Trump. The Republican nominee, he said, watched the Olympics to see \u201chow high those Mexican pole vaulters could go.\u201d Neither Johnson nor Weld is inclined to attack Clinton, something they have been trying to correct.\n\n\u201cYou make mistakes along the trail,\u201d Johnson said in Concord, referring to a CNN town hall \u2014 one of his highest-profile events \u2014 where he declined to criticize Clinton. \u201cIf I had to do that over again, I\u2019d have said: She\u2019s beholden.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a mini-career of defending Mrs. Clinton on the use of the private server,\u201d said Weld, who added that newer revelations about her email gave him pause.\n\nThat light tone has become central to the Johnson-Weld campaign. The two standard-bearers for libertarianism have become some of the least ideological candidates in America.\n\nOn the stump, Weld describes the Libertarian Party as \u201ca six-lane highway going right up the middle between the two parties,\u201d and Johnson talks about what can be achieved when partisans cross the aisle.\n\nThat has led to steady criticism from more traditional libertarians, who pounce on every Johnson or Weld sop to the center as a gaffe. Weld, who signed a gun-control bill as governor, struggled to win the Libertarian vice-presidential nomination. Jason Sorens, the founder of the Free State Project that encourages libertarians to move to New Hampshire, said he had seen \u201csome demobilization of the LP ticket\u2019s natural base over guns.\u201d\n\nAfter Johnson refused to rule out a tax on carbon \u2014 only if it were revenue-neutral and it replaced income taxes \u2014 he was criticized by libertarians on social media.\n\nCrane, Kibbe and other libertarians knew some of this was coming. The Republican primary campaign of Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), designed to build on the support of father Ron Paul\u2019s three \u00adlibertarian-flavored presidential bids, made a bid for conservative voters that put the base to sleep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still on the fence about whether I\u2019m going to cast a write-in vote for \u2018none of the above\u2019 or myself,\u201d said Darryl Perry, a New Hampshire voter who ran against Johnson for the Libertarian presidential nomination. \u201cI know a few [people] who have said, \u2018Well, he\u2019s the lesser of the evils.\u2019 The lesser evil is still evil in my eyes.\u201d\n\nBut the dazzling possibility of the debate invite \u2014 something no Libertarian candidate has ever achieved \u2014 has kept most fellow travelers on board. Dan Fishman, the campaign\u2019s 48-year-old New England director, has walked away from each rally with pages of new sign-ups. \u201cIt\u2019s getting easier and easier to train people,\u201d he said, crediting the NationBuilder software that had helped the Trump campaign convert its \u00adgiant crowds into volunteers.\n\nAt one rally, in Concord, close to 300 people stood in a steady and meteorology-defying rain to hear Weld and Johnson speak about the six-lane highway between the parties.\n\n\u201cStanding in the rain,\u201d Johnson said with disbelief. \u201cYou honor us.

Comey has said there is no evidence that emails were purposefully deleted with an intent to conceal them, and a State Department spokesman said Monday that some of the records included emails that were purely personal.\n\nFBI Director James Comey testified on July 7 at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's decision to use a personal email server while serving as Secretary of State. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIt is not clear when the documents discovered by the FBI will become public, but attorneys for the State Department and Judicial Watch are negotiating a release that is likely to begin before the election and continue long after.\n\nJosh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said in a statement Monday that Judicial Watch is a \u201cright-wing organization that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s\u201d and that the group is \u201cdistorting facts to make utterly false attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as Secretary of State because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,\u201d he said.\n\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Monday that there is \u201cno clear sign\u201d donors received access for their contributions.\n\nThe emails released Monday showed how requests from donors would often come through Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton aide who helped create the foundation, with Abedin as a primary point of contact. Band declined to comment on the newly released emails, and attorneys for Abedin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere is no indication from the emails that Abedin intervened on behalf of Casey Wasserman, an L.A. sports executive who in 2009 asked Band for help getting a visa for a British soccer star trying to visit Las Vegas. Band indicated that the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) had already declined to help, given the player\u2019s criminal record. A Boxer spokesman described the request to her office as \u201croutine\u201d but one with that Boxer did not assist, \u201cgiven the facts of the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cMakes me nervous to get involved but I\u2019ll ask,\u201d Abedin wrote to Band in May 2009 after he forwarded to her an email from Wasserman.\n\nBand responded: \u201cthen dont.\u201d\n\nWasserman\u2019s charitable foundation has given the Clinton Foundation between $5 million and $10 million. In 2009 and 2010, his investment company paid Bill Clinton $3.13 million in consulting fees.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wasserman said the businessman never contacted Bill Clinton on the matter and the visa was never granted.\n\nBand and Abedin also responded dismissively when asked if they had any ideas on how to help Bono get his space station transmission: \u201cNo clue,\u201d they each responded in turn.\n\nThe appeal appears to have had more success in the case of Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain. In June 2009, Band emailed Abedin that the prince would be in Washington for two days and was seeking a meeting with Hillary Clinton. \u201cGood friend of ours,\u201d he added.\n\nAbedin responded that the prince had already requested a meeting \u201cthrough normal channels\u201d but that Clinton had been hesitant to commit. Two days later, Abedin followed up with Band to let him know that a meeting with the prince had been set. \u201cIf u see him, let him know. We have reached out thru official channels,\u201d she wrote to Band.\n\nBahrain has a spotty human rights record but full relations with the U.S. government.\n\nIn a statement, the court of the crown prince said his participation at a 2005 foundation event \u201chappened years before and was wholly unrelated to any meeting with Secretary Clinton,\u201d adding that the prince is deputy head of state of an American ally and so he often meets with U.S. officials.\n\nThe new disclosures come as the Clinton Foundation and its international network of powerful donors have returned to the forefront of the presidential campaign.\n\nOn Monday, Bill Clinton sent an email to foundation staff and supporters outlining new steps and offering a defense of the foundation\u2019s accomplishments. He wrote that the foundation would stop accepting corporate and foreign donations if Hillary Clinton was elected and that he would step down from the charity\u2019s board, along with the board of a related Boston-based health organization. While he said his role would change, \u201cthe work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it.\u201d\n\n[The inside story of how the Clintons built a $2 billion global empire]\n\nThe announcements did little to quell Republican attacks. The GOP nominee, Donald Trump, on Monday called for the foundation to be shut down altogether, describing the charity as \u201cthe most corrupt enterprise in political history.\u201d\n\nThe newly released emails underscored the central role played by Abedin, a top adviser to Clinton\u2019s campaign who has been working for her since Clinton\u2019s time as first lady.\n\nWhen S. Daniel Abraham, a major Democratic donor who had also given to the foundation, was visiting Washington in May 2009 and wanted to see Clinton, the emails showed that he placed a call to Abedin. \u201cDo u want me to try and fit him in tomorrow?\u201d Abedin emailed Clinton, who appeared to indicate in her response that she was willing to make time.\n\nAbraham said in an interview Monday that he talked with Clinton about the Middle East and that his status as a donor had nothing to do with his ability to secure time with the secretary.\n\n\u201cIt was about the issue that I have worked hard on for many, many years, Israeli-Palestinian peace,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been friendly with the Clintons since their White House days. As far as I am concerned it was all good. She never asked me for anything.\u201d\n\nLongtime Clinton friend and fundraiser Maureen White wrote Abedin in July 2009, saying that she would be in Washington three days later. \u201cWould she have any time to spare?\u201d White wrote.\n\n\u201cYes I\u2019ll make it work,\u201d Abedin responded.\n\nWhite went on to serve in the State Department under Clinton. White said she and her husband, Steven Rattner, gave $31,000 to the foundation before 2009 and $25,000 to the foundation in 2012. White said that she did not remember the specific exchange but that she has met often with Clinton as a longtime supporter and has worked on refugee and humanitarian issues in several capacities in and out of government.\n\n\u201cUsually when I told Huma I wanted to meet with Hillary Clinton, Huma made it happen,\u201d White said.\n\nIn another email exchange, Democratic donor and activist Joyce Aboussie of St. Louis wrote to Abedin requesting a meeting between Clinton and a top executive of St. Louis-based Peabody Energy, one of the world\u2019s largest coal producers.\n\n\u201cHuma, I need your help now to intervene please,\u201d Aboussie wrote in June 2009. \u201cWe need this meeting with Secretary Clinton, who has been there now for nearly six months. This is, by the way, my first request.\u201d\n\nAbedin responded: \u201cWe are working on it and I hope we can make something work . . . we have to work through the beauracracy [sic] here.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear whether the meeting took place. Neither Peabody officials nor Aboussie, who donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation, responded to requests for comment.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/08/15/Others/Images/2016-08-15/hrc91471290131.jpg", "title": "Emails reveal how foundation donors got access to Clinton and her close aides at State Dept.", "summary": "Band responded: \u201cthen dont.\u201dWasserman\u2019s charitable foundation has given the Clinton Foundation between $5 million and $10 million.\nNeither Peabody officials nor Aboussie, who donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation, responded to requests for comment.\nThe new disclosures come as the Clinton Foundation and its international network of powerful donors have returned to the forefront of the presidential campaign.\n\u201cUsually when I told Huma I wanted to meet with Hillary Clinton, Huma made it happen,\u201d White said.\n\u201cWe need this meeting with Secretary Clinton, who has been there now for nearly six months.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Spencer S", "Hsu Is An Investigative Reporter Two-time Pulitzer Finalist National Emmy Award Nominee", "Tom Hamburger Covers The Intersection Of Money Politics For The Washington Post", "Rosalind Helderman Is A Political Enterprise Investigations Reporter For The Washington Post"], "keywords": ["reveal", "clinton", "meeting", "donors", "abedin", "clintons", "access", "dept", "state", "aides", "close", "foundation", "2009", "hillary", "emails", "secretary"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "None", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-why-it-s-so-hard-trump-retreat-immigration-n635771", "text": "First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Donald Trump's campaign manager hints at softer immigration policy 2:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nWhy it's so hard for Trump to retreat on immigration\n\nSince launching his presidential candidacy 14 months ago, Donald Trump's most consistent and uncompromising policy issue has been immigration. Indeed, it was the subject of his first general-election TV ad that started airing on Friday. Yet over the weekend, his top aides and advisers suggested that Trump might be shifting on his past position that all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States must be deported forcibly. \"To be determined,\" is what newly minted Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway said on CNN when asked if Trump was retreating on the \"deportation force\" he talked about during the primary season. But here's why it's so hard -- if not impossible -- for Trump to retreat on immigration: He's caught between his clear, unambiguous past statements and a base that might not willing to see him moderate on the issue. His past statements:\n\nAug. 16, 2015 \"We're going to keep the families together, but they have to go,\" Trump said on NBC's Meet the Press.\" More Trump: \"We will work with them. They have to go. Chuck, we either have a country, or we don't have a country,\" he said.\n\nNov. 11, 2015 \"You are going to have a deportation force, and you are going to do it humanely,\" Trump said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" when asked how he would round up the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nApril 21, 2016 \"Look, we're either going to have a country or we're not going to have a country. But many people are very fine people. And I'm sure these are very, very fine people. They're going to go, and we're going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally, okay? But it has to be done legally\" -- when asked by a questioner at a \"Today\" town hall that person's undocumented relatives would have to be deported if Trump becomes president.\n\nTrump can't ignore a base that has cheered his uncompromising immigration position\n\nAnd then there are the Trump supporters who've cheered the GOP presidential nominee for being so uncompromising on immigration. The Washington Post's Dave Weigel: \"Jared Taylor hits play, and the first Donald Trump ad of the general election unfolds across his breakfast table. Syrian refugees streaming across a border. Hordes of immigrants, crowded onto trains. 'Donald Trump's America is secure,' rumbles a narrator. 'Terrorists and dangerous criminals kept out. The border, secure; our families, safe.' Taylor, one of America's foremost \"racialists,\" is impressed and relieved. 'That's a powerful appeal,' he said. 'If he can just stick to that, he is in very good shape.' From his Fairfax County home, Taylor has edited the white nationalist magazine American Renaissance and organized racialist conferences under the 'AmRen' banner. He said that Trump should 'concentrate on his natural constituency, which is white people,' suggesting that winning 65 percent of the white vote would overwhelm any Democratic gains with minorities. When Trump made Breitbart News CEO Steve Bannon his campaign's chief executive last week, Taylor found reasons to celebrate. It was the latest sign for white nationalists, once dismissed as fringe, that their worldview was gaining popularity and that the old Republican Party was coming to an end.\"\n\nClinton camp: This is more about wooing Republicans and swing voters than Latinos and African Americans\n\nTeam Clinton believes that this Trump campaign talk about a possible retreat on immigration -- as well as Trump's recent appeals to African-American voters -- is aimed more at nervous Republicans and swing voters more than Latinos and African Americans. Their argument: If this were an actual play for these minority voters, the Trump campaign would be reaching out directly to these audiences and not airing a new ad on immigration. Most importantly, we've yet to hear directly from Trump on any immigration change. And until we do, all of this is talk rather than any kind of policy change. As National Journal's Ben Pershing observes:\n\nTrump blurts something out on TV Media analyzes strategic \"shift\" There is no \"shift\" (and therefore no strategy).\n\nTrump camp pounces on Clinton Foundation announcement\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign is pouncing on the Clinton Foundation's announcement last week that it won't accept foreign or corporate donations if Hillary Clinton becomes president. \"The Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history, and it's clear that Hillary Clinton and her campaign have no idea how to defend it,\" a Trump official tells NBC News. \"Their refusal to cease foreign and corporate donations only highlights the fact her acceptance of such donations while Secretary of State were a conflict of interest and highly unethical. Until then, the drumbeat to release her FBI testimony and open the books on this shady operation will only intensify.\" Indeed, as the New York Times writes, \"[W]hile the move could avoid the awkwardness of Mr. Clinton jetting around the world asking for money while his wife is president, it did not resolve a more pressing question: how her administration would handle longtime donors seeking help from the United States, or whose interests might conflict with the country's own.\"\n\nColin Powell: Clinton people are trying to pin email scandal on me\n\nMaybe we now know why Colin Powell hasn't endorsed Hillary Clinton yet. People magazine: \"On Friday, the New York Times reported that Clinton told FBI officials former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to use a personal email account while she held the Secretary of State office herself. 'Her people have been trying to pin it on me,' Powell, 79, told PEOPLE Saturday night at the Apollo in the Hamptons 2016 Night of Legends f\u00eate in East Hampton, New York. 'The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did,' Powell added. Why does the former diplomat believe this to be the case? 'Why do you think?' he said. 'It doesn't bother me. But it's okay; I'm free.'\"\n\nClinton camp unveils new TV ad hitting Trump on the commander-in-chief test\n\nThe Clinton camp is up with a new TV ad hitting Trump on the commander-in-chief test. \"All it takes is one wrong move,\" the narrator says after the ad plays clips of Trump saying \"And you can tell them to go f%@& themselves\" and \"I would bomb the sh!% out of them.\"\n\nIt's official: Clinton camp outraises Trump in July, has $20 million more in the bank\n\nOver the weekend, we received the official fundraising numbers from July. Here's the apples-to-apples comparisons, per NBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell:\n\nClinton campaign raised in July: $52.3 million\n\nTrump campaign raised in July: $36.6 million\n\nClinton campaign cash on hand as of July 31: $58.5 million\n\nTrump campaign cash on hand as of July 31: $38.4 million\n\nDNC raised in July: $32.3 million\n\nRNC raised in July: $27.2 million\n\nTotal Clinton/DNC raised in July: $84.6 million\n\nTotal Trump/RNC raised in July: $63.8 million\n\nCaldwell also writes this story: \"With fewer than 80 days until election day, Republican kingmaker Sheldon Adelson still hasn't put any money toward Donald Trump's campaign for president, according to newly released filings from the Federal Election Commission. The snub from Las Vegas casino magnate, who is one of the GOP's largest donors, is another example of the concerns some members of the Republican Party still have with their presidential nominee.\"\n\nA market-by-comparison of the Clinton-vs.-Trump TV ad war\n\nFinally, here is the market-by-market comparison of the amount of money Trump has on the air in the four states where he's now advertising versus the Clinton campaign in these same four states from Aug. 19-29.

Their investment comes as Republicans worry about not only their nominee Donald Trump\u2019s chances, but also his effect on down-ballot races.\n\nYet few of the GOP\u2019s biggest donors have put major money into Trump efforts, a striking change from four years ago when Mitt Romney had more million-dollar donors on his side than did President Barack Obama.\n\nThe presidential candidates and many outside groups must report their July fundraising and spending details to the Federal Election Commission by midnight Saturday. Here\u2019s what we know so far:\n\n___\n\nSOROS RETURNS\n\nBillionaire after billionaire appeared on the latest fundraising reports from Democratic super PACs.\n\nSuper political action committees face no restrictions on how much money they can take from individual, corporate and union donors. Liberals have decried these groups as bad for democracy \u2014 yet they\u2019ve leaned on them to help win races, saying they don\u2019t want to disarm against Republicans.\n\nIn July alone, New York hedge fund billionaire George Soros gave $1.5 million to Planned Parenthood\u2019s super PAC and $35,000 to Priorities USA, both working to elect Clinton, as well as $500,000 to the Senate Majority PAC. Other million-dollar donors to Priorities USA include the creator of diet product Slim-Fast, Daniel Abraham, and Donald Sussman, a financier who is divorcing Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree.\n\nSoros\u2019s latest contributions bring his 2015-2016 super PAC total to more than $14 million \u2014 a fivefold increase from his super PAC investments during the previous presidential election.\n\n___\n\nBILLIONAIRE EFFORTS\n\nAcross the country, California hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is feeling similarly generous.\n\nLast month, he pumped another $7 million into his super PAC, called NextGen Climate Action Committee. In the past two years, he has put into $38 million into the group, which works to defeat politicians who don\u2019t believe in human-caused climate change.\n\nNextGen also is spending heavily to help Clinton, including by giving millions of dollars to labor union super PACs that back her.\n\nAnother billionaire with his own super PAC, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, gave $5 million in July. The group, called Independence USA, backs candidates who want stricter gun control measures.\n\nAlthough that often means boosting the fortunes of Democrats, the super PAC recently began spending to help Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey retain his seat in a tough contest. Bloomberg praised Toomey\u2019s support of expanding background checks as his chief reason for helping him.\n\nBloomberg has also endorsed Clinton.\n\n___\n\nDAD BOOSTS SENATE BID\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC, a group with ties to Minority Leader Harry Reid, netted $7.3 million in July \u2014 its best fundraising yet this year. One of its top donors was Thomas Murphy, a Florida construction executive whose son Patrick Murphy is likely to face off with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The younger Murphy is a Democratic representative who had worked with his family\u2019s company before being elected to office.\n\nOther $1 million donors to Senate Majority PAC were the Greater New York Hospital Association Management Corporation, a network of heath care facilities in the northeast, and the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America.\n\nOn the Republican side, the Freedom Partners Action Fund is typically among the biggest groups spending in Senate races. In July, it counted a single donor, hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer. He gave $1 million.\n\nFreedom Partners is one of many political and policy groups steered by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who are uncomfortable with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and have decided to concentrate on down-ballot races. Likewise, Singer is not a Trump backer.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP HELPERS\n\nThe National Rifle Association, which endorsed Trump over the summer, through its political committee has aired about $5 million in TV ads knocking Clinton. That helped keep pro-Trump messages on the airwaves even as he sat out. (The Trump campaign began advertising this week.)\n\nThe NRA Political Victory Fund\u2019s July fundraising shows that the majority of its $1 million raised came from donors giving $200 or less. The committee had $12.3 million in the bank as this month began.\n\nA pro-Trump group called Great America PAC landed its biggest contribution yet in July, $100,000 from billionaire Charles Johnson, a backer of vanquished GOP Trump rival Jeb Bush and owner of the San Francisco Giants. Great America PAC has spent about $2 million on Trump-themed ads, most of which are aimed at getting viewers to call in to pledge money to the group.\n\n___\n\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PREVIEW BIG NUMBERS\n\nAhead of their filings, Trump and Clinton announced their July fundraising totals.\n\nTrump, who did not raise much money during the primary and had no finance team until late May, has proven a surprisingly strong fundraiser. In July, he raised more than $80 million for his campaign and allied Republican Party groups, his campaign said. That\u2019s just shy of the $90 million Clinton\u2019s aides said they collected in July for her campaign and fellow Democratic committees.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign said it began this month with more than $58 million in the bank. Trump\u2019s campaign said that as of Aug 1 it had $37 million in cash and another $37 million in joint accounts with the Republican National Committee.\n\nCampaign finance documents will give details about how both candidates spent their money in July.", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/soros-feat-image.jpg", "title": "George Soros, Other Democratic Megadonors Plowing Millions Into Clinton, Senate Election Bids \u2013 TheBlaze", "summary": "Soros\u2019s latest contributions bring his 2015-2016 super PAC total to more than $14 million \u2014 a fivefold increase from his super PAC investments during the previous presidential election.\nLast month, he pumped another $7 million into his super PAC, called NextGen Climate Action Committee.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic megadonors, including George Soros and Tom Steyer, are putting millions of dollars into efforts to put Hillary Clinton in the White House and win control of the Senate.\nAnother billionaire with his own super PAC, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, gave $5 million in July.\n(The Trump campaign began advertising this week.", "source": "TheBlaze", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": ["Dave Urbanski"], "keywords": ["donors", "republican", "million", "clinton", "trump", "campaign", "senate", "billionaire", "soros", "money", "theblaze", "pac", "election", "george", "democratic", "super", "plowing", "megadonors", "millions"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-21 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/08/21/suicide-bomber-at-turkish-wedding-was-as-young-as-12-president-says.html", "text": "The suicide bomber in a Turkish wedding party attack that killed dozens of people was between 12 and 14 years old, Turkey's president announced Sunday, blaming the Islamic State terror group for the massacre.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan spoke in a live nationally-televised address in front of Istanbul city Hall.

(IHA via AP)\n\nTurkey has been the target of attacks in the past year that have been claimed by Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) or were blamed on ISIS. In June, suspected Islamic State militants attacked Istanbul\u2019s main airport with guns and bombs, killing 44 people. A dual suicide bombing blamed on ISIS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 victims.\n\nEarlier this week, a string of bombings blamed on the PKK that targeted police and soldiers killed at least a dozen people. A fragile, 2 \u00bd year-long peace process between the PKK and the government collapsed last year, leading to a resumption of the three-decade-long conflict.\n\n\"This was a barbaric attack. It appears to be a suicide attack. All terror groups, the PKK, Daesh, the (Gulen movement) are targeting Turkey. But God willing, we will overcome,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek told NTV television.\n\nDaesh is an Arabic name for ISIS.\n\nSimsek later traveled to Gaziantep along with the country's health minister to visit the wounded and inspect the site of the attack.

Trump told the Dimondale, Michigan, crowd that \u201cwe can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place. A new future requires brand-new leadership.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYou're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Speaking before another largely-white audience in a town whose population is 93 percent white, Trump said, \u201cAnd at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African-American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans. No group. No group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job. It's a disgrace. Tonight, I'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future.\u201d\n\nThe former reality TV star's 95 percent pledge was an ad-libbed moment in a speech that was scripted and delivered with the help of teleprompters, aides that Trump has shunned for much of his campaign in favor of a more off-the-cuff approach. It is the second speech delivered by Trump since Wednesday\u2019s promotion of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who is believed to have been elevated to help the GOP nominee remain focused and on-message.\n\nAs a remedy to the problems that Trump said beset the African-American community in the U.S., Trump prescribed much of his usual policy proposals: school choice, tougher immigration laws, more efficient government and trade policies that promote American job growth.\n\nTrump has struggled thus far with black voters in the election, polling as low as 0 percent and 1 percent at times, although the margin of error could put his actual support among African-Americans higher. President Barack Obama received 96 percent of the African-American vote in his first presidential campaign and 93 percent of it in his successful 2012 reelection bid.\n\n\u201cThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for more than 50 years. Their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools and broken homes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to hold Democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities. At what point do we say enough? At what point do we say enough?\u201d\n\nShortly after the real estate mogul concluded his speech, CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Trump campaign senior adviser Jack Kingston why Trump continued to reach out to the black community in rallies with mostly white audiences held in areas where few African-Americans live.\n\n\u201cMaybe it would have been nice if he went and had a backdrop with a burning car,\u201d Kingston replied. \"His rallies are open to the public. Last night in North Carolina we saw a lot of African-Americans. I wasn't sure about the crowd content tonight\u2026 but they\u2019re open to the public, and I mean, there\u2019s nothing exclusive. The reality is, what he is saying is \u2018I want to talk to you.\u2019\u201d\n\nRepublicans have been urging Trump to reach out to black voters for weeks. In a Facebook Live question-and-answer session hosted by Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich on Wednesday, the former House speaker urged the Republican nominee to reach out to the black community even more directly by speaking in inner cities.\n\n\"Trump going into inner-city Philadelphia and offering a better future could have an amazing result. Because the truth is, no Republican has ever had the courage\" to offer African Americans a compelling reason to vote for the GOP, Gingrich said.\n\nBut such speeches, Gingrich said, would come with \"enormous demonstrations\" because \"left-wing activists cannot allow a Republican to have a genuine conversation in the black community. They understand this is a mortal threat to their power and they will do almost anything to stop him.\"\n\nAt Friday's rally, a day after offering a surprising expression of \u201cregret\u201d if any of his rhetoric had created personal pain, Trump attacked Clinton for not showing similar remorse over her own bevy of scandals and controversial statements. He slammed her record as secretary of state and offered a grim comparison between the Middle East prior to Clinton\u2019s tenure as America\u2019s chief diplomat and the region\u2019s current chaotic state. She is, Trump said, \u201cindifferent to the suffering she has caused.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer tenure as secretary of state may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history, but she is totally without remorse,\u201d he said. \u201cHer failed decisions as secretary of state unleashed ISIS on to the world. But has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused? No.\u201d\n\nTrump also repeated a false claim he has made again and again on the campaign trail: that he opposed the Iraq war. \"Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another,\" he said, \"beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq -- and I opposed it so strongly.\" In 2002, however, he was asked by radio host Howard Stern if he supported the U.S. invasion and replied, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d (During Thursday's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump said: \"I will never lie to you.\")\n\nTrump closed his remarks with a rosy picture of what America would look like with him in the White House, promising to unite the country and heal the wounds created by racial tensions.\n\n\u201cWe have a divided country. It's totally divided. The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity. We will love each other. We will have one country. Everybody will work together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\u201d", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201608/3224/1155968404_5091104069001_5091052117001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "title": "Trump predicts he can win 95 percent of the black vote", "summary": "Trump predicts he can win 95 percent of the black voteDonald Trump promised Friday night that if elected president, he will win 95 percent of the African-American vote in his reelection bid.\n\u201cIf Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job.\nBut such speeches, Gingrich said, would come with \"enormous demonstrations\" because \"left-wing activists cannot allow a Republican to have a genuine conversation in the black community.\nPresident Barack Obama received 96 percent of the African-American vote in his first presidential campaign and 93 percent of it in his successful 2012 reelection bid.\nThe reality is, what he is saying is \u2018I want to talk to you.\u2019\u201dRepublicans have been urging Trump to reach out to black voters for weeks.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Louis Nelson", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": ["trump", "campaign", "win", "reach", "community", "state", "black", "predicts", "country", "vote", "95", "africanamericans", "africanamerican"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-18 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-foundation-to-restrict-foreign-corporate-donations-if-hillary-clinton-wins/2016/08/18/af237cc8-6590-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html?wpisrc=nl_politics&wpmm=1", "text": "Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton speaks at a press conference announcing a new initiative between the Clinton Foundation, United Nations Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies in December 2014.

When asked about it on the campaign trail, he has said that he regrets doing so, accusing the foundation of mismanaging its finances.\n\nThe Boston Globe\u2019s editorial board called on the Clintons this week to shutter the foundation if she became president, saying it would pose an unacceptable conflict, given that some donors were foreign governments and corporations.\n\n\u201cThe inherent conflict of interest was obvious when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009,\u201d the Globe wrote. \u201cShe promised to maintain a separation between her official work and the foundation, but recently released emails written by staffers during her State Department tenure make clear that the supposed partition was far from impregnable.\u201d\n\n[Foreign governments gave millions to foundation while Clinton was at State]\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Clinton ally and former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell in a recent interview with the New York Daily News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem,\u201d Rendell said.\n\nThe foundation, which was renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation after Hillary Clinton left the State Department, has operated since 1997 and expanded in subsequent years into an international charity.

It said it would seek State Department approval for any new foreign government donations or any substantial increase in donations from a preexisting government donor.

On Wednesday, however, he told NBC that the taxi had stopped at a gas station so they could use the bathroom.\n\nMr. Lochte went on to say that the swimmers had been robbed upon returning to the taxi. He ascribed the inconsistencies to \u201ctraumatic mischaracterization\u201d caused by stress. Mr. Lochte emphasized to Mr. Lauer that he considered himself as a victim.\n\nThe episode has created a significant test for the newly collaborative relationship between American and Brazilian law enforcement officials. In the months leading up to the Olympics, the countries worked closely as they tried to improve Brazil\u2019s ability to thwart a terrorist attack. But on Wednesday night, American officials seemed to be in the dark over the detention of Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz.\n\n\u201cWe have seen media reports that two U.S. citizen athletes were detained,\u201d said John Kirby, a State Department spokesman. \u201cWe stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance.\u201d\n\nHours after the swimmers were removed from the plane, it was unclear where they were being held. When asked if United States Olympic officials knew where the American swimmers were, the U.S.O.C. spokesman, Patrick Sandusky, said, \u201cAt this point we are gathering details and have no further comment.\u201d\n\nBrazilian law enforcement officials have kept American diplomatic and law enforcement officials at arm\u2019s length as they have moved forward with their investigation, according to senior American officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing Brazilian investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier Wednesday, a Brazilian judge issued an order to prevent Mr. Lochte, a 12-time Olympic medalist, and Jimmy Feigen, the fourth swimmer involved, from leaving the country as doubts emerged about their statements.\n\nMr. Sandusky declined to comment when asked why United States Olympics officials had allowed Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz to board a plane leaving Brazil despite the continuing investigation.\n\nAgents from Brazil\u2019s Federal Police, an investigative force that oversees the country\u2019s borders, detained Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz at Rio de Janeiro\u2019s main international airport, according to local news reports. Investigators from Rio\u2019s Tourism Police had asked for their passports to be seized so they could be questioned.\n\nShortly after they were removed from the plane, the two men were shown on the Globo television network being escorted to a police station in the airport.

I don\u2019t like to modify.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s transition from mischief-maker at Breitbart to the inner circle of the de facto leader of the Republican Party capped the second shake-up of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in two months.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a veteran pollster and strategist who was already advising Mr. Trump, will become his campaign manager and is expected to travel with the candidate, filling a void that opened up when Corey Lewandowski was fired on June 20.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s loyalists put the best possible face on the changes announced Wednesday, but their timing, after a New York Times article detailing his advisers\u2019 frustration at trying to impose discipline on him, underscored why so many in the party have soured on his prospects: His decisions are often made in reaction to news coverage.\n\nPaul Manafort, the campaign chairman, will retain his title and focus on the political shop but was widely seen as being sidelined: Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway have both developed close relationships with Mr. Trump, and Mr. Bannon is likely to be more amenable to letting him run the sort of media-focused campaign he prefers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting day for Team Trump,\u201d Mr. Manafort wrote in an internal staff memo. \u201cI remain the campaign chairman and chief strategist, providing the big-picture, long-range campaign vision,\u201d he added.\n\nOn a conference call Wednesday morning, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said the moves had been well received, along with a speech on crime reduction that he gave in Wisconsin, pointing to favorable coverage on the MSNBC show \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nUnder Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News has been an amen corner for Mr. Trump, and perhaps more relentless than any other conservative outlet in its criticism of the Republican establishment.\n\nBut what most distresses mainstream party strategists about the union of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign with Breitbart\u2019s guiding vision is the brand of populism that the website has advocated, and that Mr. Trump has championed.\n\nMr. Bannon has overseen a site that is focused primarily on pushing Republicans away from what it calls a globalist agenda and toward a hard-line and often overtly racial one, railing against what it sees as the threats of free trade, Hispanic migration and Islamist terrorism.\n\n\u201cThis is Trump going back to the nativism and nationalism that fueled his rise in the primary,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, who was Mr. Romney\u2019s policy director in 2012. \u201cBut it\u2019s very dangerous to the future of the party because it only further narrows the appeal of a party whose appeal was already narrow going into this cycle.\u201d\n\nMr. Chen called Mr. Trump\u2019s shift \u201ca base reinforcement strategy\u201d and noted that it was very different from the tack of most party nominees, who use the final months of the presidential race to broaden their appeal in hopes of winning over the maximum number of voters.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s policy adviser, speechwriter and warm-up speaker, she added, \u201cMaybe he could use 10 more Stephen Millers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs comfortable as Mr. Trump may feel with Mr. Bannon\u2019s style of politics, their unconventional alliance, and the possibility that the coming weeks could resemble a conservative publicity tour more than a conventional White House run, fueled speculation that Mr. Trump was already looking past November.\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have quietly explored becoming involved with a media holding, either by investing in one or by taking one over, according to a person close to Mr. Trump who was briefed on those discussions.\n\nAt a minimum, the campaign\u2019s homestretch offers Mr. Trump, who has begun to limit his national media appearances to conservative outlets, an opportunity to build his audience and steer his followers toward the combative Breitbart site. Even before announcing the staff shake-up, Mr. Trump intensified his criticism of the mainstream news media in a speech on Tuesday night in which he declared that he was running against the \u201cmedia-donor-political complex.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s elevation of Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway also highlights the growing influence of Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, conservative donors from Long Island. The Mercers are investors in Breitbart, and their foundation funds a host of other conservative activist groups. They spent millions on Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s behalf during the Republican primary, an effort Ms. Conway helped lead. And they began bankrolling a pro-Trump \u201csuper PAC\u201d in recent weeks after becoming friendly with Mr. Trump, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Mr. Kushner.\n\nVideo\n\nAt Breitbart and its sister foundation, the Government Accountability Institute, Mr. Bannon ran a hybrid between a news organization and an opposition-research operation aimed at discrediting Mrs. Clinton. The institute sponsored a book about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s financial entanglements, \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d which spawned various articles in mainstream newspapers last year, including in The New York Times.\n\nRival conservative news organizations viewed Breitbart as something of an outlier, which was evident in the title of an article the Weekly Standard writer Stephen F. Hayes wrote on Wednesday: \u201cTrump Has Decided to Live in Breitbart\u2019s Alternative Reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the merger of the Trump campaign with the kooky right,\u201d William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said of Mr. Bannon\u2019s new role.\n\nMr. Bannon has now joined with Mr. Ailes in a common cause on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, a mission that Breitbart never pretended to deny. But Mr. Ailes\u2019s direct involvement casts a new light on how his network handled Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the weeks before the Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed the sexual harassment lawsuit that led to Mr. Ailes\u2019s forced resignation, Mr. Ailes had been in regular contact with Mr. Trump and met with him at least twice, people briefed on the sessions said.\n\nWhile meetings between a presidential candidate and the chairman of an influential television network are hardly unheard-of, especially with Mr. Trump, Mr. Ailes\u2019s direct involvement in the campaign raises new questions about whether the sessions involved more than the usual complaints about coverage.\n\nBefore Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster, some of the network\u2019s journalists and contributors privately complained that Mr. Ailes was pushing them to be more supportive of Mr. Trump. This drew particular umbrage from longtime Republican staff members and contributors who either opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy on ideological grounds or believed it demanded tough reporting on journalistic grounds.\n\nThere was, though, one prominent conservative voice unambiguously in Mr. Ailes\u2019s corner since the beginning of the sexual harassment scandal: Breitbart.\n\nThe website emerged as a singular defender of Mr. Ailes, with a piece about a planned walkout by network stars loyal to him should he be forced out \u2014 it never came to pass \u2014 and one by Mr. Bannon ridiculing the \u201cminor Murdochs\u201d (the 21st Century Fox chief Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons and co-executives, James and Lachlan), who were seen as leading the push for Mr. Ailes to resign.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/18/us/18TRUMP1/18TRUMP1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump Appoints Media Firebrand to Run Campaign", "summary": "It\u2019s a match made in heaven.\u201dPhotoFor Mr. Trump, though, bringing in Mr. Bannon was the political equivalent of ordering comfort food.\nIn recent months, Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have quietly explored becoming involved with a media holding, either by investing in one or by taking one over, according to a person close to Mr. Trump who was briefed on those discussions.\nBefore Mr. Ailes\u2019s ouster, some of the network\u2019s journalists and contributors privately complained that Mr. Ailes was pushing them to be more supportive of Mr. Trump.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cThis is an exciting day for Team Trump,\u201d Mr. Manafort wrote in an internal staff memo.\nBut Mr. Ailes\u2019s direct involvement casts a new light on how his network handled Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.", "source": "New York Times", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Jim Rutenberg", "Jonathan Martin", "Maggie Haberman"], "keywords": ["run", "trump", "campaign", "media", "firebrand", "ailess", "breitbart", "appoints", "conservative", "donald", "trumps", "mr", "party", "republican", "bannon"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-15 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/15/trump-wants-extreme-vetting-stop-terrorists-border/", "text": "Donald Trump called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to root out potential terrorists attempting to enter the United States, as the Republican presidential nominee Monday rolled out a three-pronged strategy to fight and win what he described as an ideological war pitting radical Islamists against the West.\n\nThe immigration plan fine-tuned Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal during the Republican primaries to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nMany Democrats and Republicans criticized that plan as unconstitutional and un-American, but Mr. Trump still proposed a temporary travel ban on people from terrorist hotbeds until U.S. officials establish a test to measure cultural and civic compatibility with American values.\n\nSticking closely to a prepared set of remarks, the presidential candidate said a new immigration policy was needed immediately to stop a pattern of terrorist attacks inside the United States, including the Boston Marathon bombing and the mass shootings in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, Florida.\n\nMr. Trump said President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton failed to appreciate or effectively combat the danger.\n\n\u201cA Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration: We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the speech in Youngstown, Ohio.\n\nFocusing heavily on terrorism and conflicts in the Middle East, Mr. Trump offered relatively few remarks on other issues and hotspots around the globe.\n\nEven so, he did include a number of clear breaks with U.S. foreign policy establishment orthodoxy, including arguing for a broad partnership with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State group and saying the U.S. military should have seized and held Iraqi oil after the 2003 invasion to cut off Islamic State funding and provide a source of money to pay for U.S. veterans\u2019 health care and benefits.\n\nMr. Trump said the pattern of homegrown terrorist who are immigrants or the children of immigrants underscored the need to vet immigrants, asylum seekers and foreign visitors based on their attitudes toward America.\n\n\u201cI call it \u2018extreme vetting,\u2019 \u201d said the New York billionaire. \u201cOur country has enough problems. We don\u2019t need any more, and these are problems like we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nThe screening would exclude people who support Shariah law, he said, referring to the legal system based on Islam that some followers believe supersedes secular law.\n\n\u201cIn the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,\u201d he said.\n\nPresenting the threat of terrorism in the starkest terms, Mr. Trump said tougher immigration policies must be part of an aggressive strategy to eradicate radical Islam\u2019s \u201cideology of hatred,\u201d much like the U.S. defeated Nazis and the Soviet Union in the 20th century.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan to test people who want to enter the United States mirrored some of the requirements on the citizenship test. However, the test would be applied to people seeking to visit or temporarily live in the U.S.\n\nTerrorism is a top issue in the presidential campaign and potentially Mr. Trump\u2019s best opening to challenge Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state under Mr. Obama as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, grew into a global powerhouse.\n\nMr. Trump began his address minutes after Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden were savaging his foreign policy and questioning his fitness to be commander in chief during a joint rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey last month found that 84 percent of registered voters nationwide named the economy as a \u201cvery important\u201d concern in the election, and 80 percent named \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nClinton and the Islamic State\n\nA week after accusing Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton of being founders of the terrorist group, Mr. Trump detailed how the Islamic State spread on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s watch as secretary of state, including her failed policies in Libya and Syria.\n\n\u201cIncident after incident proves again and again: Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, the temperament and the moral character to lead this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cImportantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all the many adversaries we face \u2014 not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn this country around.\u201d\n\nThe other two prongs of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy against terrorism involved foreign policy.\n\nMr. Trump advocated for a concerted effort abroad to destroy the Islamic State and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, including military strikes on their strongholds, cutting off their financial resources and using cyberwarfare to shut down their online propaganda and recruiting tools.\n\nIn supporting those efforts, he proposed to end U.S. nation-building efforts in troubled states and to team up with countries that back the campaign against radical Islamic groups. He said Cold War foe Russia could be a valuable ally in the fight despite tensions on other fronts.\n\n\u201cWe cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies,\u201d said Mr. Trump.\n\nJohn R. Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has been supportive of Mr. Trump, told Fox News that the candidate demonstrated \u201ccommand on the subject matter\u201d and appeared presidential.\n\nHowever, the speech did little to satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s critics in national security circles.\n\n\u201cThe policies and \u2018pillars\u2019 that were offered as solutions were often vague, and it is not clear they\u2019d actually solve the serious challenges that exist in the region,\u201d said Brian Nussbaum, a terrorism analyst at Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy at the University at Albany, State University of New York. \u201cAs in several other areas of policy, Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy and national security seems a bit nebulous, focused on slogans rather concrete policies.\u201d\n\nAhead of the speech, the Clinton campaign called Mr. Trump \u201cerratic,\u201d \u201cthin-skinned\u201d and \u201cvindictive\u201d and blasted his foreign policy proposals.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Donald Trump is unfit to be our commander in chief. This isn\u2019t overcranked campaign rhetoric \u2014 national security experts across the political spectrum are issuing the same warning,\u201d Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan wrote in a memo.\n\nThe ferocity of the pre-emptive strike against Mr. Trump underscored how vulnerable Mrs. Clinton is to criticism about terrorism and her record as secretary of state.\n\nThe memo argued that Mrs. Clinton, who also was first lady and a U.S. senator, was \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to be commander in chief, compared with Mr. Trump, who he said was \u201cuniquely unqualified.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice is clear,\u201d Mr. Sullivan wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican, but between a responsible leader who will keep us safe, and a volatile man who threatens our security.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Bush adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nBut over time, that approach ran into complications: China and Russia used the fight against terrorism to crack down on Muslim minorities. And the Bush administration eventually discovered that a one-dimensional approach, measuring countries almost exclusively on their commitment to fighting Islamic terrorists, left it little leverage when their partners in counterterrorism took other steps opposed to American interests \u2014 from the Chinese claiming portions of the South China Sea to increasing Russian threats against former Soviet states.\n\nMonday\u2019s speech represented another attempt by Mr. Trump to focus on issues after a rocky period in his campaign, much as he did last Monday with a speech on the economy. He laid the blame for the rise of Islamic extremism on President Obama and Mrs. Clinton. He said they made \u201ca catastrophic mistake\u201d in \u201cthe reckless way in which they pulled out\u201d of Iraq. He charged that Mrs. Clinton compounded the error by attempting to \u201cbuild a democracy in Libya.\u201d\n\nHe argued \u2014 accurately \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton had been a vocal proponent of the American intervention in Libya in 2011, which Mr. Obama has repeatedly acknowledged was the most ill-thought-out foreign policy move in his nearly eight years in office. He also charged that \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel,\u201d a reference to the German chancellor. Germany has taken in tens of thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria, in which fighting between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, rebels opposed to his rule and Islamic State jihadists has claimed 400,000 lives.\n\nMr. Trump offered no criticism of Mr. Assad, but criticized the Obama administration for advocating the removal of the Syrian leader and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who was deposed in the first blush of the Arab Spring, because doing so took out the strongmen who kept the lid on violence in the region.\n\nHe pledged to form a new partnership with Israel, Egypt and Jordan to try to stop the spread of terrorism, including groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. He also suggested that the United States would be well served by joining forces with Russia against the Islamic State.\n\nAnd though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication.\n\nThe kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates \u2014 along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law \u2014 would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeter Feaver, a former Bush administration official who handled Iraq strategy and now teaches at Duke University, and who has signed two letters from national security officials opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, praised Mr. Trump for giving a \u201csurprisingly serious\u201d speech on counterterrorism.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is not a perfect copy \u2014 we never contemplated seizing the oil for our own purposes and we were far more concerned about how anti-Muslim rhetoric might demoralize the moderate Muslim voices we were seeking to empower. But the good parts are not new \u2014 they are imported from the Bush approach \u2014 and the new parts are not good.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not explain how his vision of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants, including an \u201cideological test,\u201d would be enforced, or how it would be different from when prospective terrorists lie on questionnaires now. But he made clear that he views the recent terrorist attacks in the United States through the prism of immigration, pointing out that the common point between the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and the mass attack in San Bernardino, Calif., was that they were carried out \u201cby immigrants, or the children of immigrants.\u201d\n\nAs part of the ideological battle against the Islamic State, he said, a Trump administration will \u201cbe a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East,\u201d and would speak out \u201cagainst the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings.\u201d\n\nBut he never squared that with the real-life complexities he would confront in the Oval Office. Pakistan, where one recent honor killing occurred that Mr. Trump cited at length, is also considered a key partner in the counterterrorism fight \u2014 even though its intelligence service has, at times, been accused of supporting the Taliban.\n\nJake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy chief, argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about respecting minority rights within the Muslim religion was not sincere. \u201cThis so-called \u2018policy\u2019 cannot be taken seriously,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHow can Trump put this forward with a straight face when he opposes marriage equality and selected as his running mate the man who signed an anti-L.G.B.T. law in Indiana? It\u2019s a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country, and no one should fall for it.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Mr. Trump said that if he is elected, \u201cthe era of nation-building will be ended,\u201d implicitly criticizing efforts to restore stability to Iraq and Afghanistan. He did not note that most of that nation-building began in the Bush administration, and much of it was terminated by President Obama.\n\nMr. Trump was clearly defensive about challenges to his claim that he had opposed the invasion of Iraq, notably a Sept. 11, 2002, comment to Howard Stern, the radio host, in which he was asked whether he supported a future invasion of the country. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d he responded, \u201cI wish the first time it was done correctly,\u201d a reference to the Persian Gulf war. The day of the invasion in 2003, he described it as a \u201ctremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201d\n\nBut in his speech, Mr. Trump quoted himself from an August 2004 statement to Esquire when the Iraq war was beginning to turn against the United States.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that all the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong,\u201d he said, 17 months after the invasion. \u201cAll this for nothing.\u201d He noted that he had warned that \u201ctwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201d", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/16/us/16trumpterror2/16trumpterror2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Terrorism Plan Mixes Cold War Concepts and Limits on Immigrants", "summary": "And though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication.\nHe did not note that most of that nation-building began in the Bush administration, and much of it was terminated by President Obama.\n\u201cIt turns out that all the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong,\u201d he said, 17 months after the invasion.\nMonday\u2019s speech represented another attempt by Mr. Trump to focus on issues after a rocky period in his campaign, much as he did last Monday with a speech on the economy.\nHe laid the blame for the rise of Islamic extremism on President Obama and Mrs. Clinton.", "source": "New York Times", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["David E", "Sanger Maggie Haberman", "Maggie Haberman"], "keywords": ["trumps", "trump", "limits", "mr", "immigrants", "administration", "bush", "mixes", "islamic", "donald", "speech", "plan", "concepts", "policy", "president", "cold", "iraq", "war", "terrorism"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-14 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/mike-pence-taxes.html?ref=politics", "text": "Photo\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ind. \u2014 Gov.

The Clinton campaign, in an effort to pressure Donald Trump into releasing his taxes, released the Clintons' 2015 numbers. The Clintons made $10.6 million combined, mostly from speeches, and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, also released 10 years' returns. In 2015, Kaine made about $313,000 and paid a 16.1 percent tax rate. (Here are all the tax returns released by the Clinton campaign.)\n\nClinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have already released tax returns dating to the 1970s given their long history in public life. The Clintons, in June of last year, released the previous eight years of returns. Here's some of what we found out from those, as reported by NPR's Scott Horsley:\n\nIncome: The Clintons \"earned $139 million since 2007. They paid nearly $44 million in federal taxes during that period.\" Much of that income came from paid speeches.\n\nThe Clintons \"earned $139 million since 2007. They paid nearly $44 million in federal taxes during that period.\" Much of that income came from paid speeches. Tax rate: The couple's effective federal tax rate ranged from 25 percent in 2007 to 36 percent last year. (The average American pays about 10 percent in tax. The wealthiest pay about 25 percent.)\n\nThe couple's effective federal tax rate ranged from 25 percent in 2007 to 36 percent last year. (The average American pays about 10 percent in tax. The wealthiest pay about 25 percent.) Charity: \"The Clintons ... gave between 8 and 15 percent to charity\" (mostly through the Clinton Family Foundation).\n\nIt has become tradition in U.S. presidential politics that the party standard-bearers release their tax returns. In fact, every major-party nominee in recent history has done so. Trump, though, has declined to follow suit. Why? Trump says he is being audited by the IRS and won't release his taxes until that audit is done. But there's nothing preventing Trump from releasing his taxes while under audit, a point the Clinton campaign and its supporters have pressed, arguing that Trump must be hiding something.\n\nIt's possible Trump pays $0 in taxes, or close to it, the New York Times reported, because of deductions for real estate developers. There's some history of that for Trump, who \"reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums \u2014 a total of less than $75,000 \u2014 for the prior three years,\" the Times wrote.\n\nTrump himself fueled that speculation when he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in May, \"I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.\"\n\nABC News via YouTube\n\nThat Americans demand that the people who run for president serve up what amounts to a financial colonoscopy is something of an odd, voyeuristic tradition. (You can read all of the released tax returns from past presidents and vice presidents and the current 2016 field here at the Tax History Project's archive. Candidates are also required under federal law to release financial disclosures that show ranges of the worth of assets and debts.)\n\nBelow are three reasons we care about what's in those tax returns \u2014 and a little history of where this tradition came from.\n\nFirst, A Little History\n\nIt's a political cliche to say that if you want a friend in Washington get a dog.\n\nAnd the origin of politicians releasing their tax returns goes back to Richard Nixon \u2014 and his cocker spaniel.\n\nNixon, running as Eisenhower's vice president in 1952, was accused of financial wrongdoing \"related to a fund established by political backers to pay for campaign expenses,\" Joseph J. Thorndike of the Tax History Project wrote in 2012.\n\nNixon admitted to taking one gift \u2014 Checkers, the family dog \u2014 from a donor. \"[T]he kids, like all kids, love the dog,\" Nixon said, \"and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're gonna keep it.\"\n\nWhat's become known as Nixon's \"Checkers speech\" was all an attempt to clear his name. He challenged the Democratic Party ticket, headed by Adlai Stevenson, to \"make a complete financial statement as to their financial history,\" as he believed he had.\n\nIf they didn't, Nixon alleged, it would be proof \"they have something to hide.\" So Stevenson and his running mate, Alabama Sen. John Sparkman, released a decade of their tax returns. Eisenhower, the guy at the top of the ticket with Nixon, even released a summary of his own taxes.\n\nNixon, though, did not.\n\nThe practice of releasing taxes didn't become tradition until 21 years later \u2014 again involving Nixon. PolitiFact wrote:\n\n\"The IRS audited Nixon in 1973, when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system, according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society. (This happened around the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate issue.) Nixon said one of his most well-known lines amid this scandal: 'People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook'. \"Nixon eventually released a slew of financial information to the public in December 1973, including the previous four years of tax returns, to try to quell the criticism. He asked a congressional committee to examine them, too. However, the congressional investigation ultimately found that Nixon owed $476,431 (approximately $2.3 million in today's dollars) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest. Oops.\"\n\nFrom that point on, tax-return disclosure became the norm for people wanting to be president.\n\nReasons We Care\n\n1. Conflicts of interest: Almost every candidate who runs for public office is fairly wealthy. (Even the candidates who have the government pay their salary, like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, make far more money than the average American.) Because of that wealth, how they made their money (we'll get to heart in a second) can tell you whether they have potential conflicts of interest \u2014 who they made that money from.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Richard Drew/AP Richard Drew/AP\n\nTrump's business interests all over the world could become entangled with presidential politics. Just look at his response to Brexit \u2014 that the dropping euro could be good for tourism to places like his Scottish golf course. For the Clintons, the Clinton foundation could also raise the issue of conflicts of interest as it raises gobs of money from foreign entities. Would some of those governments expect special treatment from a second President Clinton? A look at recently released emails from her time at the State Department \u2014 and what aides did for big Clinton foundation donors \u2014 gives people reason to question.\n\n2. Do they have heart? Tax returns tell us how much candidates give to charity. The Clintons, as noted above, gave between 8 and 15 percent \u2014 or about $15 million total \u2014 during that eight-year period. Most of that went through the Clinton Family Foundation, as The Atlantic reported. They also contributed to the Nelson Mandela Foundation, First United Methodist Church and the Humana Challenge golf tournament.\n\nPeople could have questions about why so much of their money went to their own foundation \u2014 and whether that's really in the spirit of giving. For Trump, on the other hand, it took a Washington Post investigation to unearth that he hadn't given $1 million to veterans' charities, as he had promised after a fundraiser he held earlier this year (an event he held in competition with a debate he decided not to attend because he was upset that Fox News' Megyn Kelly was moderating). Trump eventually laid out how much was raised and allocated in a testy news conference. So is criticism of Trump unfair? Is he really quietly a very charitable person \u2014 or not? Tax returns would reveal that.\n\n3. Are they like us? Again, these candidates are much wealthier than the average American. Median household income in this country is $53,482, according to the census. The Clintons made $28 million in 2014 (mostly from speeches). They also live in a posh New York suburb, Chappaqua, where they bought their home for $1.7 million in 1999 just before leaving the White House. (In 2016 money, that appreciates to about $2.5 million.) The average home price in the U.S. in June 2016 was $358,000 (median home price was $307,000).\n\nTrump, of course, makes it a point to say he's \"really rich,\" claiming he's worth $9 billion. Trump's net worth is something of a mystery. He says it fluctuates even based on his own \"feelings.\" The Washington Post reported this week on a 2007 deposition that caught Trump in repeated lies and exaggerations when it came to his wealth and earnings. His tax returns would certainly clarify whether he is as rich as he says.\n\nThere's also the business of tax rates. The Clintons have paid a fairly high tax rate over the years. Trump, on the other hand, has boasted that, \"I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible\" and called his tax rate \"none of your business.\" But when a candidate fights hard to pay less in taxes than most people, especially when he is uber-rich, that can be a political problem. That was certainly the case in 2012, when the Obama campaign and its outside group allies were able to paint Mitt Romney as someone who got away with paying less in taxes. (Romney paid an effective tax rate of 14 percent because so much of his income came from dividends and capital gains.)", "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/08/12/ap_520928015_wide-7cf61cb3f7fd012a745f389f6ac46ec10d98706d.jpg?s=1400", "title": "Why Do We Care About Hillary Clinton And Donald Trump's Taxes", "summary": "The Clinton campaign, in an effort to pressure Donald Trump into releasing his taxes, released the Clintons' 2015 numbers.\n)Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have already released tax returns dating to the 1970s given their long history in public life.\n)Below are three reasons we care about what's in those tax returns \u2014 and a little history of where this tradition came from.\n(Here are all the tax returns released by the Clinton campaign.\nIt has become tradition in U.S. presidential politics that the party standard-bearers release their tax returns.", "source": "NPR", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Domenico Montanaro"], "keywords": ["clintons", "clinton", "trump", "paid", "million", "tax", "donald", "taxes", "released", "hillary", "trumps", "returns", "nixon", "care"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-11 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-vows-to-kill-trans-pacific-partner/", "text": "Hillary Clinton vowed Thursday to kill the Pacific trade deal that she helped push just a few years ago as President Obama\u2019s top diplomat, hoping to win over wavering liberals and steal some of the anti-trade thunder from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nMrs. Clinton also promised an expansive role for the government in managing the U.S. economy, calling for higher taxes to fund more infrastructure, more regulations to rein in Wall Street, a new phase of Obamacare, a round of school construction and incentives to get businesses to hire blue-collar workers and do more manufacturing in the U.S.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee took pages from Mr. Obama\u2019s economic plans, echoing his calls for an infrastructure bank and a clean energy surge. Still, she kept the president at arm\u2019s length by acknowledging \u201cvery real economic challenges\u201d throughout his eight years in office.\n\n\u201cThere is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are common-sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed.\u201d\n\nHer solutions also borrowed from Sen. Bernard Sanders, big-business advocates and even her husband, former President Bill Clinton, resulting in an economic plan that tried to offer a little of something to everyone.\n\nFor college students, she promised debt-free tuition. For those who don\u2019t want to go to college, she said the government should help them learn skills. For struggling communities, she said she would expand a controversial tax credit. For those worried about income disparity, she said she would impose a minimum tax to force the wealthy to pony up. For those upset over the Wall Street crash, she promised more financial regulations. For small businesses, she said she would simplify their taxes so it\u2019s \u201cas easy as printing out a bank statement.\u201d\n\nNowhere was she more adamant, though, than in rejecting the free trade spirit that her husband pioneered as a new kind of Democrat in the 1990s and that Mr. Obama continued during his tenure.\n\n\u201cI will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d she said. \u201cI oppose it now, I\u2019ll oppose it after the election and I\u2019ll oppose it as president.\u201d\n\nShe said she voted against the only multilateral trade deal to come before the Senate during her tenure but glossed over the rest of her record, including support for six bilateral trade deals, most-favored status for Chinese trade and her husband\u2019s implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization.\n\nLiberal groups were thrilled that she went so far in denouncing the TPP, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s chief foreign policy objectives, and said her speech overall was the kind of leftward shift they wanted to see after she defeated Mr. Sanders in the primary.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s speech shows that getting some Republicans to say Donald Trump is unfit to be president is not mutually exclusive with Clinton running on bold progressive ideas like debt-free college, expanding Social Security benefits, Wall Street reform, and a public health insurance option,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nOn infrastructure and trade, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are competing to outdo each other.\n\nMr. Trump told CNBC on Thursday that he would more than double the $250 billion investment that Mrs. Clinton envisions, and he encouraged massive government borrowing now.\n\n\u201cThe interest rates are so low \u2014 the numbers are so low \u2014 that yes, this is a time to borrow and to borrow long-term,\u201d he said, ticking off spending on the military, veterans, and roads and bridges as areas where the government should go deeper into debt.\n\nBut despite their areas of agreement, Mrs. Clinton said voters should be wary of Mr. Trump, who she said built his empire by jilting small-business owners. She pointed to contractors she said worked for Mr. Trump who, when they went to collect, were told to scram \u2014 and who didn\u2019t have the kinds of resources to force legal fights with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because Trump couldn\u2019t pay them; it was because he wouldn\u2019t pay them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we do business in America.\u201d\n\nRepublicans warned voters to be wary of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s promises because her record suggests she would embrace free trade once in office.\n\nHer eight years in the Senate earned Mrs. Clinton a lifetime rating of 46 from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 putting her in the middle of the pack of her Democratic colleagues at the time. Some Southern Democrats posted much higher ratings, while liberal stalwarts in the Northeast and Rust Belt \u2014 including Sens. Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden \u2014 posted lower scores.\n\nMrs. Clinton scored well on votes that called for federal investment, but her Chamber of Commerce score suffered based on votes in which she backed union interests, additional red tape or environmental regulations that business groups said would stifle free enterprise.\n\nThe National Federal of Independent Business, the chief lobby for small businesses in the U.S., welcomed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call for easier tax filings and less red tape but said she should detail exactly which of Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations she would end.\n\nJuanita Duggan, president of the business federation, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s flat rejection of a rate cut for the top income brackets will hurt small businesses, most of which file their taxes that way.\n\n\u201cCutting their taxes means letting them reinvest in growth and jobs. That\u2019s precisely what the economy needs,\u201d Ms. Duggan said. \u201cWe would urge the secretary to reconsider her opposition to reducing small-business income taxes.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

And the prospect fed a perception that, with a contentious primary behind her, the Democratic nominee has returned to her old, hawkish ways and is again taking progressives for granted.\n\n\u201cWhat does Kissinger, a veritable war criminal, do to help win over these voters?\u201d Alex Shephard asked in the New Republic.\n\nWrote Greg Grandin in the Nation: \u201cKissinger is a unique monster.

The prospect of Kissinger having influence in a Clinton White House is downright scary.\u201d\n\nThe number of influential Republican officials saying that they can't vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is growing as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) pledges she won't vote for Trump. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThese progressives opposed the national security decisions Clinton made in the Senate and the State Department. They already felt that their questions about her were not answered in the primaries, which is why so many of them backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). With his campaign in the rearview mirror, they see Clinton courting the sorts of Republicans they have worked against for decades \u2014 and it angers them.\n\n[Clinton rolls out more GOP endorsements, announces new Republican outreach]\n\n\u201cIt amuses me how Democrats who once found these people appalling are now cheering them as useful weapons in their glorious battle against Trump,\u201d said Doug Henwood, a journalist who has written extensively about why progressives should not trust Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a big fan of Obama\u2019s, but I\u2019m already getting nostalgic for him. Hillary\u2019s into all the stupid s--- he\u2019s somewhat tried to avoid.\u201d\n\nAs first lady, Clinton was viewed by Republicans as the most liberal member of a dangerously left-wing political family. But as a politician, she assembled a long list of differences with progressives, starting with her 2002 vote to allow U.S. military intervention in Iraq. Her narrow loss in the 2008 presidential primary was celebrated by Democratic doves, who believed they\u2019d defeated a political establishment that too easily veered into war.\n\nIn 2015, when it appeared that Clinton would have a lazy stroll to the nomination, neoconservatives such as Robert Kagan suggested that she would be acceptable to Republicans and hawks. The rise of Sanders made the Clinton campaign skittish about such talk and unlikely to draw attention to praise from hawks.\n\nAt a February 2016 debate in Milwaukee, Sanders shamed Clinton for writing that Kissinger was a friend who \u201cchecked in with me regularly, sharing astute observations about foreign leaders and sending me written reports on his travels.\u201d\n\n\u201cI happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.\u201d\n\nSecret Service agents rushed to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s side at a rally in Des Moines, Aug. 10, stopping a protester who was running at the stage. Clinton didn\u2019t stop speaking during the incident. (The Washington Post)\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s romp through the Republican primaries rattled some supporters loose, the Clinton team hesitated to publicize the endorsements until Sanders\u2019s campaign was over.\n\nBut on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, many Sanders delegates watched in agony as retired generals took the stage and endorsed Clinton. What Clinton\u2019s campaign packaged as a popular front against a dangerous candidate, progressives saw as a needless swing to the right \u2014 one that empowered discredited foreign policy thinking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Clinton will change her foreign policy because she\u2019s receiving endorsements from Bush, Reagan and Nixon foreign policy officials,\u201d said Glenn Greenwald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning co-founder of the Intercept. \u201cI think she\u2019s receiving those endorsements because they like what her foreign policy will be. That\u2019s what worries me.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s post-convention polling surge may have reduced the leverage of progressive voters. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday, Clinton is winning 11 percent of Republican registered voters, similar to 13 percent for Barack Obama in August 2008. Just 14 percent of Democratic-leaning voters who wanted Sanders to win the primary do not support Clinton in a two-way race, compared with 30 percent of Clinton supporters who did not support Obama in August 2008.\n\nMuch of that, progressives say, is because of the real threat of a Trump presidency. Since conceding the primary, Sanders has relentlessly warned his supporters not to oppose Clinton\u2019s campaign. (He declined through a spokesman to comment for this article.) Noam Chomsky, a left-wing intellectual who has criticized Kissinger\u2019s foreign policy interventions for decades, said it still makes sense for voters to unite against Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, but it cannot give me pause, since the alternative is vastly worse, even on endorsements,\u201d Chomsky said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the significance of neocons endorsing Clinton, probably not because they particularly like her but because they are concerned, sometimes terrified, about Trump.\u201d\n\nThe conservatives abandoning the GOP over Trump have the same concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking up so that when my grandchildren come home from college and ask me what I was doing in this election, I can tell them,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a co-founder of the Project for a New American Century who signed the \u201cletter of 50\u201d and planned to write in the name of Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) for president. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say to Sanders voters is: Can\u2019t you accept the possibility that there are people you disagree with, but who are on your side this time?\u201d\n\nWhat neither the critics nor the endorsers can know is how the cross-party endorsements will affect a possible Clinton administration.

Abedin was advising Teneo while working as a senior Clinton aide at the State Department.\n\nWhile she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton also handpicked Teneo co-founder and CEO Declan Kelly as her economic envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\nIn a separate email exchange, Band emailed Abedin and Mills requesting help connecting Clinton Foundation mega-donor Gilbert Chagoury with the State Department\u2019s \u201csubstance person\u201d on Lebanon affairs.

Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said the comments weren\u2019t at all an endorsement of violence, but rather a statement about Clinton and the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cHe was talking about Hillary Clinton and gun control ... Hillary Clinton is a gun grabber,\u201d Pierson told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cMr Trump was clearly pointing that out as he does every day on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nTapper noted that Trump appeared to be talking about voters\u2019 responses after Clinton were elected. But Pierson said her boss was talking about what \u201ccould happen\u201d and how voters should get out and vote to protect their right to bear arms.\n\nHe was just saying go vote. Trump communications adviser Jason Miller said his boss\u2019 comments were meant to spur \u201cAmerican voters who are passionate about their Second Amendment rights ... to use that power at the ballot box.\u201d Any suggestion otherwise, Miller told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett, was \u201cdesperate,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe uses metaphors all the time. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Trump\u2019s comments were simply a play on words. \u201cWhat he meant was we can stop Hillary Clinton from being elected,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. Blitzer noted that Trump was talking about a future when Clinton was already in office, but Hunter responded that Trump sometimes \u201csays things that the way they come out are not the way he means.\u201d\n\nClinton lies more than Trump is outspoken.

On opposing war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in Yemen and war crimes and occupation committed by the Israeli government in Palestine,\" Stein ticked off.\n\n\"And on so much more we have been ahead of the curve for decades, and all of a sudden that curve is catching up to us.\"\n\nStein took aim equally at both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump. She told NPR in a brief interview after her nomination that she wasn't trying to be a spoiler candidate and backing her wasn't a wasted vote.\n\n\"If our voting system has no room for our values or for our moral compass, then we just keep getting more of this screwing that we've been getting by the two corporate political parties,\" Stein said in stark terms.\n\nNPR's Jessica Taylor interviews Green Party nominee Jill Stein at her nominating convention in Houston. Posted by NPR Politics on Saturday, August 6, 2016\n\nThroughout the day, chants of \"Jill Not Hill\" and \"No More War\" broke out. Many attendees also held up their own \"No TPP\" signs similar to ones that Sanders supporters waved as they disrupted the Democratic National Convention last month in Philadelphia.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke to the group via satellite from the Embassy of Ecuador in London, where he's been living for the past four years as he faces extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations. His group was responsible for posting more than 20,000 emails from the DNC showing they were trying to undermine Sanders.\n\nThe controversial figure was introduced as a \"hero,\" and after some technical problems getting the sound to work, he got some of the most rousing applause of the day as he condemned the major party's candidates in very graphic language.\n\nYou're asking me if I prefer cholera or gonorrhea.\n\n\"You're asking me if I prefer cholera or gonorrhea,\" he said when asked to choose between Clinton or Trump.\n\nDr. Cornel West, a social justice advocate and academic who was one of Sanders' most fervent surrogates, also cast the choice of either major party candidate as a horrific one.\n\n\"We understand the difference between a neo-fascist catastrophe and a neo-liberal disaster,\" West said in endorsing Stein.\n\nThere are some big hurdles for Stein before she can be a real factor on the ballot this fall. She needs to get to 15 percent to just make the debate stage, and right now she's polling at about 5 percent. But she points out that's much better than she was ever expected to do (four years ago she got just 0.36 percent of the vote), and with many former Sanders voters coming to her camp, she can only go up.\n\nBut while there was a vocal contingent of onetime Sanders lovers in Houston this weekend, it's not the mass exodus that Stein needs. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll this week shows Clinton has shored up support from 86 percent of former Sanders supporters.\n\nStein will have to tamp down some of her own controversies, too. She's a medical doctor, and in a Reddit AMA earlier this year, she seemed to raise questions about whether vaccines can cause autism \u2014 a link that has been disproved. She's walked that back somewhat, saying she's simply skeptical of the FDA approval process, but she seems to have been trying to woo some anti-vaccinators to her side as well.\n\nShe's also pointed to some studies that raised questions about the effects of Wi-Fi on children's brains, saying that a regulatory agency should look at the issue.\n\nThe three-day convention wasn't without its flashpoints either. As the roll call vote began, candidate Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza-Curry rose to complain that she was being discriminated against during the process as a black Muslim woman, and had been left off the voting slate. She said the party needed a more diverse nominee than the 66-year-old Stein, whom she had called a \"privileged older woman\" in a press conference earlier Saturday.\n\nAs she walked away from the roll call vote after speaking, she literally dropped the mic with a thud that reverberated throughout the auditorium.", "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/08/06/gettyimages-478193146_wide-7da81f5902f536b0545779c819e4a8ceddbb9566.jpg?s=1400", "title": "Green Party Officially Nominates Jill Stein", "summary": "NPR's Jessica Taylor interviews Green Party nominee Jill Stein at her nominating convention in Houston.\nJill Stein Wins Green Party Nomination, Courting Disaffected Sanders SupportersEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesThe Green Party officially nominated Jill Stein for president and human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate on Saturday, at a convention in Houston that attracted many disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters.\n\"She cast herself and the Green Party as the precursor to the Sanders movement, arguing they had first championed many of the same ideas that fueled his unlikely rise.\nThe three-day convention wasn't without its flashpoints either.\n\"I want to thank Bernie Sanders supporters who refused to let the political revolution die,\" Stein said in her acceptance speech.", "source": "NPR", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Wikileaks When Asked To Choose Between Clinton Or Trump", "Jessica Taylor", "Julian Asssange"], "keywords": ["sanders", "nominee", "stein", "wasnt", "convention", "jill", "green", "shes", "nominates", "party", "officially", "war"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "None", "url": "http://time.com/4442498/donald-trump-economic-speech/?xid=homepage", "text": "", "image": "", "title": "", "summary": "", "source": "Time Magazine", "bias": "Bias: Left", "authors": [], "keywords": [], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-06 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/06/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-short-circuit/index.html", "text": "Windham, New Hampshire (CNN) Donald Trump pumped up his attacks on Hillary Clinton's character Saturday night by suggesting that the former secretary of state is not mentally fit to be president.\n\n\"She took a short-circuit in the brain.

She is a horrible, horrible human being,\" Trump told a crowd of supporters gathered in a sweltering New Hampshire high school gym. \"She's incompetent and I don't' think that you can even think of allowing this woman to become president of the United States.\"\n\nBut before taking the stage in New Hampshire, Trump previewed the \"short-circuit\" line of attack online, tweeting earlier Saturday that \"anybody whose mind 'SHORT CIRCUITS' is not fit to be our president! Look up the word 'BRAINWASHED.'\"\n\nAnd in a video posted on his Facebook page earlier Saturday, Trump's campaign suggested Clinton was \"melting down,\" calling her \"robot Hillary.\"\n\nClinton's use of the term \"short-circuited\" came as she answered a question Friday at a gathering of black and Hispanic journalists about her recent assertion in a Fox News interview that FBI Director James Comey said she had been \"truthful\" in discussing her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Clinton's claim in that interview has been widely debunked as false.\n\n\"I was pointing out in both of those instances, that Director Comey had said that my answers in my FBI interview were truthful. That really is the bottom line here,\" she said. \"What I told the FBI, which he said was truthful, is consistent with what I have said publicly. I may have short-circuited, and for that, I will try to clarify.\"\n\nStumping Saturday night, Trump also alleged that the terrorist group ISIS is dreaming of a Clinton presidency.\n\n\"Remember, remember, remember ISIS is looking, folks. They dream of Hillary Clinton,\" Trump said. \"They look at her and they say this can't be happening to us. How great is this.\"\n\nTrump's latest barrage of attacks against Clinton -- while not a departure from his brand of personal and aggressive attacks against his opponents -- did mark an escalation in his attacks, just as Clinton and her allies are stepping up their attacks against Trump.\n\nClinton has accused Trump of being \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president and a slew of top former government officials have raised questions about Trump's character and his fitness to become the next commander-in-chief.\n\nMichael Morell, the former head of the CIA, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Trump \"is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.\"\n\n\"The character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief,\" Morell wrote, pointing to Trump's \"obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights\" and \"his routine carelessness with the facts.\"\n\nTrump also pushed back on those attacks on Saturday.\n\n\"I get a kick out of these dopey, dopey, dopey people.

He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very mixed economic picture now,\u201d said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton\u2019s economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. \u201cYou can\u2019t say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole\u2019s arguments.\u201d\n\nWhat Should You Take Away From the Jobs Report?

Facebook Live Watch\n\nThe July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June.\n\nA reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output.\n\nIf business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the long-term ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected; a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion.\n\n\u201cThis is a validator,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThis is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s gain was revised upward by 5,000 jobs, and May\u2019s by 13,000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July\u2019s increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track.\n\nThe Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the Libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest CNN/ORC poll. The Green Party's Jill Stein is at 5 percent in that same survey.\n\nA third-party candidate hasn't made it onto the stage since independent Ross Perot in 1992, but with both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton still struggling to unite their parties' bases while being dragged down by high disapproval ratings, there is a rare opening. And Johnson and Weld are aiming to fill that void.\n\n\"The idea that we should not be at those debates expressing what is a majority point of view in the country can only be laid at the door of the two-party monopoly, the duopoly, that has a stranglehold on power in Washington,\" Weld said. \"That's the Rs and the Ds, who sometimes seem to exist mainly for the express purpose of killing each other.\"\n\nJohnson stood by his characterization that Clinton was \"beholden\" to special interests and slammed her high fees for speaking to Wall Street groups. He argued there is a conflict of interest between the former secretary of state and her family's Clinton Foundation that \"smacks of pay-to-play.\"\n\nBut Weld had harsher words for Trump and the way the GOP candidate has reacted to criticism from the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq.\n\n\"He's a showman. He's a pied piper. He's the music man,\" Weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. \"More recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.\"\n\nJohnson dismissed the idea that they would play spoiler this fall, though.\n\n\"A wasted vote is voting for somebody that you don't believe in, and if we're going to continue to vote for the lesser of two evils, that's still evil,\" he told a questioner.\n\nJohnson did depart from typical libertarian orthodoxy in one instance. Previously, he has said that \"religious freedom, as a category\" was \"a black hole,\" and he said he wouldn't back any state religious freedom laws, such as ones that would protect people like wedding photographers or bakers from having to provide services for a gay wedding.\n\n\"I fear that under the guise of religious liberty, the LGBT community is being discriminated against,\" Johnson said. \"There can be a balance between the two, but I don't want to support discrimination in any form whatsoever.\"\n\nShetamia Taylor, a woman who was wounded in the Dallas police attack last month, asked Johnson about the Black Lives Matter movement. And the Libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement.\n\n\"My head's been in the sand on this. I think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up,\" Johnson said. \"This discrimination does exist.\"\n\nOn the subject of foreign policy, Johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes.\n\n\"We both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists,\" Johnson said. \"We're not isolationists. We're non-interventionists.

John McCain, and refocus his attacks on Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut hopes aren't high among Republican allies that Trump, 70, can make such a fundamental change at this point. And the Trump campaign publicly denies that any intervention is occurring at all.\n\n\"The reality is that I don't think anyone has any influence\" over Trump, a party source told NBC News.\n\nWithin the GOP, strategists are increasingly wondering at what point candidates will aggressively break with Trump or the party will divert resources from the presidential race to head off a collapse down the ticket.\n\n\"They don't want to, but he's forcing people's hands,\" GOP strategist Ryan Williams told NBC News.

Ted Cruz's father to the John F. Kennedy assassination and bringing up a federal judge's \"Mexican heritage\" as proof of bias.\n\n\"He lacks any kind of self-control,\" a GOP operative said. \"That's not my opinion. It's well demonstrated.\"\n\nAs Trump regularly reminds voters at rallies, however, he's also survived numerous so-called crises to reach his current position. But the general election isn't the primaries, and the timing and intensity of the current episode stand out.\n\nCNBC's John Harwood quoted an unnamed ally of campaign manager Paul Manafort on Tuesday night who called the mood \"suicidal\" and said Manafort was \"mailing it in\" after concluding that Trump was incapable of taking his advice.\n\nAnother source inside the campaign told NBC News that Harwood's account was \"all true\" and that the environment was \"way worse than people realize.\"\n\nLending particular urgency to this week's chaos is Trump's declining position in the polls against Clinton, who appears to be enjoying a major bump from last week's Democratic convention.\n\nSurveys indicate Clinton not only eliminating Trump's gains from his own convention, but also regaining the solid lead she held before FBI Director James Comey's criticism of her email practices depressed her support.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Clinton Campaign Actively Courting Republicans and Independents 1:42 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nThe most recent NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll puts him behind Clinton, 50 percent to 42 percent, with registered voters. A Fox News poll released Wednesday gave Clinton a 49 percent-to-39 percent lead.\n\nConvention bounces are sometimes fleeting, but once the race settles, there are few opportunities for candidates to make up ground, making Trump's missteps especially dangerous.\n\nThe Olympics begin this weekend, making it harder for Trump to win free media for much of the month. He could make it up by buying TV time, but the Clinton campaign and allied groups have reserved $98 million in ads through November \u2014 compared to less than $1 million on Trump's side.\n\nThe less likely Trump looks to win and the more toxic he looks with key voting groups, the more pressure Republican candidates in competitive races will face to denounce him.\"\n\n\"If Trump wants us to make a choice between our senators and representatives and him, it won't be him,\" another GOP operative in a swing state told NBC News.\n\nBut it's a delicate balance. If Republican candidates abandon Trump en masse, party operatives warn, depressed voters might stay home and leave federal and state candidates vulnerable to an electoral wipeout.\n\nWhile Republican candidates in some swing states have polled ahead of Trump by distancing themselves from his more controversial positions, they still need conservatives to show up and split their ticket to prevail.\n\nSo far, few high-profile Republicans running for office have repudiated Trump \u2014 even Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire is sticking by him, despite Trump's recent insults and Ayotte's longtime discomfort with his rhetoric.\n\nThe further Trump sinks, however, the harder it becomes to hold everyone together.\n\nA veteran GOP strategist suggested that the party should be able to win competitive House and Senate races with smart campaigns if Trump is trailing Clinton by 1 to 5 points. But if he starts to trail by double digits in polls \u2014 as he did in Fox's survey \u2014 it could create a panic as Republicans rush to disavow his candidacy in the hope that they might survive the coming disaster.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed More Republicans say they're with Hillary 4:42 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nPublicly, Trump and his top aides argue that talk of campaign troubles are overblown.\"We're great \u2014 it's a terrible week for Hillary Clinton,\" campaign spokesman Jason Miller told NBC News with a smile Wednesday.\n\nTrump, Miller said, has always been the anti-establishment candidate. His refusal to support Ryan against a pro-Trump primary opponent only reinforced that brand.\n\nAnd the campaign has had some good news mixed with the bad. This week, it raised an impressive $80 million in campaign contributions along with party allies \u2014 short of Clinton's $90 million, but a strong improvement for a campaign that built its fundraising operation from scratch after Trump largely self-funded during the primaries.\n\nSome also note that Clinton and other Democrats are vulnerable to negative stories.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Obama administration shipped $400 million in cash to Iran as part of a deal over sanctions at the same time Iran released Americans it had detained. The State Department said that the payment was unrelated and that the negotiations were kept separate, but Republicans accused it of paying a ransom.\n\nFact checkers have also pilloried Clinton this week for claiming that the FBI corroborated her previous defenses of her email practices.\n\nBut other campaign aides expressed concern that Trump failed to capitalize on Democratic weaknesses or emphasize his core strengths because he's too often distracted by side stories and settling scores within the GOP.\n\n\"We've got to get back to these basic issues that got him this far,\" former Trump adviser Barry Bennett told MSNBC.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Analysis: Will Trump's Children Be Part of the 'Intervention'? 0:48 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nTrump's afternoon speech Wednesday in Daytona Beach, Fla., demonstrated the difficulty.

In several interviews and speeches, he's made unsubstantiated claims that the election could be \"rigged\" against him, raising concerns that he might be laying the groundwork to delegitimize a Clinton presidency after a loss.\n\n\"Wouldn't that be embarrassing, to lose to Crooked Hillary Clinton?\" Trump said in Florida. \"That would be terrible.\"", "image": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_31/1651876/160803-donald-trump-rd-930p_df4bb75948fe1195673a74c4df432616.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump Pushes Republican Party to Its Breaking Point", "summary": "0:48 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogTrump's afternoon speech Wednesday in Daytona Beach, Fla., demonstrated the difficulty.\n\"The reality is that I don't think anyone has any influence\" over Trump, a party source told NBC News.\nAnother source inside the campaign told NBC News that Harwood's account was \"all true\" and that the environment was \"way worse than people realize.\nAnd the Trump campaign publicly denies that any intervention is occurring at all.\n\"They don't want to, but he's forcing people's hands,\" GOP strategist Ryan Williams told NBC News.", "source": "NBC News", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Katy Tur", "Benjy Sarlin", "Ali Vitali"], "keywords": ["campaign", "republicans", "clinton", "trump", "pushes", "point", "breaking", "donald", "trumps", "autoplay", "nbc", "party", "republican", "told"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-08-02 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/02/politics/donald-trump-paul-ryan-endorsements/index.html", "text": "(CNN) If Donald Trump wins in November, his most powerful Republican ally in Washington will be House Speaker Paul Ryan -- at least, that's the plan.\n\nBut the program has veered off course again and again, as the Republican nominee and the party's top elected official struggle to maintain a fragile d\u00e9tente amid recurring public squabbles.\n\nOn Thursday, less than 48 hours after Trump invited new trouble by revealing he would not endorse Ryan -- or fellow GOP stalwart Arizona Sen. John McCain -- in their coming primary contests, Ryan refused to rule out withdrawing his formal support for Trump.\n\n\"None of these things are ever blank checks,\" the speaker told Wisconsin radio host Jerry Bader.\n\nA few days earlier, Trump in withholding his endorsement for Ryan had called back on the darker days of pair's pained courtship.\n\n\"I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country,\" Trump told The Washington Post . \"We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there yet. I'm not quite there yet.\"\n\nSound familiar? It should. Back in May, Ryan when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if he was prepared to formally back Trump, said: \"I'm not there right now.\"\n\nNow, a little more than three months from Election Day, the two heaviest hitters in the Republican Party are at another crossroads.\n\nHere's a look back at their long, strange trip.\n\nRyan and Scott Walker\n\nMonths before Trump descended his gilded escalator into the primary muck, Ryan was talking up his fellow Wisconsinite, Gov. Scott Walker, as an early favorite to win the 2016 nomination.\n\n\"Scott's a good friend of mine,\" Ryan said . \"I think he's got a really good chance and I look forward to seeing how it goes for him.\"\n\nIt didn't go far. Like so many other would-be Republican contenders, Walker's campaign was quickly derailed by the Trump train.\n\nWalker left the race in September 2015 with this message : \"I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner\" -- a reference to Trump.\n\nThe Muslim ban and David Duke\n\nOn December 7, just hours after a poll was released showing Ted Cruz leap-frog Trump in Iowa, the businessman put out a surprise statement \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\n\nRyan condemned the proposal less than 24 hours later during a news conference on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"This is not conservatism,\" he said. \"Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islam terror are Muslims.\"\n\nThe criticism did little to hurt Trump with voters.\n\nAnd in late February, days before Super Tuesday, he again raised eyebrows by refusing to disavow former KKK leader David Duke during a Sunday interview with Tapper.\n\nThat Tuesday -- primary day -- Ryan brushed back Trump again, saying : \"If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" he added, \"this is the last time I need to speak out on this race.\"\n\nRyan's speech\n\nThree weeks later, on the day after Trump scored a major winner-take-all victory in Arizona, Ryan delivered what his office called a speech \"on the state of American politics.\"\n\nRyan's remarks were mostly read as a thinly veiled rebuke of Trump\n\n\"Looking around at what's taking place in politics today, it is easy to get disheartened,\" he said . \"How many of you find yourself just shaking your head at what you see from both sides?\"\n\nThe Wisconsin primary was less than two weeks away.\n\nTrump goes to Wisconsin\n\nThe front-runner landed in the Badger State and immediately proceeded to rip Walker, still popular there despite his weak turn on the national stage -- and a Ryan ally.\n\n\"Your governor came out, he was expected to win and we sent him packing like a little boy,\" Trump said during an interview with radio host Michael Koolidge , after Walker backed his rival, Ted Cruz.\n\nTrump kept up the attacks on Walker during a campaign stop in Janesville, Ryan's hometown -- a decision one Republican strategist in the state told CNN was like \"(poking) Ryan in the eye.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Speaker Ryan on Trump, GOP unity: \"we're not there yet\" Replay More Videos ...

I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from the presumptive nominee.\"\n\nTrump responded to the challenge later in the day by putting out a press release saying: \"I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.

Clinton now leads Trump by 5 points \u2014 43 percent to 38 percent \u2014 in the four-way race. This is a lead-reversal from last week, when Trump was beating the Democratic nominee by 2 points.

Overall, the number of voters who say they have a strongly favorable impression of the Democratic nominee is up 5 points \u2014 from 15 percent to 20 percent \u2014 since the question was asked two weeks ago.\n\nClinton's favorability among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters rose from 74 percent two weeks ago to 80 percent this week. Her unfavorable rating also dropped among Democrats from 24 percent to 19 percent.\n\nPresident Obama, who spoke at the convention last week, also got an increase in approval this week. His job approval rating is up 3 points \u2014 52 percent approve this week compared to 49 percent last week.\n\nAfter a contentious primary season, the convention offered Democrats the chance to unite as a party. Overall, most voters who watched or followed the convention did not view the Democratic Party more favorably as a result \u2014 27 percent viewed the Democratic Party more favorably as a result of the convention, but 35 percent viewed the party less favorably, and 37 percent said their opinion of the Democratic Party didn't change.\n\nAmong Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, half said they have a more favorable opinion of the Democratic Party as a result of the convention. Among Independent voters, 42 percent said they view the Democratic Party less favorably and 49 percent said the convention did not change their opinion. These results are similar to the favorability ratings we saw for the Republican Party last week following the GOP convention.\n\nOverall, four in 10 voters said they were more interested in this year's Democratic National Convention compared to previous years. Among Democrats, 58 percent said they were more interested in this year's convention than in prior years. Roughly the same number of Republicans said that about the GOP convention last week. Among Independents, 46 percent said they had about the same level of interest this year as in previous years and 34 percent said they were less interested this year.\n\nA strong Democratic convention combined with Trump's troubles over the past few days surrounding his tweets toward the Khan family and comments about Russia produced a very good bounce for Clinton.

It\u2019s the third victory in a row for voting rights and sets up more wins before Nov. 8.\n\nJuly may be the month that voter suppression died.\n\nIn the latest of a string of shocking judicial decisions, a federal appeals court Friday struck down North Carolina\u2019s voting restrictions, some of the strictest in the nation. Today\u2019s action comes after the normally conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Texas\u2019s Voter ID laws, and a federal district court placed an injunction against Wisconsin\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory,\u201d Dale Ho, the ACLU lawyer who argued the case in North Carolina, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe tide is turning.\u201d\n\nIt could also swing the presidential election. As we reported last February, new voting restrictions were set to block over 1.3 million voters in four swing states\u2014Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014 mostly by eliminating early voting periods and requiring specific forms of identification.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s 2016 law alone affected more than 1.2 million people: 900,000 people utilized early voting in 2012, 130,000 used same-day registration in 2008, and, surprisingly, more than 200,000 registered voters don\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses. As of today, those votes are back in play.\n\nBy way of comparison, Barack Obama won the state by 15,000 votes in 2008, and Mitt Romney won by 117,000 in 2012.\n\nBut the Fourth Circuit didn\u2019t just strike down North Carolina\u2019s new rules. The three-judge panel wrote an opinion filled with fiery rhetoric that condemned the state legislature for acting with discriminatory intent. It noted that \u201cafter years of preclearance and expansion of voting access, by 2013 African American registration and turnout rates had finally reached near-parity with white registration and turnout rates. African Americans were poised to act as a major electoral force.\u201d\n\nBut that year, after the Supreme Court ruled that part of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, the state \u201crequested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans\u2026 Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist.\u201d\n\nThese are unusually strong words, both in ordinary language and in legalese. It\u2019s not just that North Carolina\u2019s law happens to affect communities of color\u2014the Court found that it was intended to do so all along.\n\nThat\u2019s different from the Fifth Circuit\u2019s finding that Texas\u2019s Voter ID law had a disparate impact on minority communities. It\u2019s actually calling out North Carolina for racial discrimination.\n\nDoes that mean that North Carolina\u2019s legislators are racist? Not quite.\n\n\u201cDiscriminatory intent means singling out a group on the basis of race and trying to disadvantage them on that basis,\u201d Ho explained. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you hate black voters, or don\u2019t like how black voters vote. If you\u2019re targeting them, that is discrimination.\u201d\n\nThat, the appeals court found, is exactly what North Carolina did. Inventing a voter fraud crisis that didn\u2019t exist, the state \u201crequired in-person voters to show certain photo IDs, beginning in 2016, which African Americans disproportionately lacked, and eliminated or reduced registration and voting access tools that African Americans disproportionately used.\u201d\n\nAll this correlation, the court ruled, couldn\u2019t be an accident. There was no smoking gun\u2014no careless comment about disenfranchising black voters\u2014but the way the gun was loaded, aimed, and fired left no doubt about the law\u2019s purpose.\n\n\u201cThe only clear factor linking these various \u2018reforms\u2019 is their impact on African American voters,\u201d the court held. \u201cThe record thus makes obvious that the \u2018problem\u2019 the majority in the General Assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but as a longtime Trump-watcher, that\u2019s how it came off to me.\n\nBut think about the media coverage for a minute. To believe that the Republican nominee was dead serious in urging an adversary of the United States to commit or complete an act of espionage against his Democratic opponent is to believe that Trump is clinically insane.\n\nAnd I do think many journalists and commentators view him as a bit unhinged. That\u2019s why this makes sense to them. They think Trump is so off the wall that it seems perfectly plausible.\n\nOthers, I believe, don\u2019t believe Trump really meant it, but they think he stepped in it with the remarks and are happy to bash him over it.\n\nLook, Trump says a lot of incendiary things. His comments on Mexicans and Muslims and the like get him into trouble and are more than fair game for criticism. But this one is different.\n\n\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said. He added that the press would love that.\n\nTrump is a master, of course, of saying things that are just far enough over the line that he drives a story for days. In this case, it means keeping a focus on the 33,000 emails that Clinton deleted from her private server as pundits and politicians debate whether he crossed a line\u2014siphoning covering from the convention speeches by President Obama, Vice President Biden, Bill Clinton and others.\n\nTrump now says he was being sarcastic and we don\u2019t even know whether the Russians are behind the hacking.\n\nWhat\u2019s striking about the coverage is that it barely acknowledges that this could be an open question:\n\nThe New York Times headline: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Appeal to Russia Shocks Foreign Policy Experts\u201d:\n\n\u201cThere is simply no precedent for this: A presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the election on his behalf.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post lead: \u201cRepublican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the U.S. presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton \u2014 an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politics.\"\n\nPolitico\u2019s lead: \"Donald Trump's call on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails has shocked, flabbergasted and appalled lawmakers and national security experts across the political spectrum, with one saying it was \u2018tantamount to treason.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it possible that Trump was being sarcastic? That he was joking?\u201d CNN\u2019s Carol Costello asked her panel. The response was no, and even if he was, it wasn\u2019t funny.\n\nThis is why professional politicians avoid sarcasm, to avoid uttering words that create an uproar.

We all saw something on Thursday night that, in over 200 years of American existence, no one had ever seen before: a woman accept a major-party nomination for the presidency. That\u2019s an incredible achievement, attained by the nominee through years of struggle, setbacks, and steady forward motion. The magnitude of Hillary Clinton\u2019s accomplishment guarantees her a spot in the history books, and those of us who witnessed her make that history won\u2019t soon forget the impression it left.\n\nThe weird counterpoint to the Democrats\u2019 elevation of a candidate who represents continued social progress is, of course, the Republicans\u2019 nomination of Donald Trump. The Democratic convention was intended to serve both as a response to the fear and disunity offered by Trumpism, and a push to steal from the Republicans all the themes and campaign messages Trumpism eschews: optimism, patriotism, and a sense of shared purpose. Clinton\u2019s speech accepting the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination was the capstone of that effort, serving as a call to unity, offering an outstretched hand to those alienated by Trump, and sketching out an optimistic vision of America\u2019s future.\n\nHillary\u2019s provocations of Trump were relentless. She said he \u201cwants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other.\u201d She quipped that \u201che\u2019s taken the Republican Party a long way: from \u2018Morning in America\u2019 to \u2018Midnight in America.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s megalomaniacal declaration that \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d was slung around his neck as Clinton framed it as fundamentally alien to the American tradition. \u201cHe\u2019s forgetting every last one of us,\u201d she said. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t say: \u2018I alone can fix it.\u2019 We say: \u2018We\u2019ll fix it together.\u2019\u201d In tackling Trump\u2019s fitness for the office, Clinton made enthusiastic use of The Zinger. \u201cImagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d The obvious intent behind all this was to goad Trump into responding and validating the attack.

With the Vermont senator watching from the arena, Clinton told his supporters: \"I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama congratulated Clinton at the conclusion of her speech.\n\n\"Great speech,\" he tweeted. \"She's tested. She's ready. She never quits.

It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.\"\n\nTurning to national security, Clinton warned that a president has to make decisions about war and peace, life and death.\n\n\"Ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief?

Her prime-time televised address is especially crucial because she has not so far generated the kind of passion among her supporters that Trump has garnered from his backers by channeling anger about the direction of the country.\n\nShe spoke of her wholesome middle class upbringing and said her family were builders of the American dream and not people \"with their name on big buildings\" -- another dig at Trump.\n\nClinton took pains to reach out to white blue-collar workers, many of whom have been left behind by economic globalization and technological change and have been attracted by Trump's anti-elite message.\n\n\"Right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do,\" she said, and admitted that politicians had not done a good enough job of showing they understand.\n\nOne of the major themes of the Democratic convention has been an attempt to reintroduce one of the most famous women in the world to the American people. And she admitted that if many Americans knew little of the woman behind the image, it may be her fault.\n\n\"The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton also indicated she understood the need to reassure Americans shaken by a violent summer at home and an epidemic of terror attacks in Europe and the US. While Clinton and Obama have argued that ISIS is on the run, the economy is on the upswing, and Americans are safer than they have been in years, they are struggling to counter the dark image that Trump has painted of a nation in decline, chaos and disorder that resonates with many voters.\n\nNational security threats\n\nAmid charges by Republicans that the optimistic mood of the Democratic convention has ignored the threat from ISIS and terrorism, Clinton was specific about the global national security threats that loom -- though she didn't use the term Islamic terrorism as the GOP repeatedly has called for.\n\n\"Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face,\" Clinton said. \"From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice to Paris and Brussels. From San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies who must be defeated. No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance -- looking for steady leadership.\"\n\nFollowing a spate of killings by police of African-American youths and massacres of police officers, Clinton laid out a firm stance on gun control, vowing that America should not have a president in the \"pocket\" of the gun lobby.\n\n\"I'm not here to take away your guns,\" she said. \"I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.\"\n\nAhead of her speech, retired four star General John Allen, the former head of US and international forces in Afghanistan, delivered a powerful address in which he told delegates that Clinton would be \"exactly the Commander-in-Chief America needs.\"\n\n'America will continue to lead'\n\n\"With her as our Commander-in-Chief, America will continue to lead this volatile world. We will oppose and resist tyranny and we will defeat evil. America will defeat ISIS and protect the homeland,\" said Allen, who was surrounded on stage by 37 military veterans.\n\nClinton delivered her speech at the end of a largely successful convention, which helped mend the party after her divisive primary against Sanders. The mood on the convention floor Thursday was festive and upbeat \u2014 in contrast to the discontent that festered on the opening night Monday when die-hard Sanders fans loudly make their disappointment known.\n\nSamantha Herring of Walton County, Florida, was a Sanders supporter but has decided this week to work hard to elect Clinton.\n\n\"Is it hard? Yes. I loved Bernie, but that's why I have to vote for Hillary,\" said Herring, who made signs reading \"He has my heart, but she has my vote.\"", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160727234814-45-dnc-gallery-0727-super-tease.jpg", "title": "How Hillary Clinton defined her historic moment", "summary": "\"U.S. Sen.

(Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nIn an election season in which restive voters of all stripes are frustrated with the status quo, it fell to President Obama on Wednesday to argue for staying the course by giving Democrats a third term in the White House \u2014 and that Hillary Clinton is the right person to keep moving the nation forward.\n\nHaving spent the first two nights of the Democratic National Convention trying to unify the party behind Clinton, a procession of leading party figures made a sharp pivot to GOP nominee Donald Trump. Over the course of the evening, they questioned his character, his judgment, his business acumen \u2014 even his sanity.\n\nObama offered an American ideal against that bill of particulars against Trump: \u201cOur power doesn\u2019t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order.

Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) as the Democratic vice-presidential pick. Noting that his eldest child is a Marine who deployed to Europe on Monday, Kaine said: \u201cI trust Hillary Clinton with our son\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nIt was the first night in which the Democratic speakers focused heavily on the themes of national security and foreign policy \u2014 and their most concerted effort to undermine Trump on issues where he has relentlessly pummeled Obama and Clinton.\n\nVice President Biden described Trump as \u201ca man who confuses bluster with strength\u201d and someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue about the middle class.\u201d\n\n[Joe Biden delivered the Donald Trump takedown nobody else could]\n\nA president of resurgent popularity, Obama offered a counterpoint to the near-apocalyptic portrait of the country on display during last week\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump accepted his party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThe America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous,\u201d Obama said.\n\nPresident Obama's speech electrified the crowd in Philadelphia on July 28, leaving some with chills and others in tears. (Alice Li,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nHe nodded toward the country\u2019s worries and the trauma of recent tragedies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got more work to do,\u201d the president said. \u201cMore work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a decent retirement; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty or a world-class education; for everyone who hasn\u2019t yet felt the progress of these past seven-and-a-half years.\u201d\n\nBut Obama, echoing some of the upbeat themes that first lady Michelle Obama sounded on the convention\u2019s opening night, gave an address focused on progress, both economic and social, and \u201ca younger generation full of energy and new ideas, unconstrained by what is, and ready to seize what ought to be.\u201d\n\nClinton took the stage unannounced at the end of the Obama\u2019s remarks, and the two engaged in a prolonged embrace before walking around arm in arm waving to a boisterous crowd.\n\nAll of it amounted to a reversal of the two parties\u2019 traditional orientations. Republicans typically claim the upbeat mantra of Ronald Reagan, who famously talked of the United States as a \u201cshining city upon a hill,\u201d echoing the words of Puritan John Winthrop\u2019s famous 1630 sermon, which paraphrased Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount.\n\nThe Democrats, on the other hand, often have come across as the party more focused on the nation\u2019s woes and flaws \u2014 or as then-U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick put it contemptuously at the 1984 GOP convention, the \u201cblame America first crowd.\u201d\n\nMidway through Wednesday evening\u2019s speeches, Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary in the George W. Bush White House, tweeted: \u201cWatching Democrats talk about America the way Republican candidates used to talk about America.\u201d\n\nFor any party to hold the White House for three consecutive terms is a difficult feat, even in rosy times.\n\nDemocrats have not done so since before World War II, and only twice since 1828, at the dawn of the modern two-party system. The GOP has done it four times, most recently when Vice President George H.W. Bush won the 1988 election to succeed Reagan.\n\nBut it is all the more of a challenge when the vast majority of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nThe latest Real Clear Politics average of polls shows that the share of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track is nearly 46 percentage points greater than those who think it is on a favorable course.\n\nThat has fueled the anti-establishment mood that delivered the GOP nomination to Trump and made Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) a formidable challenger to Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAs the evening wore on, scattered anti-\u201cTPP\u201d signs popped up around the arena, signaling opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending trade deal championed by Obama but opposed by most congressional Democrats and labor unions.\n\nKaine has supported the deal in the past but is expected to modify his position to conform with that of Clinton, who as secretary of state called it the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade deals but is now opposed.\n\nSpeeches and videos Wednesday aimed to reinforce Clinton\u2019s governing credentials, particularly on national security. This followed Democrats\u2019 efforts to unify the party on Monday and both humanize and attest to their nominee\u2019s character on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats were given fresh fodder Wednesday for their argument that Trump is unprepared and temperamentally unsuited to be president.\n\nAt a news conference in Florida, Trump pleaded directly with the Russian government to meddle in the U.S. campaign by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from Clinton \u2014 a development that alarmed not only Democrats but also many Republican leaders and foreign policy experts.\n\n[Trump invites Russia to meddle in the U.S. presidential race]\n\nAmong those called upon to draw contrasts between Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s foreign policy credentials was retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, one of several military leaders in the spotlight at the convention.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump calls himself the \u2018law-and-order candidate,\u2019 but he\u2019ll violate international law,\u201d Hutson said. \u201cIn his words, he endorses torture \u2018at a minimum.\u2019 He\u2019ll order our troops to commit war crimes like killing civilians. . . . This morning, he personally invited Russia to hack us. That\u2019s not law and order. That\u2019s criminal intent.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus on Wednesday looked past the Obama era and expressed their faith in Clinton as their standard-bearer and champion. But mostly they delivered a vehement denunciation of Trump, saying he has no plan to lift African Americans.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) said Trump is simply \u201cthe least-qualified person to ever seek the presidency.\u201d He added a bit of wordplay, saying Clinton had served as secretary of state while Trump is a \u201csecretary of hate.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks to the convention, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) chided Trump as \u201ca hateful con man\u201d but also blamed his Republican counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), for \u201csetting the stage\u201d for Trump.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a onetime Republican turned independent, also urged a vote for Clinton, making a special appeal to his fellow independents.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless and radical choice, and we can\u2019t afford to make that choice,\u201d Bloomberg said, calling Trump a \u201cdangerous demagogue.\u201d\n\nThe former New York mayor is also a leading voice for tougher gun laws, a cause that was featured in a segment of Wednesday night\u2019s program. It included an emotional speech by Christine Leinonen, the mother of Christopher Leinonen, who was killed in the massacre last month at an Orlando nightclub.\n\nThe presentation also featured speakers with connections to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 and at a church in Charleston, S.C., last year.\n\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (Ariz.), who was shot in Tucson in 2011, also appeared alongside her husband, Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and Navy captain. The two have made it their mission to enact additional gun control measures.\n\n\u201cWe have important work ahead of us, work that will determine the future of our country,\u201d said Giffords, who argued for Clinton\u2019s candidacy, saying, \u201cStrong women get things done.\u201d\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race after a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, noted that he had competed against Clinton and worked with Kaine when the vice-presidential nominee was governor of Virginia.\n\n\u201cI am here to tell you that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are as tough as they come,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cThey never give up. They never give in.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley took aim at Trump, saying he has been \u201ca bully his whole life.\u201d\n\nKaine\u2019s pick as Clinton\u2019s running mate drew praise from many quarters, but the former Virginia governor faces a challenge in convincing some liberal groups that he will champion their issues. Longtime watchers of Virginia politics say the question during much of Kaine\u2019s career there has been whether he is too liberal for the state.\n\n\u201cI think progressives are looking for him not only to talk about progressive issues, but to talk about them with authenticity and sincerity,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which bills itself as representative of the \u201cWarren wing\u201d of the Democratic Party, a reference to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).\n\n\u201cHe has a real chance to introduce himself to the Democratic Party and electorate at large,\u201d Taylor said of Kaine.\n\nSome Sanders supporters had threatened in recent days to walk out of the hall or otherwise show their displeasure with Clinton\u2019s pick of Kaine, a former Richmond mayor, Virginia governor and chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Only a smattering of disapproval could be heard in the hall.\n\nIn his address to the convention, Kaine showed that he is warming up to the running mate\u2019s traditional role as the presidential nominee\u2019s attack dog.\n\nHe delighted the crowd with his mocking impersonation of Trump, focusing on his verbal tic of saying \u201cBelieve me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth. Not one word,\u201d Kaine said, setting off the delegates in a chant of \u201cNot one word.\u201d\n\nIsaac Stanley-Becker contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/07/28/National-Politics/Images/dncWednesday_2061469677691.jpg", "title": "Obama rips Trump in forceful endorsement of Clinton: \u2018She will finish the job\u2019", "summary": "July 27, 2016 President Obama embraces Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the end of the third day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\nFrom President Obama's passionate endorsement of Hillary Clinton to Tim Kaine\u2019s Donald Trump impression, here\u2019s what happened on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention.\n(Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)From President Obama's passionate endorsement of Hillary Clinton to Tim Kaine\u2019s Donald Trump impression, here\u2019s what happened on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention.\n\u201cI am here to tell you that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are as tough as they come,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\nCaption Follow along as Post photographers document the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Karen Tumulty Is A National Political Correspondent For The Washington Post", "John Wagner Is A National Political Reporter Covering The White House"], "keywords": ["party", "kaine", "finish", "clinton", "trump", "forceful", "convention", "hillary", "rips", "job", "endorsement", "president", "democratic", "national", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-27 00:00:00", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/07/27/analysis-folksy-impeached-president-endorses-scandalplagued-disliked-wife-n2198515", "text": "PHILADELPHIA - It was fine.\n\n\n\nThe DNC's Tuesday agenda featured exactly one major primetime headliner: Former President Bill Clinton, who set out to build an emotionally-rooted case on behalf of his wife, whom their party had nominated for the presidency hours earlier. In 2012, I remember sitting in the arena rafters in Charlotte, watching with helpless frustration and dismay as our 42nd president articulated the most compelling (if fact-challenged) argument for Barack Obama's re-election that I'd seen to date. He was masterful, weaving a plausible-sounding story in which Republicans were ridiculed as howling partisans, blinded by resentful and unrealistic expectations of his tale's heroic protagonist. He went full policy wonk at times, somehow pulling it off. He made people believe that Obama and company were the adults trying to fix awful inherited problems, while the GOP shrieked in nihilistic protest. I recall the sinking, intuitive feeling that the race -- which was absolutely losable for Obama at that point -- had shifted with one speech. I awarded him a B+ in my postgame analysis, which was wishful thinking. The thrust of Clinton's argument went largely unrefuted for weeks, with the glorious and fleeting exception of that first presidential debate in Denver. Bill Clinton really did help Obama win. Period. And Romney knew it, as evidenced by this memorable one-liner from his pre-election Alfred E. Smith dinner comedy routine. The best jokes have at least a kernel of truth to them:\n\n\"Campaigns can be grueling, exhausting. President Obama and I are each very lucky to have one person who is always in our corner, someone who we can lean on, and someone who is a comforting presence, without whom we wouldn't be able to go another day. I have my beautiful wife, Ann; he has Bill Clinton.\"\n\nTonight, Bill Clinton strode into the spotlight once again, this time to work his magic on behalf of his wife. He did well, I think, but didn't alter the trajectory of the race. That's not to say that Hillary won't get a boost out of Philadelphia; she very probably will, as Trump did after Cleveland. But that was not a lightning strike address. It wasn't even the best speech of the first half of the convention. Still, it was pretty clear what he was trying to do. Before the big address, Megyn Kelly asked me if I thought Bill would seek to rescue Hillary's drowning honesty numbers, which are deservedly and truly awful. My reply:\n\n.@guypbenson: \u201c...can [@billclinton] do anything to help rehabilitate her trustworthiness numbers? I don\u2019t think he can.\u201d #KellyFile \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) July 27, 2016\n\nHe didn't really even try. Instead, he set to work chipping away at her personal favorability gap, which is also a serious problem:\n\nReality check: Hillary Clinton's unfavorable ratings -- CNN 55%, Gallup 57%, CBS 56%. \u2014 Stuart Rothenberg (@StuPolitics) July 27, 2016\n\nClinton painted a portrait of a technocratic workhorse (committees! task forces!) who genuinely cares about people, and has channeled those sentiments into a lifetime of tireless public service. That was the whole point of his at times meandering reminiscences about their early life together. And putting a human face on a woman seen by many as power-hungry and calculating is precisely why he devoted quite a lot of time to describing Hillary as a mother. (I don't think talking about Hillary's water breaking was simply tossed in casually). Along the same lines, Chelsea will undoubtedly lay the \"grandma\" color on thick on Thursday night. The former president traced his timeline up into the present day -- skipping certain unhelpful bits, like the year 1998 -- and adorning Hillary's tenure at the State Department with the most impressive-sounding \"achievement\" language he could summon. His only partisan shots were a brief jab about mocking the disabled, and the suggestion that everything at the RNC last week was \"made up.\" In fairness, he is something of an expert on the subject of making things up. He didn't need to go uber-partisan, as he did four years ago, because his objectives were different this time. Bill Clinton can read a poll as well as anyone else; he knows that most people already dislike Donald Trump. This was about boosting Hillary's very slight and narrowing favorability advantage, not trying to drive Trump's stratospheric unfavorability numbers any higher. His wife, he said, is serious and committed. The real deal. Believe him, he's witnessed it for decades firsthand.\n\nWas the speech welcomed rapturously in the hall? Yes. They love him here. Did it play well on television? I bet it did. It helped her. Was it a game-changing performance that's likely to permanently alter people's perceptions of Hillary Clinton? I doubt it. She is still the same flawed, unlikable, dishonest, ethically-unfit candidate she was this morning. And if rumors and vows are to be believed, more embarrassments and ethical imbroglios may lie ahead for her. Bill Clinton hasn't lost his touch as a marvelous political communicator, but there's only so much he could work with here. His effort was admirable and solid nonetheless. But I suspect it didn't deliver the memorable political juice that his 2012 outing did.\n\n\n\nOnward, to day three.", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/208/2016-07-27T022007Z_1_LYNXNPEC6Q046_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "title": "Analysis: Folksy, Impeached President Endorses Scandal-Plagued, Disliked Wife", "summary": "Bill Clinton can read a poll as well as anyone else; he knows that most people already dislike Donald Trump.\n\"Tonight, Bill Clinton strode into the spotlight once again, this time to work his magic on behalf of his wife.\nWas it a game-changing performance that's likely to permanently alter people's perceptions of Hillary Clinton?\nBill Clinton hasn't lost his touch as a marvelous political communicator, but there's only so much he could work with here.\nI have my beautiful wife, Ann; he has Bill Clinton.", "source": "Townhall", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": ["Guy Benson", "Christine Rousselle", "Katie Pavlich", "Ap News"], "keywords": ["bill", "hillarys", "wife", "folksy", "trying", "endorses", "analysis", "work", "hillary", "clinton", "impeached", "president", "disliked", "didnt", "scandalplagued", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-26 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-26/bill-clinton-faces-a-party-conflicted-on-both-his-wife-legacy", "text": "Bill Clinton on Tuesday addressed a Democratic Party that remains divided over not only his wife\u2019s candidacy but his own legacy as president. During a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention, the former president sought to humanize his wife by describing her as a loving mother and wife whose service to others started long before she walked the halls of power in Washington.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life,\u201d Clinton said in Philadelphia. \u201cThis woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is.\u201d\n\nDubbed the \u201csecretary of explaining stuff\u201d for his well-received speech endorsing President Barack Obama in 2012, Clinton faced a much different environment when he entered the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, where supporters of Bernie Sanders have booed and chanted against Hillary Clinton. The former president\u2019s speech was greeted with cheers and applause as he laid out the chronology of his relationship with the woman he met at Yale Law School 45 years ago.\n\nClinton, who aides say wrote his speech himself, emphasized the former first lady\u2019s role as a wife, mother and advocate as well as a politician. Many of the policies he embraced as president have come under withering criticism from his party\u2019s base -- particularly Bernie Sanders\u2019s supporters -- and Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from her husband\u2019s legacy on trade, criminal justice, financial regulation and welfare.\n\n\"He still has a visceral connection with a lot of people. Beyond the Obama coalition, I think he really reaches people that the Democratic Party has struggled to get since 2000,\" said Teege Mettille, a delegate from Ashland, Wisconsin.\n\n\u2018Change-Maker\u2019\n\nUsing the term \"change-maker\" multiple times to describe his wife, the former president sought to counter criticism, voiced by Sanders during the primary campaign, that she is a member of the political establishment who will defend the status quo. The 69-year-old Clinton, who built his political career on moving Democrats toward the center and now is the elder statesman of a party surging toward the left, steered clear of discussing his own presidential legacy.\n\nDuring the primary campaign, Sanders regularly whipped up the crowd at his rallies with broadsides against policies that Bill Clinton championed two decades ago. Decrying \u201cestablishment politics\u201d and \u201cestablishment economics\u201d without naming the former president, Sanders criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton pushed to ratification in 1993 and mass incarceration resulting from the 1994 crime bill. He has also slammed the welfare legislation Clinton championed in 1996 as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and criticized the deregulation of the financial industry in the 1990s.\n\nIn seeking to boost his wife\u2019s campaign, the former president has struggled to strike a balance between defending his record and embracing the insurgent wing of today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018Well, we need a change. She\u2019s been around a long time,\u2019\" Clinton said in his speech. \"She sure has. And she sure has been worth every single year she\u2019s put into making people\u2019s lives better.\u201d\n\nWhen protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement interrupted his campaign speech in April, Clinton engaged in a shouting match with them as he tried to defend the crime bill. The spectacle took attention away from his wife\u2019s campaign and his defense of the bill conflicted with Hillary Clinton\u2019s decision to apologize for the impact it has had on minority communities.\n\nThe former president has also attacked Sanders for promising an unattainable political revolution, and accused his supporters -- so-called \u201cBernie Bros\u201d -- of engaging in sexism and abuse online in February.\n\nLimited Role\n\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Clinton, who has had a limited role in his wife\u2019s campaign since those early stumbles, has done little to smooth over things with Sanders supporters. He drew rebukes from Democrats and Republicans last month after privately meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac just days before Hillary Clinton was cleared in an FBI investigation into her handling of classified information as secretary of State.\n\nIn Philadelphia, where hundreds of Sanders supporters have taken to the streets to chant \u201clock her up!\u201d and \u201cNever Hillary,\u201d Bill Clinton sought to persuade doubters who say his wife is neither honest nor trustworthy. He said critics had painted a \u201ccartoon\u201d image of Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cShe is constantly referred to as the least-known best person in America, and I think you will get to hear from him that sense of what attracted him to her in the first place,\u201d John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, said Tuesday morning at a Bloomberg Politics breakfast in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen Obama faced questions over his handling of the economy in 2012, Clinton used his 50-minute speech at the Democratic convention to lay out a statistics-laden economic case for Obama\u2019s re-election.

But he now is virtually their only hope for easing the tensions at the Philadelphia convention, where delegates are poised to crown Clinton as the party\u2019s presidential nominee on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process.

Elizabeth Warren in appealing to the left wing of the party to unite behind Clinton. First lady Michelle Obama, too, worked to ease the tensions in the convention hall in an earlier speech that at times seemed to rally the divided crowd.\n\n\u201cAmerica faces a choice,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because our choice is Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m with Hillary.\u201d\n\nShe called Trump a \"man who inherited a fortune from his father\u201d and cares only for himself.\n\n\"Donald Trump has no real plans for jobs, for college kids, for seniors. No plans to make anything great for anyone except rich guys like Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe liberal icon, who spoke right before Sanders, still faced small pockets of unrest as she delivered a full-throated Clinton endorsement, with some people chanting \u201cwe trusted you\u201d over her remarks. But Warren called Clinton \u201ca woman who fights for all of us.\u201d\n\nTogether, the two speakers had an opportunity to tamp down the unrest among liberal activists, many of whom not only backed Sanders during the turbulent primary battle but wanted to either see Warren step into the ring or be tapped for running mate. Whether their words can now help calm the storm inside and outside the convention hall remains to be seen.\n\nSanders\u2019 speech could help. \u201cIt was a very unifying message, the essence of unity,\u201d Kit Andrews, a Vermont alternate delegate and Sanders supporter, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a long process to bring people together. He has always said that.\u201d\n\nSanders and Warren, along with Michelle Obama and Clinton booster New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, addressed the convention at the close of a noisy and boisterous Monday session.

Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who was presiding, scolded the protesters as they interrupted at the very mention of Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe are all Democrats, and we need to act like it,\u201d she said.\n\nMichelle Obama, speaking hours and countless disruptions later, seemed to draw a more positive response, eliciting applause during her lines on Clinton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with her,\u201d Obama declared, asking Democrats to do for the former secretary of state what they did for her husband \u2013 and turn out to the polls.\n\n\u201cBetween now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago. \u2026 We need to get out every vote!\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nThe audience remained visibly divided during her remarks, however, with one man being shushed for saying, \u201cWe love you, Michelle.\u201d\n\nObama didn't leave the stage without taking a veiled shot at Trump. She warned that the White House couldn't be in the hands of someone with a \"thin skin or tendency to lash out or someone who tells voters the country could be great again.\n\nBooker, who had been considered for running mate before the job went to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, earlier blasted Republican nominee Donald Trump while touting Clinton\u2019s support for a \u201cfair wage\u201d and \u201cdebt-free college\u201d \u2013 and trying to connect her ideals to Sanders\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt represents the best of our values, the best of our history and the best of our party -- all of our shared ideas and values together,\u201d Booker said.\n\nSeveral celebrities including comedian Sarah Silverman and actress Eva Longoria also rallied to Clinton\u2019s defense \u2013 with Silverman even taking on the Sanders crowd, saying, \u201cBernie or bust people, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d\n\nEven before the disruptions in the arena, the convention had kicked off Monday under a cloud of controversy -- after the leak of emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias inside the DNC forced the resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nShe had been expected to open the convention anyway, but after facing continued backlash from Sanders supporters Monday morning was replaced in that role by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.\n\nAnti-Clinton sentiment, however, continued to run high inside and outside the convention site, as pro-Sanders and other demonstrators marched from Camden to downtown Philadelphia and ultimately toward the arena \u2013 all while the convention was gaveling in. Inside the hall, Sanders supporters jeered Democratic officials trying to move the proceedings along.\n\nThe developments added up to a far more chaotic start than at the Republicans\u2019 convention a week ago in Cleveland.

(Thomas Johnson,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nThe announcement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz's planned resignation as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee was sudden, shaking up an otherwise sleepy Sunday afternoon in which most of the political world was focused on making its way to Philadelphia for the party's quadrennial convention.\n\nBut, if her departure was abrupt \u2014 Wasserman Schultz will resign her post when the Democratic National Convention ends on Thursday night \u2014 the fall that led to the end was anything but. Wasserman Schultz's tenure at the head of the DNC has been rocky almost since the moment she took over the job in 2011.\n\nInterviews with a variety of pro- and anti-Wasserman Schultz Democrats \u2014 and there are plenty of both \u2014 suggest that the Florida House member's problems were both personal and structural, and that she retains a relatively bright future even if this chapter of her political life left much to be desired.\n\n[Here are the latest, most damaging things in the DNC\u2019s leaked emails]\n\nWhere to start when it comes to the \"why\" behind Wasserman Schultz's struggles depends on who you believe is to blame for them.\n\nDNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and Vice President Biden (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nSeveral people I talked to put the blame \u2014 or at least a large portion of it \u2014 on President Obama and his inner circle of political advisers who never cared about the DNC in any meaningful way and, as a result, left Wasserman Schultz to wither on the vine as they worked around her time and again.\n\n\"Obama and team never accepted the DNC or cared very much about it, and it showed,\" said one senior Democratic strategist granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"Obama was not into party building, or party anything. He never integrated his political operation into the DNC so she was in a very tough position always.\"\n\nFrom the start, Obama was never a big \"party\" guy. He explicitly ran against the party infrastructure and elites in 2008 \u2014 Hillary Clinton was their candidate \u2014 and once he got into office was openly disdainful of many of the traditional apparatus of the party.\n\nObama installed his loyal ally Tim Kaine \u2014 name ring a bell? \u2014 as the DNC chair. But, once Kaine decided to run for an open Virginia Senate seat in 2011, it was clear to anyone paying attention that the next DNC chair wouldn't be a member of the Obama inner circle as he began positioning himself for his reelection bid.\n\nEnter Wasserman Schultz, a Jewish woman from Florida who had a reputation as a dogged fundraiser and willing attack dog on TV. For what Obama imagined that job to be, she was a natural fit.\n\n\"She wasn't anyone's first choice for chair,\" a veteran Democratic operative said. \"But I think most people thought she'd be fine.\"\n\n[Schedule: Who will speak in Philadelphia during the 2016 Democratic National Convention]\n\nThe counter to that story line is that Wasserman Schultz, from the jump, seemed dead set on using the perch to promote her own political interests rather than put what was best for Obama first.\n\nEven some of Wasserman Schultz's harshest critics acknowledge that part of that problem was structural: She was in elected office while also serving as the party chair. She was looking to move up the ladder in House leadership and saw the DNC job as a way to do that. Period.\n\nShe was far from the only elected official who has struggled to balance the demands of the party chair job with more provincial interests. \"It wasn't great with [then Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd] or [then Philadelphia Mayor Ed] Rendell, and it wasn't great with her,\" said one leading Democratic consultant. \"There are always concerns about whose agenda gets put first, tensions between official duties (particularly votes) and political party duties.\"\n\nBut, Wasserman Schultz's emphasis on her own political future \u2014 and the need to make sure she was front and center when it came to media attention and interviews \u2014 rubbed lots and lots of people the wrong way.\n\n\"She ignored infrastructure, instead focusing on why she wasn't getting more media hits,\" noted a longtime Democratic strategist familiar with the inner workings of the party committee. \"\n\n\"Fundraising was anemic.\"\n\nWhat everyone agrees on is that Wasserman Schultz suffered a series of self-inflicted wounds as chair. There was the time she broke with the White House about deporting children detained at the border. The time she said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had given women \"the back of his hand.\" Story after story about how she was feathering her own political nest first and then worrying about Obama and the broader party second \u2014 or not at all. How she found herself on the wrong side of Bernie Sanders and the party's liberal base.\n\nOn and on it went. For much of the past two years, rumors of Wasserman Schultz's demise came across the transom with remarkable regularity. And yet, she persevered \u2014 occasionally via means that left made her detractors even more convinced that she needed to go.\n\nWhat her increasingly large enemies list could never find was a spark that could set all of the tinder they had gathered aflame. That long-awaited moment came late last week when a hacker group released more than 20,000 hacked DNC emails. The emails cast Wasserman Schultz and her senior staff in not only an unflattering light but also as abettors of Clinton's march to the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 in effect confirming the suspicions of Sanders and his supporters.\n\nWithin days, years of bad blood with Wasserman Schultz had been unleashed and she had been pushed out.\n\nWhat does the future hold for the Florida Democrat? She faces a primary from a Sanders-backed candidate but most political observers say she will win it. Beyond that, few people I talked to had any real sense for where she might go next although Dave Beattie, a Florida pollster and Wasserman Schultz ally, was optimistic.\n\n\"I have worked with her a long time,\" he said. \"She is loyal, works hard, is a staunch advocate for Democrats and is not afraid to raise money.\"\n\nTime will tell. But, it's hard to see Wasserman Schultz's time at the head of the DNC as anything short of a major disappointment for all involved.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-09-19/Getty/455713418.jpg", "title": "Why Debbie Wasserman Schultz failed", "summary": "Enter Wasserman Schultz, a Jewish woman from Florida who had a reputation as a dogged fundraiser and willing attack dog on TV.\nWithin days, years of bad blood with Wasserman Schultz had been unleashed and she had been pushed out.\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee said she will resign this week in the aftermath of the release of thousands of internal email exchanges among Democratic officials.\nBeyond that, few people I talked to had any real sense for where she might go next although Dave Beattie, a Florida pollster and Wasserman Schultz ally, was optimistic.\nFor much of the past two years, rumors of Wasserman Schultz's demise came across the transom with remarkable regularity.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza Writes The Fix A Politics Blog For The Washington Post Hosts The Ciquizza Podcast A Weekly News Quiz Subscribe On"], "keywords": ["schultz", "dnc", "wasnt", "political", "schultzs", "failed", "wasserman", "debbie", "party", "chair", "democratic", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-24 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/clinton-convention-sanders-dnc/2016/07/24/id/740184/", "text": "Hacked emails threatened to overshadow the Democratic Party's upcoming celebration in Philadelphia as progressives expressed disappointment Sunday over the presidential nomination process and Bernie Sanders stepped up demands that the party's chairwoman step down.\n\nBitterness and frustration among the more progressive wing came after some 19,000 emails were published on the website Wikileaks that suggested the Democratic National Committee played favorites during the primary, when Sanders fell short against Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn one leaked email, a DNC official wondered whether Sanders' religious beliefs could be used against him, questioning whether the candidate may be an atheist.\n\nIn televised interviews Sunday, the Vermont senator said the emails proved what he knew was true: The DNC planned to support former Secretary of State Clinton from the start.\n\n\"I'm not shocked, but I'm disappointed\" by the exchanges in the emails, Sanders told ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nSanders pressed for Rep.

Democrats said they wanted to convey a message of optimism and improving the lives of all Americans.\n\nBut party disunity also seems to be a factor in Philadelphia, given Sanders' demands for a new leader and general unhappiness among his many supporters about how the nomination process unfolded.\n\nIt was unclear whether Wasserman Schultz would have a speaking role at the convention. And at least one Sanders' delegate said there was talk of protests during Kaine's acceptance speech.\n\nNorman Solomon, a delegate who supports Bernie Sanders, says there is talk among Sanders' delegates of walking out during Kaine's acceptance speech or turning their backs as a show of protest.\n\nSolomon said he believes a \"vast majority\" of Sanders delegates support these kinds of protests to express their dismay. Sanders' supporters say they are concerned that Kaine is not progressive enough.\n\nDan O'Neal, 68, is a retired school teacher and delegate from Arizona, said Wasserman Schultz has to be censured.\n\n\"We knew they were stacking the deck against Bernie from the get-go, but this type of stuff coming out is outrageous,\" he said. \"It proves our point that they've tried to marginalize him and make it as difficult as possible.\"\n\nTrump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, agreed, saying Sanders' supporters \"have a lot to complain about.\"\n\n\"The emails have proven the system was rigged from the start,\" Manafort told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nClinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, tried to shift blame away from DNC officials to \"Russian state actors\" who, he said, may have hacked into DNC computers \"for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,\" the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHow the emails were stolen hasn't been confirmed.\n\n\"It was concerning last week that Donald Trump changed the Republican platform to become what some experts would regard as pro-Russian,\" Mook said.\n\nClinton is within just days of her long-held ambition to become the party's official presidential nominee.\n\nAfter the DNC released a slightly trimmed list of superdelegates \u2014 those are the party officials who can back any candidate \u2014 it now takes 2,382 delegates to formally clinch the nomination.

At an earlier round-table discussion with emergency medical workers and elected officials, Mrs. Clinton nodded solemnly and hardly spoke, an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump\u2019s 75-minute speech on Thursday night.\n\nAt a rally in Tampa on Friday evening, Mrs. Clinton blasted the bleak vision of America presented by her Republican rival. \u201cThe last thing that we need is somebody who is running for president who talks trash about America,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nShe showed solidarity with Mr. Trump\u2019s top primary rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cI mean, I never thought I\u2019d say these words, but Ted Cruz was right,\u201d she said, and then quoted Mr. Cruz\u2019s despondent Wednesday night speech. \u201cVote your conscience.\u201d\n\nNow some of the job of discrediting Mr. Trump will fall to Mr. Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that he was eager to hit the campaign trail.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJust got off the phone with Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be her running mate.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine have similar positions on many issues, and they are said to share an easy rapport and an interest in policy details. \u201cI do have a fondness for wonks,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in the PBS interview.\n\nAsked whether Mr. Kaine was boring, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cI love that about him.\u201d She added, \u201cHe\u2019s never lost an election.\u201d\n\nRepublicans seized on the selection and tried to sow discord among Democrats, arguing that the pick was evidence that Mrs. Clinton had been dishonest with her party\u2019s liberal base.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s choice of Tim Kaine does nothing to unify a fractured Democrat base which is repelled by her dishonesty and cronyism,\u201d Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. \u201cAfter spending last week pandering to grass-roots Democrats with Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton has chosen someone who holds positions that she\u2019s spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign quickly labeled Mrs. Clinton\u2019s new running mate \u201cCorrupt Kaine,\u201d pointing to lavish gifts he had received during his years as governor and lieutenant governor of Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who\u2019s personally benefited from the rigged system,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump.\n\nWhile many Democrats swiftly praised the move, some in the party\u2019s liberal wing expressed dismay, claiming that Mr. Kaine was out of step with it on some of its core issues, like trade.\n\n\u201cAs we saw in Donald Trump\u2019s speech last night, Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cUnfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe added, \u201cThe mood of the country is a populist one.\u201d\n\nThe son of a welder who owned a small metalworking shop, Mr. Kaine, a Roman Catholic, grew up around Kansas City, Mo.

Mr. Kaine was also considered on Mr. Obama\u2019s shortlist of vice-presidential candidates before Mr. Obama selected Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. In 2012, Mr. Kaine defeated George Allen, a Republican, to take the Senate seat being vacated by the Democrat Jim Webb.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s choice of Mr. Kaine underscores the rising political importance of Virginia, a state with a significant suburban and minority population.\n\nMr. Obama defeated John McCain in the state by more than six percentage points, the first time since Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s victory in 1964 that the state had voted for a Democratic presidential nominee. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll from July 15 shows Mrs. Clinton ahead of Mr. Trump for the state\u2019s 13 electoral votes by nine percentage points.\n\nThe search for a running mate began in April, after Mrs. Clinton had decisively won the New York primary, with a number of candidates.\n\nMrs. Clinton came to the process with a unique vantage point, having been closely involved in her husband\u2019s selection of Senator Al Gore of Tennessee in 1992, a choice that brought youth and Southern charm to a ticket already overflowing with it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith just days remaining before her announcement of a running mate, Mrs. Clinton had not yet made up her mind as her advisers debated what attributes voters might want in a vice president.\n\nAs the search narrowed, Mrs. Clinton wanted to test her chemistry on the campaign trail with Mr. Kaine. After their Virginia rally last week, she invited him to her home in Washington for a meeting that lasted until 10:30 p.m.\n\nLast Saturday, the day after meeting with other candidates in Washington, she invited Mr. Kaine and his wife to lunch at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., with her family.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m. Friday, just after her fiery speech in Tampa, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Kaine to give him the news, before calling President Obama to let him know that she had chosen his friend.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/22/us/HFO-kaine/HFO-kaine-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton Selects Tim Kaine, a Popular Senator From a Swing State, as Running Mate", "summary": "Mr. Kaine was an early endorser of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s presidential bid in the 2008 nominating fight against Mrs. Clinton.\nMr. Kaine was also considered on Mr. Obama\u2019s shortlist of vice-presidential candidates before Mr. Obama selected Senator Joseph R.

Fifty-six percent of Republican insiders said Trump\u2019s speech \u2014 a forceful indictment of those responsible for what he perceives as a country in decline, along with an assurance that he is uniquely qualified to solve the nation\u2019s ills \u2014 made them feel more confident in his candidacy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cTrump gave a simple message and expanded the Republican Party: law and order, economic populism and defeat the rigged system,\u201d said one Iowa Republican \u2014 who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously.\n\n\u201cI felt Trump gave a very good speech and struck on issues and policies that people wanted to hear about,\u201d added a Colorado Republican. \u201cHis family and friends did an excellent job of showing the softer side of Donald Trump and gave America a good view of his family, which says a lot about him as a person. I think he is absolutely right \u2014 this is a movement, not a \u2018normal\u2019 campaign. People have had enough of tired politicians. I think they are going to give him the chance to run the country.\u201d\n\nAdded a Pennsylvania Republican: \u201cHe talked to the people he needed to very effectively. The speech defined the race and made him a voice for the people \u2014 something he should have done months ago.\u201d\n\nFor many of the GOP insiders, Trump\u2019s acceptance speech Thursday night helped overcome other, rockier moments this week, including Ted Cruz\u2019s speech, in which the Texas senator declined to endorse Trump, despite angry protestations from the crowd at Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nFifty-nine percent of Republicans picked Trump\u2019s acceptance speech as the \u201cdefining moment\u201d of the convention, far more than the 28 percent who said Cruz\u2019s televised snub defined the week.\n\nThe Cruz speech received poor marks from those same Republican insiders. Four-in-five said it was a \u201cselfish act\u201d to address the convention without getting behind Trump. Only 20 percent described it as a \u201cprincipled stand.\u201d\n\nCruz \u201cshowed his true colors as just another craven politician willing to put his own political ambition ahead of the interests of the party and the country,\u201d a Colorado Republican said. \u201cIt's a risky bet \u2014 if Hillary wins in November as a result of the divisions Cruz continues to foment within the party, the GOP will hold the senator from Texas partially responsible for the multiple justices that Clinton will appoint to the Supreme Court, undermining the very conservative principles and constitution Ted Cruz claims to champion.\u201d\n\n\u201cCruz almost looks like he trying to ensure that Hillary will win so he can run against her in 2020,\u201d added a Virginia Republican.\n\n\u201cIt was beyond selfish,\u201d a Wisconsin Republican said. \u201cIt was beyond stupid and showed Ted Cruz for what he is. Cruz\u2019s speech was a head-shaking moment. And, he's toast in 2020. Compare him to Ryan.\u201d\n\nTrump certainly still has his Republican critics: Twenty percent said the speech made them less confident in him. And a number of them were despondent in what they saw as an apocalyptic view of the country, when voters want to be inspired.\n\n\u201cIt's not morning in America; it's midnight in America, according to Trump,\u201d a Colorado Republican said. \u201cThis was a long, depressing speech that did not focus on issues that most Americans are concerned about, specifically, the economy.\u201d\n\nAdded a New Hampshire Republican: \u201cWe have handed our Party over to a narcissistic, feckless, classless RINO strongman wannabe who is the only candidate that actually gives the horrid Hillary Clinton a chance to win.\u201d\n\nDemocrats largely agreed: The consensus among insiders wasn\u2019t that Trump will emerge from Cleveland as a stronger candidate. Instead, many of them believed he delivered a dark, angry speech that served as the capstone of an unusual and damaging convention for the GOP.\n\n\u201cAs a Democrat, I heard Trump describe a post-apocalyptic country that I don't live in \u2014 full of fear, terror, and pending economic collapse,\u201d a Colorado Democrat said. \u201cIt seemed like a speech to white America, or those in white America, who fear the social, cultural, and economic change in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was a dumpster fire,\u201d a Florida Democrat said of the convention, \u201cbut Trump's dark, troubling and borderline anti-American speech will define it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of Democrats, 63 percent, said Cruz\u2019s nonendorsement was the defining moment of a convention that, in their eyes, left the GOP more divided than united. It \u201cwas a defining moment of an ill-conceived and poorly executed convention,\u201d one Iowa Democrat said.\n\nBut there were some signs that Trump struck a chord with some of his tougher GOP critics. One Nevada Republican called it \u201cshockingly measured with populist lines that real people will like.\u201d\n\nAnother New Hampshire Republican called it the \u201cbest speech\u201d Trump has given thus far.\n\n\u201cBut probably still not good enough,\u201d the Republican said.\n\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this survey:\n\nColorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer\n\nFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

Trump descended his iconic escalator in Manhattan to announce he was joining a packed field of political veterans seeking the Republican nomination for president, the New York billionaire completed an astonishing and historic political ascent Thursday night in Cleveland, officially claiming his party\u2019s nomination \u2014 and declaring to struggling Americans, \u201cI am your voice.\u201d\n\nTrump electrified the convention crowd on closing night, with chants of \u201cU.S.A.\u201d frequently breaking out as the nominee vowed to put \u201cAmerica first.\u201d He used the speech to align his campaign squarely on the side of struggling American workers of all political stripes, as he moved to broaden his appeal beyond the Republican base that largely decided the primaries.\n\n\u201cEvery day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned. \u2026 These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am your voice.\u201d\n\nAnd he delivered a tough law-and-order message throughout, declaring from the convention floor in Cleveland, \u201cSafety will be restored\u201d under a Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cAmerica will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced,\u201d Trump vowed.\n\nHe described the nation at a \u201cmoment of crisis,\u201d citing terror attacks, violence against police and \u201cchaos in our communities\u201d including rising inner-city crime. \u201cI will restore law and order to our country,\u201d he said, while vowing to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s highly anticipated speech -- at 75 minutes, the longest convention acceptance address since 1972\u200e -- amounts to his closing argument before Clinton and the Democrats get their turn starting Monday in Philadelphia. As much as Republican leaders bashed the presumptive Democratic nominee in Cleveland, Democrats are likely to be just as tough on the Republicans at their convention.\n\nThe next big step for Clinton, though, will be to name her running mate, a decision that could come as early as Friday.\n\nBut before the attention turns to Clinton, Trump got in his final shots.\n\nThe businessman closed his address by turning rival Clinton\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d campaign slogan on its head.\n\n\u201cI choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads, I\u2019m with you,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe blasted Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record as secretary of state \u2013 citing the bloody tumult in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya \u2013 saying her legacy is \u201cdeath, destruction, terrorism and weakness\u201d and a \u201cchange in leadership\u201d is needed.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be America\u2019s legacy,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd defending his aversion to political correctness, he said for anyone who wants to hear \u201cthe corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and the media myths, the Democrats are holding their convention next week -- go there. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.\u201d\n\nTrump also cycled through his campaign promises, including the controversial calls to build a southern border wall and \u201cimmediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want them in our country.\u201d\n\nTrump vowed as well to protect LGBTQ citizens from terrorism like the Orlando club shooting. In a moment that allowed him to show his gay-rights support, Trump thanked the crowd for cheering that line: \u201cIt is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.\u201d\n\nThe speech caps a dramatic convention week marked by powerful displays of party unity but also tensions, flaring most recently when Ted Cruz withheld his endorsement Wednesday night.\n\nThe omission prompted boos from pro-Trump delegates, and the unrest continued into Thursday, when the Texas senator defended his decision before an audience of Texas delegates clearly divided over Cruz\u2019s handling of the convention speech.\n\nAt the same time, Trump\u2019s newly anointed running mate Mike Pence deftly set the stage for Trump\u2019s big night, effectively making the conservative case for the billionaire businessman in his own nomination acceptance speech on Wednesday. The choice of Pence \u2013 a classic conservative with Midwestern roots \u2013 helped bring various factions of the party together even before the convention began.\n\nDespite the Cruz commotion, top party leaders from House Speaker Paul Ryan to RNC Chairman Reince Priebus worked to heal divisions in the party over the course of the Cleveland coming-together.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s brought millions of new voters to our party because he\u2019s listening to Americans\u201d anxious about the state of the country, Priebus said. \u201cWith Donald Trump and Mike Pence, America\u2019s ready for a comeback after almost a decade of Clinton-Obama failures.\u201d\n\nPriebus claimed Republicans are the party with new ideas, while Democrats are the \u201csame party doing the same old thing,\u201d trotting out the \u201csame old candidate\u201d next week.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay united as Republicans,\u201d Priebus said.\n\nMembers of Trump\u2019s family also spent the week giving voters a glimpse into the tycoon\u2019s more personal side, with daughter Ivanka introducing her father Thursday night. Appealing to women, she praised the businessman\u2019s record supporting female employees at his organization. And touting her dad as a tireless fighter who can bring his work ethic and aptitude to the nation\u2019s highest office, Ivanka asked all voters to put their faith in him.\n\n\u201cFor more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people\u2019s champion, and tonight he is the people\u2019s nominee,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 When my father says he\u2019ll make America great again, he will deliver.\u201d", "image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "title": "Trump claims GOP nomination, tells struggling Americans 'I am your voice'", "summary": "As much as Republican leaders bashed the presumptive Democratic nominee in Cleveland, Democrats are likely to be just as tough on the Republicans at their convention.\n\u201cAmerica will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced,\u201d Trump vowed.\n\u201cFor more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people\u2019s champion, and tonight he is the people\u2019s nominee,\u201d she said.\n\u2026 These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cI am your voice.\u201dAnd he delivered a tough law-and-order message throughout, declaring from the convention floor in Cleveland, \u201cSafety will be restored\u201d under a Trump presidency.", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["week", "party", "trump", "cleveland", "voters", "speech", "convention", "political", "tells", "americans", "democrats", "night", "claims", "struggling", "voice", "nomination", "gop"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-21 10:00:59-04:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-rnc-2016_us_5790c893e4b0bdddc4d340e2?section=", "text": "David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images \"In that speech last night I did not say a single negative word about Donald Trump,\" Cruz said.\n\nHours after receiving boos and jeers for not endorsing Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Sen.

In Cleveland, he\u2019s a political dead man\u2014but he still can still play Trump\u2019s hardass law-and-order guy.\n\nCLEVELAND\u2014It was surely different from 2012.\n\nBack then, Chris Christie was a potential candidate introducing himself on the national stage as his party nominated Mitt Romney.\n\nThe Republican convention was the first time many conservatives and Americans around the country learned the facts of what would become the New Jersey governor\u2019s stump speech: that he is the son of an Irish father and a Sicilian mother, that his mother ruled with an iron fist and his dad was, \u201cin the automobile of life,\u201d merely \u201ca passenger.\u201d He was a successful Republican in a blue state, and he got things done. He told it like it was. He was, perhaps, the something different they were looking for.\n\nMemorably, that speech was a giant flop, one that Christie would have to redeem himself from. But back then, there was reason for people to want that redemption. Back then, he had promise. Back then, he had a future.\n\nNow he just has Trump.\n\nChristie took to the stage at the Republican convention on Tuesday night a political dead man.\n\nHe is three years removed from Bridgegate, the scandal that shattered his reputation. He is five months removed from the end of his own presidential campaign, the one he\u2019d waited his whole life to run. He is also five months removed from his decision to endorse Trump, despite having spent much of that campaign arguing that he is unfit to be president, often by doing an above average Trump impersonation.\n\nChristie is a joke again now, worse than he was after the famous traffic jam. He plays second fiddle to a former reality TV star\u2014this from the guy who rose to national prominence for his verbal assaults on the cast of Jersey Shore. He doesn\u2019t just appear to be the butt boy for a neofascist, he reportedly is one. In June, The New Yorker reported that the governor was tasked with fetching the nominee his McDonald\u2019s orders.\n\nDressed in a pinstripe suit and red polka dot tie, he delivered a polemic against Hillary Clinton, running through what he said is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of screw-ups\u2014Libya, Nigeria, Russia, Cuba, China, Iran, her emails\u2014and asking, again and again, if she is \u201cguilty or not guilty.\u201d\n\nHe is a lawyer by trade and a one-time prosecutor, having served as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey.\n\nBut the best Christie can hope for now is to play some variation of a TV judge, as he did Tuesday night. His law-and-order days are behind him, except on stages like this one, where he misrepresents the law he claims to revere in an attempt to elect a man he claimed, not so long ago, was a joke.\n\nStill, he plays the hardass law-and-order guy well, better than Trump, even, since Christie is more focused.\n\nWhen he asked, \u201cGuilty or not guilty?\u201d the crowd sang in response, \u201cGuilty!\u201d\n\nOften, he was interrupted by chants of \u201cLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d\n\nChristie criticized Clinton, perplexingly, for her supposed friendliness toward Russia and claimed she was too nice to dictators, despite Trump\u2019s history of saying flattering things about Vladimir Putin, doing business in Saudi Arabia, and singing the praises of the late Saddam Hussein.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Cable news channels are playing the Melania/Michelle similarities back to back. Everyone knows the Trump campaign is allergic to apologies, but insisting that this was a mere coincidence is just inflaming the media coverage.\n\nIt is, of course, not that big a deal. Melania is neither a politician nor a practiced public speaker. Although she claimed ownership of the Cleveland address in an interview, it\u2019s clear that it was largely the work of speechwriters. What, they thought no one would notice that the current first lady used some of the same phrases in 2008?\n\nSo in insisting that the story is bogus, campaign officials are actually giving it legs by prompting anchors and reporters to prove the case and to question why the Trump operation persists in its denials.\n\n\u201cThere's no cribbing of Michelle Obama's speech,\u201d campaign chief Paul Manafort told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d this morning. \u201cThese were common words and values \u2026To think that she would be cribbing Michelle Obama's words is crazy.

They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama, 2008:\n\n\n\n\u201cBarack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you\u2019re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don\u2019t know them, and even if you don\u2019t agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children \u2014 and all children in this nation \u2014 to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.\u201d\n\nWhatever you think of the contretemps, I love that it was broken by a random dude on Twitter. Jarrett Hill, described as an interior designer and journalist, was sitting in a Starbucks in L.A. when he noticed one similarity from eight years ago and began checking for others.\n\nThe other striking thing from last night: While Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in Benghazi, was blaming Hillary Clinton on stage, Trump called in to Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2014essentially preempting his own convention for those few minutes.

(Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nOn the eve of the two national political conventions that will shape the images of the major-party presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a competitive contest nationally but with the presumptive Republican nominee facing deficits on key character attributes and issues, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nThe survey shows Clinton leading Trump by 47 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. That represents a shift in Trump\u2019s direction since last month\u2019s Post-ABC poll, which showed Clinton leading by 12 points. In the new poll, Clinton leads by 10 points among all adults \u2014 50 percent to 40 percent \u2014 compared with a 14-point lead among this wider group last month.\n\nBoth candidates remain highly unpopular \u2014 the two most unpopular in the history of Post-ABC polling. By about 2 to 1 (64 percent to 31 percent), Americans view Trump unfavorably. Clinton\u2019s numbers are not quite as negative \u2014 42 percent favorable and 54 percent unfavorable. Half of all registered voters say they have strongly unfavorable views of Trump, while 47 percent say they have strongly unfavorable views of Clinton \u2014 the highest ever in a Post-ABC poll for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey also highlights the degree to which Americans are motivated by negative impulses rather than seeing the choice in positive terms. Almost 6 in 10 say they are dissatisfied with the choice of Trump vs. Clinton. Fifty-four percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters say they are mainly voting against Trump, while 57 percent of Trump supporters say they are mainly voting against Clinton.\n\nGiven the dissatisfaction, there is the possibility that candidates from minor parties will attract the support of disaffected voters. In a four-way matchup that also includes Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party, the poll results are Clinton 42 percent, Trump 38 percent, Johnson 8 percent and Stein 5 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new poll comes after a tumultuous two weeks that included the killings of five police officers in Dallas and deadly shootings by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. As the calling for the poll was closing came news of an apparent terrorist attack in Nice, France. All these events have added to the tensions of a country on edge and heightened the importance of security and racial issues in the choice of a president.\n\nThe poll also comes after Clinton was spared prosecution by the government for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. But while avoiding any criminal charge, Clinton received a stern rebuke from FBI Director James B. Comey, who said she and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of sensitive classified material in their email exchanges.\n\nThe previous Post-ABC poll showed Clinton with a larger lead than some other national surveys taken around the same time. Whether or how much the shift toward Trump in the current survey was affected by how the FBI investigation was resolved can\u2019t be measured. Other recent polls show the difference in the race nationally to be in low single digits, with Clinton generally enjoying the advantage.\n\nRepublicans begin their nominating convention here in Cleveland on Monday and will conclude Thursday with the expected nomination of Trump, with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate.\n\nHere are some of the people who are speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland \u2014 and some who have opted to skip the event. (Sarah Parnass,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Democratic convention, in Philadelphia, will begin July 25, with Clinton poised to become the first woman nominated for president by a major party. She is still mulling her vice-presidential choice and met with several contenders Friday.\n\nTrump hopes to produce a convention that helps to alleviate questions about his fitness to be president among many Americans, but he begins with an enormous deficit on that issue. The Post-ABC poll found that nearly six in 10 registered voters say he is not qualified to serve as president \u2014 with 49 percent saying they strongly believe that. Meanwhile, Clinton is seen as qualified to serve as president by 56 percent of voters.\n\nAmong Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, about 7 in 10 see Trump as qualified to be president \u2014 but almost one-quarter of that part of the electorate still questions the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s fitness.\n\nThe survey highlights familiar fault lines in the electorate. Trump leads among men, 49 percent to 41 percent, while Clinton enjoys an even larger margin among women, 52 to 38 percent. Voters ages 18 to 39 support Clinton 54 to 34 percent, while those 65 and older back Trump 51 to 42 percent. Those between 40 and 65 are almost evenly divided. Trump leads by 15 percentage points among white voters, while Clinton has a huge 52 percentage point lead among nonwhite voters.\n\nAt this point, the Democrats are slightly more united behind Clinton than Republicans are behind Trump. One goal of the Trump campaign is to leave Cleveland at the end of the week with the party more united and enthusiastic about the nominee. Currently, 86 percent of Democrats back Clinton, while 82 percent of Republicans back Trump.\n\nIndependent voters lean toward Trump, 47 to 41 percent, although winning independents is no guarantee of winning the presidency. Four years ago, Mitt Romney won among independents while losing to President Obama.\n\nClinton enjoys the support of 8 in 10 self-identified liberals, while 7 in 10 conservatives back Trump. Moderates go decisively for Clinton, 52 to 36 percent.\n\nThe contest between Clinton and Trump highlights one potential shift in the electorate that will be closely watched between now and November: the division among voters based on educational attainment.\n\nTrump\u2019s most important block of voters are whites without college degrees, who support Trump by a margin of 60 to 33 percent. But college-educated white voters have been shifting toward the Democrats, and the poll underscores that the competition for those voters will be hard-fought and potentially decisive in the election\u2019s outcome. Republicans historically have carried the votes of whites with college degrees, and Romney won the group by 14 points over Obama four years ago.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll finds whites with college degrees are evenly divided \u2014 43 percent Trump, 42 percent Clinton, with an outsize 10 percent volunteering support for \u201cneither.\u201d When gender is included in the analysis, the poll finds that white women with college degrees narrowly support Clinton, while white men with college degrees support Trump by a slightly larger margin.\n\nOf seven issues tested, Clinton has double-digit advantages over Trump on three \u2014 race relations, handling an international crisis and immigration. Clinton has smaller edges on looking out for the middle class and handling terrorism, while Trump holds small edges on taxes and the economy.\n\nAcross six attributes, Trump has an 11-point margin among registered voters on the question of which candidate would do the most to bring needed change to Washington. By a margin of five points, he is seen as more honest and trustworthy. Clinton has a similar edge on empathy with people\u2019s problems and representing people\u2019s values and holds double-digit edges on having better judgment and having a presidential personality and temperament.\n\nIn an election that is likely to be framed as a choice of continuity with Obama\u2019s policies vs. a change in direction led by a Washington outsider with no previous political experience, a bare majority of voters say they prefer experience in politics to someone outside the establishment. That\u2019s a narrower margin than earlier in the year, when 59 percent said they favored a politically experienced candidate. The poll indicated there was growing support for an outsider among Republicans and independents.\n\nClinton\u2019s trust deficit is highlighted on another question in the poll: whether she is too willing to bend the rules.

Wouldn't that be nice?\"\n\nPence has opted for stronger rhetoric, telling the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015 that, \"A new Iron Curtain is descending down the spine of Europe as modern Russia seeks to redraw the map of Europe by force.\"\n\nHe added, \"Putin's Russia ignores talk of sanctions, claims land and supports rebels in Ukraine with impunity.\"\n\nAnd Pence has previously taken issue with some of Trump's national security proposals, calling his proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the U.S. \"offensive and unconstitutional\" in a December tweet.\n\nCalls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. \u2014 Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015\n\nStatement on Preventing Muslim Immigration: https://t.co/HCWU16z6SR pic.twitter.com/d1dhaIs0S7 \u2014 Donald J.

The Navy has fewer ships than at any time since 1916, and our Air Force has its smallest tactical fighter force in history,\" Pence said at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nTrump made similar statements in an April foreign policy address.\n\n\"Our active-duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Indiana governor has also echoed Trump's critique of the President's preferred terminology for terrorist groups.\n\n\"Lecturing the American people about the crusades while refusing to call Islamic extremism by name is an abdication of leadership,\" Pence told CPAC.\n\nThey also largely agree on Israel -- nowadays.\n\nPence is an avid backer of the Middle Eastern ally, telling the CPAC audience, \"Israel's cause is our cause\" and voicing approval of the decision by then-House Speaker John Boehner to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal the White House was then negotiating with Tehran.\n\nTrump has also blasted the deal, and has recently staked out an aggressively pro-Israel stance.\n\n\"Israel is a very, very important ally of the United States and we are going to protect them 100%,\" he said last week, rebuffing an audience member's criticism of the country.\n\nBut last winter, Trump was castigated by many Republicans for declining to promise to keep Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel.

(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nA petty thief and brawler who plowed a mile-long path of horror through Bastille Day celebrations on Nice\u2019s seafront had no known connections to terrorist groups, a French prosecutor said Friday as investigators scrambled to piece together whether the attack that claimed 84 lives was directed by Islamist militant networks.\n\nThe scale of the carnage wrought by a man authorities identified as 31-year-old Tunisian immigrant Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel came into grim focus Friday, with 10 children among the dead and 202 people injured. Among the wounded, 50 were \u201cbetween life and death,\u201d according to French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nThe attack with a 19-ton rented Renault truck \u2014 the third mass- casualty assault to hit to France in 18 months \u2014 shocked the nation and sparked questions about whether authorities had done enough to safeguard a country that is an obvious target of terrorist groups. Many witnesses said Friday that the packed corniche had been only lightly guarded by police during fireworks on the gently warm night. Bouhlel, a truck driver, was easily able to drive around police fences blocking Nice\u2019s famous Promenade des Anglais before jamming on the accelerator and zigzagging his way through the crowds in a method that seemed calculated to generate maximum bloodshed.\n\nThe identities of the victims testified to France\u2019s diverse society and to the international appeal of the tony French Riviera. A vacationing father and his 11-year-old son from Lakeway, Tex. A headscarf-wearing Muslim woman who came to celebrate Bastille Day with her nieces and nephews. A French high school teacher, his wife, daughter and grandson. Others from Russia, Switzerland, Germany, Australia.\n\nThere were so many victims early Friday that survivors grabbed tablecloths from seaside cafes to cover the bodies strewn across the asphalt. The dead were marked by rectangular orange and white traffic-control barriers that stood like rows of tombstones.\n\nThe Washington Post's Michael Birnbaum reports from Nice, France a day after at least 84 people were killed when Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. (Michael Birnbaum,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\n[Texas father and son among the dead]\n\n\u2018A war waged on us\u2019\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls on Friday drew a strong link to terrorism, despite the fact that no militant group had claimed responsibility for the attack and Bouhlel had no known ties to such organizations.\n\n\u201cThe threat of terrorism, as we have now been saying for a long time, is weighing heavily on France, and it will continue to do so for a long time yet,\u201d Valls said after an emergency meeting in Paris. \u201cWe are facing a war waged on us by terrorism.\u201d\n\nFrench citizens are clearly reaching their limit. Valls and Hollande \u2014 whose popularity is scraping record lows \u2014 were booed when they visited the seaside scene of the attack Friday, in an apparent sign of anger over security lapses.\n\nFrance was shaken by a terrorist attack in January 2015, when militant Islamist attackers took aim at the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher grocery store in Paris. Attackers struck again in November in a popular nightclub district of the capital, setting off bombs and raking the area with gunfire.\n\nThis time, the French population had just relaxed after living for weeks on heightened alert during European soccer championships that concluded Sunday. Hours before the violence in Nice, Hollande had announced that he planned to allow a state of emergency to expire at the end of the month. On Friday, Hollande said it would be extended for three months instead, and he said he would boost France\u2019s role in the Islamic State strongholds of Syria and Iraq.\n\n[How the Nice truck attack managed to kill so many so quickly]\n\nGeorgetown University faculty member Rollie Flynn spent 30 years working with the CIA and identifies the traits of a lone wolf terrorist attack and why they are difficult to police. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\nThe attack was a \u201cbarbaric act,\u201d Hollande said after meeting with top officials in Nice. \u201cAn individual who took a truck and murdered people with it.\u201d\n\nBelgium, Germany and Italy stepped up security along their borders on Friday, in a measure of fears that the violence in France could spill into neighboring countries. Belgium \u2014 which was struck by a bomb attack at the Brussels airport and a subway station in March \u2014 is particularly nervous ahead of its own national day Thursday.\n\nAs investigators struggled to understand whether Bouhlel had acted alone, they offered a first account of his path toward the murderous drive that concluded in a hail of bullets from police officers who forced the truck to a stop outside the grand Palais de la Mediterranee, a hotel.\n\nBouhlel was a Tunisian citizen who had lived in Nice since at least 2010, when he first ran afoul of authorities by engaging in petty theft, according to Paris Prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins. Most recently, he had been given a suspended six-month prison sentence related to a January assault, Molins said.\n\nBouhlel is divorced and has three children, neighbors said. The prosecutor said the suspect\u2019s ex-wife was taken in for questioning.\n\nTruck\u2019s deadly path\n\nAs fireworks lit up the sky Thursday in celebration of Bastille Day, Bouhlel drove the rented truck toward its fatal destination, Molins said. In the cab he carried an automatic pistol, two fake assault rifles, a non-working hand grenade and a phony pistol. He swerved around a police barrier blocking the Promenade des Anglais just next to a children\u2019s hospital, then sped through the crowds, leaving carnage in his path. More than a mile later, three police officers traded fire with him, Molins said. Authorities think the truck kept going 300 yards after he had been shot. Police found him dead in the passenger seat.\n\nBouhlel was \u201centirely unknown\u201d to anti-terrorist units, the prosecutor said. \u201cYesterday\u2019s attack has not yet been claimed, but I must stay that this kind of attack is in line with the type advocated by the terrorist organizations in various videos,\u201d he said.\n\n[Shouts, a desperate dash and then \u2018bodies, limbs and blood\u2019]\n\nWitnesses described confusion and chaos Thursday night as hundreds of panicked bystanders ran to try to escape the deadly truck.\n\nAfter the fireworks, Adrien Dobrescu, 54, who was visiting from Romania, heard more sharp bangs. \u201cSomeone was screaming, and I saw gunfire,\u201d he said. He ran with a crowd as fast as he could off the promenade. \u201cI had waited two, four minutes, I would be dead, too.\u201d\n\nSurvivors were left to deal with the wounded and dead.\n\n\u201cThere were so many injured, and dead bodies,\u201d said Fiona Le Goff, 27, a concierge at an apartment building facing the Promenade des Anglais. \u201cThe worst was a woman whose body was just stuck to the street.\u201d\n\nLater, she surveyed the area as forensic teams moved in. \u201cThere were people just covered with white cloths,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d\n\nAfter the bodies of victims had been hauled away Friday, the macabre truck remained for hours. More than 25 bullet holes riddled its front, and its doors stood open while investigators searched it. Barely 100 yards away, mourners piled flowers and remembrances at the base of a palm tree, some of them crying while they sang \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d France\u2019s anthem.\n\nFrance declared three days of mourning beginning Saturday, and flags will fly at half-staff.\n\nAt a White House meeting with foreign diplomats Friday, President Obama lamented that \u201cso many children\u201d were killed or hurt in the \u201csickening attack\u201d in Nice. He said he spoke to Hollande earlier in the day and pledged that the United States would stand with France \u201cas we defend our nations against this scourge of terrorism and violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese terrorists are targeting and killing innocent people of all backgrounds and faiths, including Muslims,\u201d Obama said. He vowed to \u201ckeep taking out\u201d Islamic State leaders on the battlefield.\n\nAmong the dead were two Americans: Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son, Brodie, from Lakeway, about 20 miles west of Austin, who were vacationing in Europe, the family said in a statement.\n\nA U.S. student, Nicolas Leslie, 20, was missing, the University of California at Berkeley said in a statement.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article referred to an interview given to the local Nice-Matin newspaper by a Nice-based lawyer who claimed to have been the court-appointed lawyer of the Nice attacker. It did not refer to the lawyer, Corentin Delobel, by name. Delobel, who was widely interviewed by local and international press after the attack, has acknowledged that he had never represented Bouhlel, and misrepresented himself when media contacted him, the head of the Nice lawyers\u2019 association said.

Pence recently sealed his congressional library until 2022. The records could be unsealed if the governor were to die before that date. That\u2019s 12 years' worth of records from his time in Congress. Michael Cherkis of The Huffington Post spoke with the archives director, Dina Kellams, at the University of Indiana in Bloomington, where the records are kept. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s not standard but it\u2019s not unusual.\u201d\n\nThere were many inferences about how Ohio Gov. John Kasich was a good general election candidate, despite his less than stellar performance in the 2016 primaries. Trump\u2019s base of support is from white, working class voters\u2014and Indiana (and Ohio) is ground zero for that slice of the electorate, which the Trump campaign sees as their ticket to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Perhaps, that\u2019s why Trump decided to pick someone from the Rust Belt to help consolidate that support. Indiana is known as the RV capital of the world, and a state dotted by factory workers in what once was a bastion of American manufacturing.\n\nHillary Clinton, who is weak on trade, is vulnerable with these voters, who view North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as the source of their job losses. They also hold the contested Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement the Obama administration is trying to push through with equal scorn. Hillary supported Bill\u2019s signing of the NAFTA, and once called TPP the gold standard for trade agreements. This flip-flopping on trade, coupled with her abysmal numbers on trust and honesty, make her even more vulnerable to someone the likes of Trump, who is also a flawed candidate. Nevertheless, he was never under an FBI investigation. Director James Comey's damning report on Clinton's email usage while she was secretary of state also didn't do her any favors. She\u2019s polling in a dead heat with Trump, erasing her 8-to-10 point lead.\n\nThose emails matter, her position on trade with these voters matter, and she\u2019s just generally not liked.

(Sarah Parnass,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s convention will feature an eclectic mix of cultural figures, including the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, survivors of the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and an underwear model.\n\nBut while several Republican Party establishment figures will take the stage next week in Cleveland, the national convention to officially make Trump the party\u2019s presidential nominee will be devoid of some of the GOP\u2019s most seasoned leaders and brightest new stars.\n\nRepublican officials on Thursday released a long-awaited list of convention personalities billed as \u201cnon-conventional speakers\u201d who emphasize \u201creal world experience.\u201d\n\nThe convention\u2019s theme will be Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d with a core focus on national security, immigration, trade and jobs.\n\nThe program includes more than a dozen current and former elected officials, including the leaders of the party\u2019s congressional wing, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.).\n\nA whole host of influential Republicans have decided not to attend next week's Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n[Analysis: The stumbling blocks for an anti-Trump mutiny]\n\nA handful of governors and other lawmakers are scheduled to give addresses, including former primary opponents Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a unified convention,\u201d Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Thursday, adding that the announced agenda was only a partial list of speakers. \u201cPeople are going to be united behind Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nThe unusual collection of nonpolitical speakers seems designed to broaden Trump\u2019s appeal. Roster names include retired astronaut Eileen Collins, the first female space-shuttle pilot and mission commander; Mark Geist and John Tiegen, two survivors of the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi; and Antonio Sabato Jr., a former Calvin Klein underwear model, soap-opera actor and reality-television star.\n\nSome sports figures will take the stage here, including pro golfer Natalie Gulbis and Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White.\n\nTim Tebow, a 28-year-old former National Football League quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner, was expected to speak at the gathering, according to GOP officials. Tebow is admired by many conservatives because of his outspoken evangelical Christian beliefs.\n\nBut Tebow said Thursday night in a Facebook video that he would not be speaking: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how fast rumors fly.

Mike Pence, who was identified by Trump allies Thursday as the candidate\u2019s likely vice presidential pick. If chosen, Pence would deliver an acceptance speech after being formally nominated for vice president.\n\nTwo other vice-presidential finalists, Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), are listed on the program, as is Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), who also was vetted as a vice-presidential prospect.\n\nNot speaking in Cleveland are the GOP\u2019s past two presidential nominees, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), as well as its only two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush. None will be in Cleveland for the week-long festivities.\n\nAlso excluded from the speakers list are many of the party\u2019s more diverse rising stars, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Tim Scott (S.C.), and Rep. Mia Love (Utah).\n\nBy contrast, the Democratic National Convention the following week in Philadelphia is expected to feature a full assortment of party stars \u2014 past, present and future \u2014 including President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden, former president Bill Clinton, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.).\n\nThe disparity in political star power between the conventions speaks volumes about the state of the two parties, with Republicans divided over their controversial new standard-bearer.\n\n[Cleveland braces for spillover on the streets]\n\nLooking ahead to Philadelphia, Republican strategist Rick Wilson said of the Democrats, \u201cBill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren \u2014 they\u2019re all going to be out there swinging for the fences. But the Republicans, it\u2019ll be like a hostage video of people forced on stage.\u201d\n\nThe Cleveland convention will be orchestrated to help expand Trump\u2019s appeal to the general electorate. To that end, several members of his family are expected to give speeches, including his wife, Melania, and his four oldest children: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.\n\nIn addition, other speakers who have known Trump and his family through the years plan to take the stage. They include Haskel Lookstein, a rabbi in New York who converted Ivanka Trump to Judaism; Tom Barrack, a wealthy California-based investor who has worked with Donald Trump on real-estate deals; and Kerry Woolard, the general manager of Trump Winery in Virginia.\n\nWith the public on edge following a spate of shootings by police and last week\u2019s killing of five officers in Dallas, Trump has sought to brand himself as the law-and-order candidate. Some speakers at the Cleveland convention could help him make that case, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a Democrat who is an outspoken critic of the Black Lives Matter movement and is a frequent Fox News Channel guest; former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; and two female attorneys general, Pam Bondi of Florida and Leslie Rutledge of Arkansas.\n\nSeveral early Trump backers are being rewarded with convention speaking slots, among them Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, a college founded by his late televangelist father. Falwell campaigned frequently at Trump\u2019s side leading up to the Iowa caucuses.\n\nBut one especially prominent Trump surrogate is not listed as a speaker: Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee, who has garnered mixed reviews for her campaign-trail appearances supporting Trump.\n\nHere in Cleveland, the Republican National Convention\u2019s Rules Committee convened early Thursday and met late into the night to review the 42 rules governing the party structure and the selection of a presidential candidate. The big undecided issue remains whether or not to continue binding convention delegates to the results of caucuses and primaries or to unbind delegates and allow them to vote however they want.\n\nAnother subject of talks, which eventually collapsed with no resolution, centered on whether to return the party to closed contests \u2014 meaning that only Republicans could vote in presidential caucuses and primaries. A group led by Ken Cuccinnelli, the former Virginia attorney general, also wanted to make other changes to party operations.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and several members of the party\u2019s leadership generally support the idea of reverting back to closed contests by awarding more convention delegates to states that hold closed contests.\n\nCuccinnelli said he proposed giving 20 percent more delegates to states that opted to hold a closed contest. Priebus and his team considered the offer, cut ultimately declined, according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe and Dan Balz contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/07/14/National-Politics/Images/AP_Poll_Campaign_2016-9022a.jpg", "title": "Republican convention\u2019s \u2018non-conventional\u2019 list: Model, astronaut and Trump clan", "summary": "A whole host of influential Republicans have decided not to attend next week's Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\nHere are some of the people who are speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland and some who've opted to skip the event.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a unified convention,\u201d Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Thursday, adding that the announced agenda was only a partial list of speakers.\n(Sarah Parnass,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)Here are some of the people who are speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland and some who've opted to skip the event.\nJohn Kasich Kasich has declined to endorse Trump and is spending convention week meeting with state delegations and other Republican groups.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Philip Rucker Is The White House Bureau Chief For The Washington Post He Previously Has Covered Congress The Obama White House The Presidential Campaigns He Joined The Post In As A Local News Reporter"], "keywords": ["clan", "speakers", "gov", "trump", "national", "convention", "list", "including", "conventions", "nonconventional", "trumps", "cleveland", "astronaut", "model", "republican", "speaking"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-13 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/13/ginsburg-under-fire-from-both-sides-over-highly-inappropriate-trump-comments.html", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a growing and bipartisan backlash Wednesday -- including a call from Donald Trump to resign -- as she doubled down on her criticism of the presumptive GOP nominee, calling him a \u201cfaker\u201d who is unqualified to be president.\n\nEven political figures and newspaper editorial writers who might agree with the comments swiftly said they were out of line for a high court justice.\n\nAnd Trump himself lashed out on Twitter, saying:\n\nJustice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Clinton, meanwhile, held a rally Tuesday with Bernie Sanders to shore up the progressive vote to take on Trump.\n\nBut in Dallas, the mood was far more somber as President Barack Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, put their own partisan differences aside and gathered for a memorial service for five police officers slain last week. Obama spent much of Monday out of public view preparing his remarks, and his appearance with Bush offered a rare moment of unity and bipartisanship to a country struggling to bridge racial and ideological divides.\n\n\"We are not as divided as we seem,\" Obama said. \"I know that because I know America.\"\n\nSearing tests\n\nTaken together, Tuesday's flurry of events represent tests for the country's leaders -- past and present -- amid a surge of public anxiety over terror attacks, gun violence, racial tensions and economic dislocation that is shaping the presidential race and threatening to deliver a late-term blow to Obama's legacy.\n\nThe rituals of eulogizing the dead and consoling grief stricken relatives that Obama will endure Tuesday were painfully familiar, after a string of visits during his presidency to cities scarred by mass shootings.\n\n\"I have spoken at too many memorials during this presidency,\" Obama said.\n\nHe faced an extreme balancing act during the service .\n\nHe sought to honor police officers gunned down while on duty by an African-American man who said he wanted to kill white cops. But Obama also worked to give voice to the anger and fear over a spate of killings of black men by police that has triggered deep anger and fear in minority communities.\n\nObama's challenging task was to paint some national narrative of healing that could ease tensions enough to allow frank discussions on an issue that threatens to spiral out of control and claim more lives in a senseless escalation of violence.\n\n\"He has got to acknowledge the lethal and ferocious assault on that police department there in Dallas,\" said Michael Eric Dyson, author of the book, \"The Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America.\"\n\n\"And he has got to acknowledge the lethal and ferocious assault on black men and women's lives in America,\" Dyson told CNN's \"Wolf\" show.\n\nObama has walked that rhetorical tightrope as he weighed in on killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota.\n\n\"When people say 'Black Lives Matter,' that doesn't mean blue lives don't matter,\" Obama said in Poland. But within hours, the depth of the problem was revealed when five \"blue lives\" -- those of the Dallas policemen -- were taken in Dallas, a city that ironically had been earning plaudits for improving relations between its Police Department and minority communities.\n\nObama's former personal aide Reggie Love told CNN Monday he doesn't know how Obama balances the situation, as well the President's own internal conflicts.\n\n\"He's definitely the first African-American president so this is something that's always heavy for him, but he's also the leader of the free world,\" Love told CNN's \"New Day.\" \"I think it's important to unify the country as a whole and not just address one specific gender or one specific race.\"\n\nShow of unity\n\nIn a show of unity, Bush made a rare appearance on the national stage alongside his successor -- to help salve the grief of a city where he has made his post-White House home and built a presidential library since leaving office.\n\nHis presence was a reminder that he will be conspicuous by his absence at another event where a former President would have been expected to play a visible role -- the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland.\n\nBush, his father former President George H.W. Bush and his brother, former GOP candidate Jeb Bush, are among hordes of Republican establishment figures who will skip the quadrennial GOP party because of their discomfort with Trump.\n\nThe presidential race, meanwhile, will rage on.\n\nClinton and Sanders held a joint rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire -- a moment of Democratic Party unity that often looked like it would never happen.\n\nThe primary rivals began the work of folding Sanders' \"political revolution\" into Clinton's establishment campaign, following exhaustive talks on the party platform which offered Sanders concessions on issues including health care and education.\n\nThe Vermont senator offered Clinton only tepid credit for her victorious primary campaign after they slogged through bitter primary and caucus battles, so the body language on Tuesday was important -- and sometimes awkward.\n\nTrump has his own political divides to bridge on Tuesday -- and it is possible that his appearance with Pence could be a taste of things to come if he chooses the longtime conservative favorite as his vice presidential nominee.\n\nLeslie Lenkowsky, a Hoosier State politics expert at Indiana University, said Pence's credibility among social conservatives could counter the presumptive Republican nominee's weakness with the crucial GOP constituency -- especially if he makes the GOP ticket.\n\n\"He certainly brings absolutely solid conservative credentials -- Trump has been criticized by Ted Cruz and some others for not really being conservative,\" he said.\n\nBut it is Trump who will set the tone Tuesday.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160710160632-president-obama-in-poland-july-9-2016-super-tease.jpg", "title": "Grief, politics and a day of presidential contrasts", "summary": "\"When people say 'Black Lives Matter,' that doesn't mean blue lives don't matter,\" Obama said in Poland.\nClinton, meanwhile, held a rally Tuesday with Bernie Sanders to shore up the progressive vote to take on Trump.\n(CNN) The gulf between those who have occupied the Oval Office and those who crave it is on rare display Tuesday.\nObama has walked that rhetorical tightrope as he weighed in on killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota.\n\"\"And he has got to acknowledge the lethal and ferocious assault on black men and women's lives in America,\" Dyson told CNN's \"Wolf\" show.", "source": "CNN", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "keywords": ["sanders", "trump", "told", "gop", "grief", "bush", "lives", "president", "contrasts", "politics", "obama", "day", "presidential", "black"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-11 00:00:00", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/07/11/leading-candidate-for-new-british-prime-minister-after-motherhood-remarks-n2191047", "text": "The United Kingdom is still searching for a new prime minister after David Cameron announced his resignation after being on the losing side of \"Brexit.\" Two women were the leading candidates to be his successor, but one has just disqualified herself for making insensitive comments about motherhood and politics.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nWhile Clinton has long supported the creation of new government-run insurance options and reiterated that support several times this year, Saturday\u2019s statement comes three days before she is scheduled to make her first joint campaign appearance with Sanders \u2015 who has championed government-run insurance and federally financed clinics throughout his career and during his own bid for the presidency.\n\nSanders, who ran a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination, is expected to endorse Clinton at that Tuesday event. Saturday\u2019s announcement on health policy follows a similar one from Clinton earlier in the week, that she was enhancing her own proposal on college tuition assistance to match the considerably more generous version Sanders had sketched out.\n\nIn describing the proposals to The Huffington Post, senior Clinton campaign aides noted that Sanders had championed these ideas \u2015 and, in particular, that the former Secretary of State\u2019s funding proposal for the clinics matched one that the independent senator had made.\n\nAlready, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. Hillary Clinton\n\n\u201cWe have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,\u201d Clinton said in a press release that the campaign circulated late Saturday morning. \u201cAlready, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.\u201d\n\nSanders said in a conference call shortly afterwards that the announcement was the product of discussion between the two campaigns. He praised Clinton\u2019s proposal in strong, unambiguous terms \u2015 describing it as \u201can extremely important initiative\u201d and predicting that \u201cit will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America, and it will cut health care costs.\u201d\n\nThe idea of the public option \u2015 as first sketched out by Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist \u2015 is to create a separate, government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers offering coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. The hope is that this competition can help keep premiums for all the insurance plans low, particularly if the government-run plan has the ability to dictate low reimbursement rates to doctors, hospitals, drugmakers, and other suppliers of medical care.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Democratic leaders included versions of the public option in their proposals when they first began working on health care reform in 2009. But they ended up jettisoning the idea in response to protests from more conservative Democrats, who were less enthusiastic about government programs and industry groups, like hospitals and insurance companies, that feared what a public option would do to their income streams.\n\nThe idea of a Medicare buy-in has been around for even longer, although it, too, appeared in 2009 when Democrats were drawing up health care legislation. The goal, again, would be to give consumers \u2015 in this case, those older than 55 and at greater risk of becoming sick \u2015 one more insurance option if they can\u2019t get coverage through an employer or an existing government program.\n\nClinton has expressed support for both ideas during the 2016 campaign, noting that she had called for them previously. (She made a public option part of her campaign proposal to reform health care in 2008.) But campaign aides said Saturday\u2019s announcement is a reminder of how seriously she takes the idea \u2015 and her determination to promote it as president.\n\nJim Young / Reuters U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she\u2019s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years.\n\nThat might reassure some of the progressive Sanders supporters skeptical of Clinton\u2019s commitment to their values and goals \u2015 and, in some cases, angry at her attacks on Sanders\u2019 proposal to create a single, government-run insurance plan that would provide coverage to all Americans, supplanting private insurance altogether.\n\nOf course, Clinton\u2019s announcement comes with no policy details. She isn\u2019t answering any of the many complicated questions that either proposal would raise \u2015 like exactly how either the Obamacare public option or Medicare buy-in plan would pay the providers of medical services, or exactly who could enroll in either one.\n\nClinton\u2019s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she\u2019s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. She hasn\u2019t identified new revenue or spending cuts to cover the cost of the proposal, but she has said that she will remain true to her pledge to pay for the price of any proposals \u2015 a pledge that she has largely kept in this campaign, independent budget analysts say.\n\nAnd while the clinic proposal likely to get a lot less attention than anything Clinton says about the public option of Medicare, the idea, if implemented, could help a great many people get medical care.\n\nThe clinics are the backbone of the nation\u2019s health care safety net, providing primary care to millions of Americans who either have no health insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t meet their needs \u2015 a group that, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is large and underserved.\n\nAbout one in 14 Americans currently gets health care through a federally funded clinic, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s thanks to annual funding of about $5 billion, a big chunk of which comes from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that Sanders championed.\n\n\u201cThis would be a substantial infusion of funding,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. \u201cMore funding for community health centers creates an infrastructure to care for increasing numbers of insured people and also provides resources to reach the remaining uninsured to encourage them to get covered.\u201d\n\nFederal clinics happen to be one of the few government-run healthcare programs with a history of strong bipartisan support. George W. Bush was a big fan during his presidency, for example. So while both a public option and Medicare buy-in would likely run into the same political opposition that stopped them in 2009,more money for clinics would have a chance of becoming law even with Republicans controlling a house of Congress.\n\nThis article has been updated to include more specific details on Clinton\u2019s proposal and reactions to it.\n\nCLARIFICATION: Language has been updated to indicate that Clinton expressed support for the public option on her campaign site before the Saturday announcement.", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/578106ed1a00002600dd0672.jpeg", "title": "Clinton Reaffirms Support For Public Option In Bid For Sanders Supporters", "summary": "Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support on Saturday for creating a \u201cpublic option\u201d within Obamacare and allowing people to enroll in Medicare at age 55.\nCLARIFICATION: Language has been updated to indicate that Clinton expressed support for the public option on her campaign site before the Saturday announcement.\n(She made a public option part of her campaign proposal to reform health care in 2008.\nPresident Barack Obama and Democratic leaders included versions of the public option in their proposals when they first began working on health care reform in 2009.\nAbout one in 14 Americans currently gets health care through a federally funded clinic, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.", "source": "Huffington Post", "bias": "Bias: Left", "authors": ["Senior National Correspondent The Huffington Post", "Jonathan Cohn"], "keywords": ["sanders", "clinton", "supporters", "campaign", "clinics", "support", "reaffirms", "insurance", "health", "bid", "proposal", "public", "care", "option"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "None", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/ben-carson-dallas-shooting-obama-225278", "text": "GOP rips Obama after Dallas shooting 'Now is definitely not the time to get political,' Ben Carson says.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's political opponents quickly piled on after news emerged that a gunman had killed five police officers in Dallas, assailing him for his focus on gun control, his overseas trip, and his treatment of the law enforcement community.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier in Warsaw, Poland, where he is attending a NATO meeting, Obama on Friday called the Dallas shooting a \"wrenching reminder of the sacrifices\" law enforcement makes for the American people, but also remarked \"that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes it more deadly and more tragic, and in the days ahead we are going to have to consider those realities as well.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBen Carson lit into Obama within the first hour after his remarks.\n\n\"Now is definitely not the time to get political,\" the former Republican presidential candidate and Donald Trump surrogate told \"Fox & Friends\" when asked about Obama's comments. \"Now is the time to use logic and ask ourselves, why do we have a Constitution? Why do we have a Second Amendment? They\u2019re always saying you don't need a high-powered weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting. It's about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion.\"\n\nAsked what he would say as president, Carson said he would ask the country to \"imagine 24 or 48 hours with no police. What would your life be like?\"\n\n\"Yes, there are some bad apples and, yes, we will find ways to deal with them but in no way do we indict the entire police force,\" Carson said.\n\nAddressing the killing of five officers, in addition to seven more wounded, Carson noted that \"there are terror cells\" and \"professional agitators all over our country looking for opportunities.\"\n\n\"And these opportunities do arise. They will continue to arise because, you know, there are bad apples in the police force like there are bad apples in everything. There are bad surgeons,\" the retired neurosurgeon said. \"But the vast majority of surgeons are wonderful people. So, you know, these opportunities will continue to happen and they will continue to do these things. But I guess the real issue is, you know, the president's going to start saying, see, gun control.\"\n\nRep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), whose district encompasses parts of northeast Dallas, affirmed his support for Trump and criticized the man currently in the White House for \"weakness\" and for being abxentabsence from the United States.\n\n\"We'll go with great resolve to Cleveland. Donald Trump will be there and be nominated and we must stand and be strong about making America great again,\" Sessions told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"If we are weak at home, we are weak around the world and this is an example of a weakness when our president goes overseas and has a terrible tragedy like this is an idea why we've got to solve ourself.\"\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, meanwhile, told Fox News that he would have preferred Obama react to the shootings more like President Ronald Reagan assuaged the nation following the Challenger space disaster in 1986.\n\n\"He doesn't need to inject the divisive arguments like gun control at a time of great grief for the nation. And he ought to do for us what Ronald Reagan did after the Challenger disaster,\" Huckabee said. \"And that's remind us of what we have in common, not what separates us. And that's why I'm always so frustrated. Barack Obama has such great potential to be a leader. But on the other hand, what he ought to be doing is focusing upon those police officers and the sacrifice they made and solely on the police officers and the sacrifices of their family and leave all of the political discussions aside. There's plenty of time for that. Today there's one thing ought on the president's mind.\"\n\nOn the same program, Colorado Republican Senate candidate Darryl Glenn suggested that the president needs \u201cto be very careful not to get too far ahead of the facts, but you need to be careful not to drive your policy agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause what you're going to do is you're going to exacerbate the issue by driving a wedge, especially a wedge between law enforcement and the people that they're there to protect,\u201d Glenn continued, suggesting that this is \u201can excellent opportunity\u201d to bring together policymakers, law enforcement and community leaders. \u201cBecause we need to grieve together because we're family members. And you need to make sure that the information you're putting out there is factual. Not policy based.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, widely seen as a leading contender to be Trump's vice presidential pick, told \"Fox & Friends\" that Obama has failed to bring the country together in his nearly eight years in office.\n\n\"Gun control is the obvious,\" he said. \"Look, first of all, our hearts have to go out to families. The families of the police officers in Dallas. The families in Baton Rouge. The families in Minneapolis. This has been a terrible couple of days for America, and it should be a wake-up call that there's some things that are profoundly wrong in this country right now. And they deserve an honest, open conversation or it's just going to get worse.\"\n\nAppearing later in the morning on Fox News, William Johnson, the executive director of National Association of Police Organizations, was asked whether law enforcement feels \"increasingly under siege and targeted.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. It's a horrible day. It's a war on cops,\" Johnson responded. \"And the Obama administration is the Neville Chamberlain of this war. I think their continued appeasement at the federal level with the Department of Justice, their appeasement of violent criminals, their refusal to condemn movements like Black Lives Matter, actively calling for the death of police officers, that type of thing, all the while blaming police for the problems in this country has led directly to the climate that has made Dallas possible.\"\n\nRep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) decried in a statement what he characterized as the \"spread of misinformation and constant instigation by prominent leaders, including our president\" who, he added, \"contributed to the modern day hostility we are witnessing between the police and those they serve. As a result, today we are seeing one of the noblest professions condemned by those who could benefit the most.\"\n\nTaking a more measured tone, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) laid the blame for the shooting squarely in the hands of the perpetrators, while also suggesting that Obama, along with other public officials, including himself, take a look in the mirror.\n\n\"I think all of us in public life, the president included, should re-examine everything we\u2019ve said, everything we\u2019ve done up to this point to see if in our public discourse we\u2019ve contributed in any way,\" Rubio told reporters in Washington, adding, \"I think all of us need to re-examine constantly in this country and whether it contributes to the nation moving forward or whether sometimes we're unnecessarily pitting people against each other. And I hold myself to that standard as well.\"\n\nOn Thursday, before the Dallas shootings, Obama tried to strike a balance as he talked about anger and grief in the African-American community after the latest killings by police and the feeling among some law enforcement officials that Obama has not always supported them.\n\n\u201cTo be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201dWhen people say black lives matter, it doesn\u2019t mean blue lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201607/1705/1155968404_5027749177001_5027733577001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "title": "GOP rips Obama after Dallas shooting", "summary": "GOP rips Obama after Dallas shooting 'Now is definitely not the time to get political,' Ben Carson says.\n\u201cTo be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\"Appearing later in the morning on Fox News, William Johnson, the executive director of National Association of Police Organizations, was asked whether law enforcement feels \"increasingly under siege and targeted.\n\"On Thursday, before the Dallas shootings, Obama tried to strike a balance as he talked about anger and grief in the African-American community after the latest killings by police and the feeling among some law enforcement officials that Obama has not always supported them.\n\"Story Continued BelowBen Carson lit into Obama within the first hour after his remarks.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Nick Gass", "Brent Griffiths", "Annie Karni", "Shane Goldmacher"], "keywords": ["enforcement", "law", "dallas", "country", "told", "officers", "rips", "going", "need", "president", "shooting", "gop", "obama"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-08 00:00:00", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/07/08/black-lives-matter-protest-devolves-into-one-of-the-worst-attacks-on-law-enforcement-in-100-years-n2189789", "text": "Christine wrote about the tragic event that took place in Dallas, Texas last night.

The toll could rise, as Dallas police said at least seven other officers were wounded, including two who were in critical condition.\n\nIt\u2019s a ghastly scene. There is footage, which I will not link, of one of the alleged shooters shooting a police officer. During a press conference in the early morning hours, Police Chief David Brown said that three suspects, one female, two male, are in custody. There was a fourth suspect that was held up at the El Centro College parking garage, where he threatened to kill more cops, saying that the end was near, and that there were bombs all over the complex. He exchanged gunfire with law enforcement as they tried to negotiate an end to the situation. The police eventually killed him with a bomb robot. No bombs were found in the immediate area.\n\nMORE: Fourth #Dallas shooting suspect was killed by bomb robot, police chief says https://t.co/4DsbZ0ixwD pic.twitter.com/UwGp9a4gS1 \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) July 8, 2016\n\nThe White House and The Texas Governor\u2019s Office have contacted Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to extend their assistance.

He repeated the statements during a Wednesday morning press conference saying, \u201cI think the DNI, Clapper, should deny Hillary Clinton access to classified information during this campaign, given how she so recklessly handled classified information.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s point one. Point two, Director Comey\u2019s presentation shredded the claims that Secretary Clinton made throughout the year with respect to this issue. He laid out a case, how the things she had been saying she had or had not done were false. So we have seen nothing but stonewalling and dishonesty from Secretary Clinton on this issue and that means there are a lot more questions that need to be answered.\u201d\n\nRyan went on to point out that presidential candidates get \u201caccess to deeply classified material once you leave the convention as the nominee.\u201d \u201cWith no indictment occurring but with a call for administrative action, I think it\u2019s the least we can do given how she was so reckless in handling classified material,\u201d Ryan added.\n\nThe call for administrative action was apparently a reference to a statement made by Director Comey Tuesday after he announced he would not be recommending prosecution:\n\nTo be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest rejected Speaker Ryan\u2019s call for accountability for Clinton. The Hill reports:\n\n\u201cWhat the Office of the Director of National Intelligence [DNI] has indicated is that they expect those briefings to move forward after the party conventions,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cAnd the expectation that the DNI has is that they\u2019ll provide the same information to both candidates,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should leave those decisions in the hands of our intelligence professionals and not risk them being sullied by the political debate.\u201d\n\nYou have to appreciate the sheer audacity of this statement. Earnest is suggesting we wouldn\u2019t want politics to interfere in the handling of classified intelligence. We\u2019re supposed to put out of our minds that she did exactly that for 4 years as Secretary with her private server that kept all of her email out of reach of FOIA requests. We\u2019re also supposed to forget that she and her campaign have been lying outlandishly for more than a year, all of it clearly in the service of her political ambitions.

While announcing that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton for her handling of classified material on nonsecure personal email servers, Mr. Comey issued a strong rebuke of her practices, which he called \u201cextremely careless\u201d \u2014 and for which she has never given the public a full explanation. He was right on both points.\n\nMr. Comey explained that there was no clear evidence Mrs. Clinton or her colleagues had intentionally broken any federal laws on classified information, and he said that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would pursue an indictment in the case.\n\nThis legal decision is undoubtedly correct. The F.B.I. investigation, which began a year ago, examined tens of thousands of emails sent to and from Mrs. Clinton during her leadership of the State Department. It found that eight email threads contained information that was classified \u201ctop secret\u201d at the time, the highest classification level. Several dozen more contained information that was either \u201csecret\u201d or \u201cconfidential,\u201d the lowest level.\n\nFor at least two reasons, Mr. Comey said, this did not amount to criminal wrongdoing. First was the lack of evidence that Mrs. Clinton or her colleagues had intended to break any laws. Second, prosecutions of similar cases in the past have relied on some combination of elements that were missing in this case: the intentional mishandling of classified information, indications of disloyalty to the United States, and efforts to obstruct justice.\n\nBut Mr. Comey was clear that while these email habits weren\u2019t criminal, Mrs. Clinton and her staff were \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d He added that \u201cany reasonable person\u201d in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s position should have known that she was playing with fire.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

She did.\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cNone of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps more troubling was the F.B.I.\u2019s finding that Mrs. Clinton \u201calso used her personal email extensively while abroad, including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries,\u201d adding that \u201cit is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email account.\u201d\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s conclusions \u2014 legal recommendation aside \u2014 can be seen as nothing less than a censure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s judgment. Of course, his recommendation was met with howls from the right, and particularly from Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who wasted no time trying to delegitimize the F.B.I.\u2019s work by claiming it was only more proof that \u201cthe system is rigged.\u201d But to assume that the F.B.I. somehow worked on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behalf betrays a basic misunderstanding of the way the agency functions, and views its own mission. Led by Mr. Comey, who also served as deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush, the F.B.I. appears to have worked as comprehensively and expediently as it could to investigate a problem that is entirely of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s making.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s desire to shield her private communications from public scrutiny may be understandable to supporters of her presidential campaign. But in leading one of the most sensitive departments in the federal government, she did little to improve what Mr. Comey called \u201cthe security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified email systems in particular,\u201d that \u201cwas generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government.\u201d\n\nAs Mrs. Clinton said in the past, and her campaign reiterated on Tuesday, her decision to use private email was a mistake. She remains, far and away, the most experienced and knowledgeable candidate for the presidency, particularly when compared with Mr. Trump. But she has done damage to her reputation by failing to conform to the established security policies of the department she ran and by giving evasive or misleading answers about her actions and motivations.

The Obama administration's anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her\n\npath and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination.\"\n\nDespite not recommending charges be brought against Clinton, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of her actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information.\n\nHe added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.\n\n\"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" he said.\n\nComey said seven email chains were classified at the \u201cTop Secret/Special Access Program level\u201d when they were sent and received on Clinton\u2019s server.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton\u2019s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\u201d Comey said.\n\nTuesday's decision helps remove what was arguably the biggest threat to her presidential campaign going forward \u2013 a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment \u2013 just weeks before her party\u2019s national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer.\n\nClinton consistently had downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a \u201csecurity review,\u201d and as recently as June 3 said there was \u201cabsolutely no possibility\u201d she\u2019d be indicted. Weeks ago, a scathing State Department inspector general report directly countered her long-running claim that her personal email use was allowed, though her campaign continued to defend the candidate\u2019s actions.\n\nIn the wake of that report, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, stepped up his criticism of her email actions and said she belongs in \u201cjail.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ decision does not strip the email controversy as a campaign issue \u2013 Trump and the Republicans are sure to keep hammering it as the campaign lurches into full general election mode post-conventions \u2013 but shows the federal investigation did not determine the actions to be criminal, even if they were ill-advised and potentially damaging to national security.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the decision not to prosecute Clinton defied explanation, adding: \"No one should be above the law.\"\n\nThe decision comes more than a year after knowledge of Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account and server first became public. Clinton responded at the time with a point-by-point written explanation and a press conference in which she said she had opted to use her personal server for \u201cconvenience.\u201d\n\nBut critics said she was clearly circumventing government systems in order to try to shield her communications from public records requests, potentially putting sensitive and highly classified government secrets at risk in the process.\n\nDuring a subsequent review, more than 2,000 emails on the server were found to have contained information now deemed classified, though they apparently were not marked classified when sent.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/07/05/0/0/694940094001_5022318623001_c1c00b79-fb75-48da-b0c2-b581b3c383bb.jpg?ve=1", "title": "FBI\u2019s Comey: Clinton 'extremely careless' about emails, but bureau will not advise criminal charges", "summary": "He added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.\n\"As the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again.\nTrump later issued two seperate statements on the matter including one that in part read: \"Comey let Clinton off the hook.\n\"Despite not recommending charges be brought against Clinton, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of her actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information.\n\"The decision comes more than a year after knowledge of Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account and server first became public.", "source": "Fox News", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": [], "keywords": ["secretary", "clinton", "comey", "charges", "fbis", "decision", "classified", "server", "personal", "email", "bureau", "national", "careless", "advise", "criminal", "extremely", "emails", "trump"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-05 06:00:03-04:00", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/286286-decision-time-for-trump-on-vp", "text": "It\u2019s decision time for Donald Trump Donald TrumpWarren says she'll oppose Trump's Supreme Court nominee Pelosi slams Trump: Travel ban shows administration is \u2018incompetent\u2019 Schumer: I have 'serious doubts' about Trump's Supreme Court nominee MORE and for the potential vice presidential candidates considering whether to hitch their political futures to his renegade campaign.\n\n\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee has said he plans to announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month. It would be the first time in nearly 20 years that a vice president was unveiled in the middle of a convention.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat gives Trump at most about two weeks to wrap-up the vetting process, secure his candidate and become comfortable with a running mate who is about to have his or her life upended by the most volatile presidential election in modern times.The media frenzy surrounding Trump\u2019s VP selection will reach a fever pitch if he makes the announcement inside of Quicken Loans Arena in a made-for-TV spectacle along the lines of one of his beauty pageants or reality television shows.\u201cThe art of theater is going to infuse this convention in a way it never has before,\u201d said GOP strategist Phil Musser. \u201cYou have to expect the decision around the timing of the announcement will be consistent with how he has been able to maximize the number eyeballs on him at every turn. He\u2019s the master of that.\u201dIn recent history, presumptive nominees have announced their running mates in the days or weeks leading up to their party\u2019s convention. It\u2019s a tone-setter that lays the groundwork for the convention to serve as a slingshot into the general election, rather than a tense series of events that are shrouded in mystery.But Trump and his surrogates have insistedpublicly that he\u2019ll announce his running mate at the convention.The last time that happened was in 1988, when George H.W. Bush shocked the political world by announcing he\u2019d selected Dan Quayle, at the time a 41-year-old senator from Indiana, over better known senators like Bob Dole (Kan.) and Jack Kemp (N.Y.).Bush made the surprise announcement from a riverboat docked on the Mississippi River in New Orleans on the second day of the GOP convention.Bush himself hadbeen a surprise pick on the floor of the convention in Detroit in 1980, when Ronald Reagan settled for him after failing to come to terms with Gerald Ford.Mitt Romney announcedas his running mate about three weeks before the GOP convention in 2012.In 2008, President Obama tappedtwo days before their convention.announced Sarah Palin in the immediate aftermath of the Democratic convention that year, just days before the GOP convention got underway.The Trump campaign could still trot out their vice presidential pick earlier if they see a political benefit in it.Trump will enter the convention trailing in the polls and in fundraising. He is getting clobbered by pro-Clinton forces on the airwaves in battleground states.Many high-profile Republicans refuse to support him and will not attend the convention. There is concern in some quarters that Trump is not running a serious campaign and that he will cost the party the Senate majority.An early announcement could energize activists and allay the fears of panicked Republicans who worry that the party faces a chaotic convention and a bloodbath in the fall.\u201cTrump desperately needs to turn the campaign narrative around in his favor or at least change the current focus on his falling poll numbers, lack of fundraising and general inability to project seriousness,\u201d said GOP strategist David Payne. \u201cIf he were to make a smart pick for VP, it could be his best campaign move in months.\u201dBut the timing is secondary to the person Trump ends up selecting.Maine Sen.(R) has gone so far as to say that her endorsement of Trump will hinge on whether she supports his vice presidential nominee.Trump\u2019s pick will either satisfy critics who are concerned about his judgment or raise new questions about his temperament for office.It could serve as an olive branch to mainstream Republicans who believe he lacks policy acumen or act as a declaration that he intends to buck the establishment every step of the way.The pick could help Trump shore up deficiencies with women and minorities or signal that his campaign views a certain region or state as critical to their prospects.\u201cThe VP selection is Trump's first big decision since becoming the nominee and will show the American people his decision-making process,\u201d said U.S. Chamber of Commerce political analyst Scott Reed.That process is primarily driven by Trump\u2019s gut instinct, which adds an additional layer of intrigue.Trump is known to prize loyalty and the input of those who make it into his inner circle, fueling talk that the leading vice presidential contenders are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Alabama Sen.and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.Trump is outperformingamong white men but trails in almost every other demographic. That could put retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer or Tennessee Rep.in play.Trump would benefit from the gravitas and policy expertise of well-respected conservatives like Tennessee Sen., Indiana Gov. Mike Pence or Ohio Gov. John Kasich.And there are wildcard picks in play, like former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown or perhaps an Army general with lower name recognition.Trump\u2019s universe of potential candidates may be limited because some will be hesitant to join the ticket over fears that they\u2019ll be shunned by party elites or that the campaign is a doomed causethat will hurt their career.The vice presidential candidate will have to answer for Trump\u2019s most controversial statements and will need to be capable of handling a media environment where every utterance can make news.\u201cIt's risky to hitch their wagon to Trump's team of renegade horses,\u201d Payne said. \u201cIt will take someone willing to accept the risk of losing badly in November.\u201dBut no matter who Trump chooses, his running mate is unlikely to decide the election.\u201cThis election will be about Donald Trump, not the VP,\u201d Musser said. \u201cThe VP will contribute on the margins, but the personality at the top of the ticket will drive people\u2019s decision making.

(Reuters)\n\nFBI agents interviewed Hillary Clinton for 3\u00bd hours Saturday morning \u2014 a signal that the investigation into her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state is drawing to a close.\n\nClinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement Saturday that Clinton \u201cgave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was Secretary,\u201d and added, \u201cShe is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nAsked if the interview, which took place at FBI headquarters, was businesslike and civil, Clinton told MSNBC that it was \u201cboth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was something I had offered to do since last August,\u201d she said, according to a transcript provided by the network. \u201cI\u2019ve been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nAs she has in the past, Clinton asserted that she \u201cnever received nor sent any material that was marked classified,\u201d although she said that some might have been retroactively branded classified during the process to prepare it for public release. She said she had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the investigators\u2019 timeline.\n\nThe investigation is not over: Agents and prosecutors will now have to compare what the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Saturday to other evidence they have gathered, including from interviews with Clinton\u2019s aides. They will also have to analyze how the facts of the case apply to various laws that might have been violated.\n\nBut officials familiar with the probe and legal analysts have said a meeting with Clinton would be reserved for the end of the investigation.\n\n[How Clinton\u2019s email scandal took root]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a signal that they\u2019re wrapping things up,\u201d said Justin Shur, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section who is now in private practice at the MoloLamken firm.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the Clinton interview.\n\nThe past week has been tumultuous for Clinton and the government\u2019s investigation into whether her email system might have compromised classified information. On Monday, former president Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting with U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch aboard Lynch\u2019s plane at an airport in Phoenix. Lynch asserted they did not discuss any pending investigations, but the conversation sparked an uproar \u2014 with some Republicans and Clinton rivals calling for a third party to be appointed to handle the case.\n\nReferring to that meeting, Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that \u201chindsight is 20/20\u201d and said her husband, like the attorney general, would probably not do it again.\n\n1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Takeaways from Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails View Photos Clinton has come under fire for using a private e-mail address during her time as secretary of state.

Caption Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state. The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we\u2019ve learned from them. Top-secret information in e-mails Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has previously stated that classified information never traveled across her private server. However, the State Department has acknowledged that \"top secret\" information was in seven email chains sent or received by her. Richard Drew/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\n[Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch just made Hillary\u2019s email problems even worse]\n\nOn Friday, Lynch announced that she would accept recommendations from career prosecutors and FBI agents leading the probe \u2014 a decision that she said had been made before her meeting with Bill Clinton, but one that was surely meant to quiet criticism about the independence of the probe. While Lynch did not formally recuse herself from the investigation involving Hillary Clinton\u2019s email \u2014 saying that \u201cwould mean I wouldn\u2019t even be briefed on what the findings were\u201d \u2014 she seemed to promise she would not veto whatever decision came from federal prosecutors handling the case.\n\nIt is not clear who precisely will be the ultimate decision-maker, if Lynch will serve as more of a rubber stamp. The attorney general said FBI Director James B. Comey would be among those involved.\n\nThe investigation is focused on whether classified information was mishandled because Clinton used a private email account when she was secretary of state. The State Department\u2019s inspector general has already issued a report highly critical of Clinton\u2019s email practices, asserting that she failed to seek legal approval to use a private server and that staffers would not have assented if they were asked. The inspector general also found that Clinton\u2019s email setup was \u201cnot an appropriate method\u201d for preserving public records.\n\nA Washington Post analysis of Clinton\u2019s publicly released correspondence found that Clinton wrote 104 emails that she sent using her private server while secretary of state that the government has since said contained classified information. But the review also found that using non-secure email systems to send sensitive information was widespread at the department and elsewhere in government and that Clinton\u2019s publicly released correspondence included classified emails written by about 300 other people inside and outside the government.\n\nPeople familiar with the case have said previously that charges against Clinton seemed unlikely and that there was a particular void of evidence showing she intended to mishandle classified information, although they asserted investigators were still probing the matter aggressively. The interview with Clinton was always seen as critical. If the former secretary was untruthful with investigators, she could be charged with making false statements. That charge was contemplated in the case against retired Army general and former CIA director David H. Petraeus, although he ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information.\n\nWith the Republican and Democratic conventions looming later this month, timing has also become a complicating factor. Justice Department guidelines specifically warn prosecutors against selecting the timing of investigative steps for the purpose of affecting an election or helping a particular candidate or party.\n\nAdam Goldman contributed to this report.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/07/02/National-Politics/Images/DEM_2016_Clinton-a21a3.jpg", "title": "FBI interviews Hillary Clinton for more than 3 hours in email probe", "summary": "Top-secret information in e-mails Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has previously stated that classified information never traveled across her private server.\nReferring to that meeting, Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that \u201chindsight is 20/20\u201d and said her husband, like the attorney general, would probably not do it again.\nThe inspector general also found that Clinton\u2019s email setup was \u201cnot an appropriate method\u201d for preserving public records.\n(Reuters)Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton met with federal investigators probing her use of a private email account while serving as secretary of state, according to her campaign.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton met with federal investigators probing her use of a private email account while serving as secretary of state, according to her campaign.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post's National Security Team", "Anne Gearan Is A National Politics Correspondent For The Washington Post"], "keywords": ["information", "classified", "clinton", "interviews", "probe", "state", "private", "hours", "hillary", "lynch", "fbi", "secretary", "email", "clintons"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-07-02 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/02/at-least-6-islamist-militants-killed-13-hostages-rescued-after-commando-raid-on-bangladesh-restaurant.html", "text": "An American was one of the victims in the 10-hour hostage crisis at a Bangladesh caf\u00e9 that left 22 dead.\n\nThe State Department confirmed Saturday that a U.S. citizen was among those \u201csenselessly murdered\u201d when Islamic terrorists stormed the restaurant in the diplomatic quater of the Bangladesh capita, Dhaka.

See more videos\n\nIn an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Friday morning, Lynch conceded the meeting hurt the Justice Department\u2019s reputation by creating an appearance of impropriety, though she insisted she did not discuss the case with the former president.\n\nShe also announced that she would abide by the recommendations of career prosecutors and FBI Director James Comey about how to proceed with the email investigation and whether to file any charges.\n\n\"I will be accepting their recommendations and their plan going forward,\u201d she said, adding that she felt bad that the meeting has \u201ccast a shadow over how people are going to view that work, something I take seriously.\u201d\n\nLynch and other Justice Department officials said she had already decided to abide by prosecutors\u2019 and the FBI\u2019s recommendation in the case. Given Lynch\u2019s background as a career prosecutor, it was unlikely that she would have use her authority to overrule the FBI anyway, an action that would have undoubtedly leaked and triggered a political backlash.\n\nBut the poor appearance surrounding the meeting with Bill Clinton led Lynch to publicly announce her decision in an attempt to quell the controversy and restore public faith in the probe.\n\nThe attorney general, who served twice as the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., before taking the reins of the Justice Department in April 2015, stopped short of formally recusing herself from the case, telling Washington Post journalist Jonathan Capehart that doing so would prevent her from even being briefed on its findings by agents and prosecutors.\n\nJustice Department political appointees often find themselves in difficult situations when they investigate high-profile and political figures. President Nixon infamously triggered the 1973 resignations of his attorney general and deputy attorney general when he demanded the firing of a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.\n\nMore recently, FBI officials expressed private frustration that top Justice Department officials permitted David Petraeus, the former Army general and CIA director, to plead guilty to a misdemeanor for disclosing classified information to his mistress, who was writing a book about him, while he headed the intelligence agency. They had hoped to see Petraeus prosecuted on felony charges, but Justice Department prosecutors, including then-Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. , believed that the case would be messy and difficult to win and agreed to allow Petraeus to plead to a lesser misdemeanor.\n\nTRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign \u00bb\n\nIn their investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, FBI agents and prosecutors are trying to understand whether classified material was knowingly or negligently discussed over the private system.\n\nThe controversy was that latest reminder that the email probe continues to dog Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. A final decision on the probe is not expected for several weeks.\n\nThe meeting with Bill Clinton appears to have been a coincidence. The former president, who was departing the airport on a private jet, noticed Lynch\u2019s plane had arrived and decided to go over and say hello, said a person familiar with the meeting. He then boarded and spoke with Lynch and her husband, Stephen Hargrove, who had joined the attorney general on her trip.\n\nLynch said Tuesday that the meeting was personal and did not delve into the email investigation.\n\n\u201cOur conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren,\u201d Lynch told reporters in Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cIt was primarily social and about our travels. He mentioned the golf he played in Phoenix, and he mentioned travels he\u2019d had in West Virginia. We talked about former attorney general Janet Reno, for example, whom we both know, but there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body.\u201d\n\nSee the most-read stories this hour >>\n\nDespite her assurances, Lynch was blasted by Republicans, who said it raised questions about her fairness in overseeing the probe. Democrats expressed frustration that the former president would put the attorney general in such a position.\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, promised to seek answers about the meeting at an oversight hearing next month.\n\n\u201cAtty. Gen. Lynch\u2019s private meeting with Bill Clinton raises many questions about the investigation into Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas issued a statement Thursday reiterating his earlier call for a special prosecutor to over see the case because \u201cthis incident does nothing to instill confidence in the American people that her department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation.\u201d\n\nFormer Justice Department lawyers and law professors said Lynch has the reputation of being a straight-shooter and a by-the-book prosecutor, and were surprised that she allowed Bill Clinton onto her plane.\n\n\u201cIt was unfortunate and she has admitted that the optics were not good in retrospect,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, adding that she had mitigated some of the fallout by deferring the decision on filing charges to Comey and career prosecutors.\n\nTobias and others noted that the FBI director served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and was known for not being timid about standing up to the White House.\n\n\u201cComey enjoys a sterling reputation for addressing complex, difficult situations that arose in the Bush years,\u201d Tobias said.\n\nALSO\n\nObama: Donald Trump's rhetoric is 'nativism.

Their families were close. But the EU referendum ripped through old loyalties.\n\nFirst Michael Gove backed the Leave campaign, knowing the damage it could do to Cameron and Osborne. The chancellor and Gove kept their friendship intact despite the strain of the campaign.\n\nBut it was Boris Johnson's decision to lead the Leave campaign and put his own ambitions to be prime minister ahead of loyalty to David Cameron that severed his relationship with the now departing PM, destroyed by Leave's victory.\n\nBoris Johnson believed the crown would be his and naively believed Michael Gove's promises of support. But now Mr Gove, despite polite protestations he never coveted the top job, has ruthlessly dispatched his friend.\n\nWhat has been going on behind the scenes? The truth will only emerge in memoirs.\n\nBut my sense is Mr Gove and his team of advisors clearly did not believe Boris Johnson had the spine to fully divorce Britain from the EU. Nor did a number of Tory Mps trust Mr Johnson to deliver the promises he was making in terms of personnel and jobs.\n\nWhen Mr Gove made his move, hardened Brexit believers instantly went with him, sinking Boris Johnson.\n\nThe irony of course is that Boris Johnson, who did so much to take Britain out of the EU, has seen his own ambitious crushed in the aftermath.\n\nIt could be that the big winner from this vicious Tory drama is the woman in charge of law and order - Theresa May.\n\nSetting out his pitch for the leadership, the cabinet minister - best known as a controversial education secretary before becoming one of the faces of the Leave campaign - said: \"I want there to be an open and positive debate about the path the country will now take.\n\n\"Whatever the verdict of that debate I will respect it. In the next few days I will lay out my plan for the United Kingdom which I hope can provide unity and change.\"\n\nConservative MP David Davis told BBC Radio 5 Live Mr Gove's decision must have been taken \"very late\", as Mr Gove's assistant had asked him on Wednesday night to attend Mr Johnson's campaign launch on Thursday.\n\nJustice minister and Leave campaigner Dominic Raab, who switched his support from Mr Johnson to Mr Gove, told the BBC's Daily Politics that \"Boris was cavalier with assurances he made\" and had failed to put together a \"strong unifying team\".\n\nWho's in the running?\n\nHome Secretary Theresa May: The 59-year-old has overtaken Boris Johnson as the bookies' favourite to win the contest. She's held the Home Office brief - often something of a poisoned chalice - since 2010, and is a former Tory party chairman. She says she can offer the \"strong leadership\" and unity the UK needs, and promised a \"positive vision\" for the country's future. She backed staying in the EU.\n\nJustice Secretary Michael Gove: The 48-year-old former newspaper columnist was a key figure in the party's modernisation that led to its return to power in 2010. He was a reforming, if controversial, education secretary between 2010 and 2014, and now holds the Ministry of Justice brief. He was a leading player in the Brexit campaign - which put a strain on his close friendship with David Cameron. He has pitched himself as the candidate that can provide \"unity and change.\"\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb: The 43-year-old was promoted to the cabinet in 2014 as Welsh secretary, and boosted his profile earlier this year when he took over as work and pensions secretary. A rising star of the Tory party he has promised to unite the party and country following the referendum result and provide stability. Raised on a council estate by a single mother, he has a back story to which many Tory MPs are attracted. Backed Remain.\n\nEnergy minister Andrea Leadsom: The 53-year-old former banker and fund manager was one of the stars of the Leave campaign. A former district councillor, she became MP for South Northamptonshire in 2010 and - after serving as a junior Treasury minister and as a member of the Treasury select committee - she was made a junior minister in the energy and climate change department in May last year.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Liam Fox: It's second time around for the 54-year-old ex-defence secretary and GP, who came a close third in the 2005 leadership contest. His cabinet career was cut short in 2011 when he resigned following a lobbying row. A Brexit campaigner, and on the right of the party, he has said whoever becomes PM must accept \"the instruction\" of the British people and not \"try to backslide\" over EU membership.\n\nLaunching her leadership bid in central London, Mrs May - one of the longest-serving home secretaries in history - said the UK needed \"strong proven leadership to steer us through this period of economic and political uncertainty and to negotiate the best possible terms as we leave the European Union\".\n\nShe also pitched herself as the candidate that could \"unite our party and our country\" and offer \"a bold, new positive vision\" for the country's future that \"works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us\".\n\nAlthough Mrs May - the daughter of a vicar - backed Remain she maintained a low profile during the campaign and, in her speech, insisted she would not back away from last week's vote. \"Brexit is Brexit.\"\n\nBut she said Article 50 - the formal mechanism for leaving the EU - should not be triggered until the UK had agreed its negotiating strategy - probably before the end of year.\n\nShe set out plans for a new government department to oversee the UK's withdrawal from the EU - and said it would be headed by a pro-Brexit cabinet-level minister.\n\nAnd she said she would, as prime minister, abandon plans to pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights, saying she did not expect there to be a parliamentary majority for it.\n\nMrs May acknowledged she was \"not a showy politician\", adding: \"I just get on with the job in front of me\" - suggesting that was what the country wanted.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Andrea Leadsom, Stephen Crabb and Liam Fox are also in the running\n\nFormer Defence Secretary Liam Fox, meanwhile, said any Brexit deal which included free movement of people would be \"a betrayal\" of the referendum result, as he kicked off his campaign.\n\nHe said free movement was a political preference which needed to challenged. And he said the UK should approach the post-EU era with \"confidence\".\n\nEnergy minister Andrea Leadsom, who also announced her candidacy on Thursday, told the BBC that delivering Brexit was an \"absolutely top priority\" for the next prime minister.\n\n\"It's not just about leaving something, it's about re-engaging with the rest of the world,\" she said.\n\nShe also said she had a \"real desire to see the social justice in our country turned around\" and said her focus, if elected, would be on mental health, improving skills and getting young people into work.\n\nMedia caption Boris Johnson bows out: Londoners give their verdict\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb, who was the first to launch his leadership bid and who campaigned to stay in the EU, vowed to make curbing immigration a \"red line\" in Brexit negotiations - and he ruled out a snap general election and a second EU referendum.\n\nThe former Welsh secretary said stability was his aim. He also pledged to confront economic and social divisions across the UK, build a strong economy and improve trade links, if he won the contest.\n\nSpeaking before Mr Johnson's decision to pull out Mrs May joked: \"Boris negotiated in Europe. I seem to remember last time he did a deal with the Germans, he came back with three nearly-new water cannon.\"\n\nThe then London mayor purchased the riot control water cannon following the riots in the capital city in 2011 - but Mrs May eventually withheld permission for their use.\n\nIn a speech that had been billed as his campaign launch on Thursday, Mr Johnson, who has long harboured ambitions to be leader and prime minister, announced he would not be standing.\n\nMr Johnson said the next Conservative leader would have to unify his party and ensure that Britain stood tall in the world.\n\n\"Having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in Parliament, I have concluded that person cannot be me,\" he said, just moments before the noon deadline passed.", "image": "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1B18/production/_90163960_033314905-1.jpg", "title": "Michael Gove and Theresa May head five-way Conservative race", "summary": "Image copyright Various Image caption Michael Gove and Theresa May lead the field as Boris Johnson bows outJustice Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May lead a five-way race to be the next Conservative Party leader and UK prime minister.\nRemember this: David Cameron, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and George Osborne grew up together - personally and politically.\nMr Johnson said the next Conservative leader would have to unify his party and ensure that Britain stood tall in the world.\nMr Gove was a surprise addition to the race, having been expected to back Boris Johnson, who shocked the political world by ruling himself out.\nBut now Mr Gove, despite polite protestations he never coveted the top job, has ruthlessly dispatched his friend.", "source": "BBC News", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": [], "keywords": ["boris", "head", "johnson", "gove", "michael", "fiveway", "theresa", "leave", "caption", "race", "minister", "leadership", "mr", "eu", "conservative", "secretary"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-06-29 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/06/29/istanbul-airport-reopens-after-terror-attack-leaves-41-dead-239-injured.html?intcmp=hpbt1", "text": "The coordinated massacre at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport came into clearer focus Wednesday as officials revealed a more detailed timeline of the terror attack that killed 42 and wounded 238.\n\nAfter the three attackers arrived at the Turkish transit hub via taxi on Tuesday, one of the assailants entered the terminal, began shooting people and then blew himself up near X-ray machines, officials said. During the chaos, a second attacker rushed to the departures level and detonated his explosives. The third attacker waited outside during the entire episode, blowing himself up as scared travelers frantically flooded out of the airport.\n\n\n\n\"When the terrorists couldn't pass the regular security system, when they couldn't pass the scanners, police and security controls, they returned and took out their weapons out of their suitcases and opened fire at random at the security check,\" Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral U.S. airports strengthened security measures due to the carnage in Istanbul, and, adding to the tension, a terminal at JFK Airport in New York was evacuated for a brief period Wednesday when a suspicious bag was spotted. It was later determined the unattended bag posed no threat and travelers were allowed back in the terminal.\n\nAuthorities viewed ISIS as the most likely culprit in the Istanbul attack, as the Turkey assault bore hallmarks similar to the March 22 coordinated terror attacks in Brussels, in which ISIS operatives killed 32 in coordinated bombings at Zaventem airport and a nearby metro station. But ISIS had not taken credit for Tuesday's attacks, and Ankara has battled Kurdish militants as well as ISIS.\n\nTurkish officials told The Associated Press and Reuters that ISIS was the primary suspect, however, and the Islamic State released an infographic Wednesday in which it claimed to have \"covert\" units in Turkey. The infographic, sent out via ISIS' Amaq news agency, was made to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the militants establishing their so-called caliphate in areas of Syria and Iraq.\n\nA U.S. government official told Fox News that the attack fits the profile of ISIS, which has stepped up its targeting of Turkey. The official said ISIS tends to attack internationally known targets with an economic impact, such as an airport, while the Kurdish terror group PKK generally targets Turkish military and law enforcement.\n\n\"If this Islamic State is indeed behind this attack, this would be a declaration of war,\" Analyst Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at The Washington Institute, told AFP. \"Turkey's vengeance will come down like rain from hell on the Islamic State.\"\n\nOf the 238 people injured in the carnage, 109 had already been discharged from the hospital Wednesday morning, The Istanbul Governor's Office said. The Turkish Health Minister said 40 people remained in intensive care.\n\nMost of those killed were Turkish, officials said. The 14 foreign travelers killed included six Saudis, two Iraqis and citizens from China, Iran, Jordan, Tunisia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, Reuters reported.\n\nThe assault began when one attacker blew himself up outside the Ataturk terminal, the Haber Turk newspaper reported. Two other terrorists then opened fire at a point where X-ray machines are located.\n\n\"He's shooting up, two times, and he's beginning to shoot people like that, like he was walking like a prophet,\" Otfah Mohamed Abdullah, who witnessed one of the attackers, told AFPTV.\n\n\n\nOne attacker was shot at while running amid fleeing passengers, then blew himself up at an exit. The third attacker went up one level to where the international departures terminal is, was shot by police and blew himself up.\n\nA Turkish official told The Associated Press that authorities were going through CCTV footage and eyewitness statements to establish a more detailed timeline of the attack. \"It is a jigsaw puzzle\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol.\n\nAirport surveillance video posted on social media showed the moment of one blast, a huge ball of fire, and passengers fleeing in terror. Another appeared to show an attacker, felled by a gunshot from a security officer, blowing himself up seconds later.\n\nThe recent attacks on Turkey, a key partner in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and a NATO member, have increased in scale and frequency. They have scared away tourists and hurt the Turkish economy, which relies heavily on tourism.\n\nHundreds of passengers who fled the airport in fear were left sitting on the grass outside. Several ambulances drove back and forth, and security vehicles surrounded the scene.\n\nAs if to underscore Turkey's determination to carry on in the face of a growing threat, the airport reopened Wednesday, just hours after the dead were carried away and glass and debris were cleared.\n\nAdam Keally, from Boston, said he heard gunfire followed by several explosions, then saw people \"very badly injured.\"\n\nHevin Zini, 12, had just arrived from Duesseldorf, Germany, with her family and was in tears.\n\n\"There was blood on the ground,\" she told the AP. \"Everything was blown up to bits... if we had arrived two minutes earlier, it could have been us.\"\n\nTwo South African tourists, Paul and Susie Roos from Cape Town, were at the airport and due to fly home at the time of the explosions.\n\n\"We came up from the arrivals to the departures, up the escalator when we heard these shots going off,\" Paul Roos told the AP. \"There was this guy going roaming around, he was dressed in black and he had a handgun.\"\n\nVeysel Allay, who was waiting for a friend in the arrivals terminal, told the Daily Telegraph, \"A man ran up and ripped open his jacket, showing a bomb vest. I ran before he did anything.\"\n\nJim Hyong Lee of South Korea told the Telegraph he and his family were checking in for a flight home when \"we heard gunshots.\"\n\n\"I grabbed my family and ran,\" Lee said. \"Someone waved us into the prayer room and hid us there until the police came.\"\n\nA State Department spokesman told Fox News late Tuesday that Americans in Turkey were being urged to contact family members immediately.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Embassy in Turkey said at least seven Saudis were injured in the attack and all were in stable condition.\n\nU.S. and world leaders immediately offered condolences following the attack.\n\nIn the U.S., President Obama was briefed about the attack by Lisa Monaco, his homeland security and counterterrorism adviser. A statement from the White House on Tuesday condemned the attack \"in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\n\"We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, our NATO Ally and partner, along with all of our friends and allies around the world, as we continue to confront the threat of terrorism,\" the statement said.\n\nTurkey has stepped up controls at airports and land borders and deported thousands of foreign fighters, but has struggled to tackle the threat of ISIS militants while also conducting vast security operations against Kurdish rebels, who have also been blamed for recent deadly attacks.\n\nTurkish airports have security checks at both the entrance of terminal buildings and then later before entry to departure gates.\n\nIstanbul's Ataturk Airport was the 11th busiest airport in the world last year, with 61.8 million passengers, according to Airports Council International.

Christopher Stevens, who died in the attacks along with three other Americans, told then-Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory Hicks in July 2012 that Clinton wanted to visit Libya again, perhaps in October, according to Hicks\u2019s testimony to the committee. Stevens told Hicks that he wanted to have a \u201cdeliverable\u201d to announce if and when Clinton came to Libya, namely that the temporary U.S. mission to Benghazi would be made into a permanent U.S. diplomatic facility.\n\nThe detail, which Hicks also told another House investigation in 2013, is one of the key issues Republicans are focusing on in the several-hundred-page report the Benghazi committee is releasing Tuesday. After spending the better part of two years and more than $7 million, the panel headed by Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) is under pressure to show that its investment of time and taxpayer money was not wasted. Following several other investigations into the attacks, there\u2019s not much left to know, but Republicans plan to highlight whatever new nuggets of information they can.\n\nFor Clinton, all news about the Benghazi attacks is bad news. The report details Clinton\u2019s actions on the afternoon and night of the attacks, and Republicans plan to argue that she, along with other top Obama administration officials, failed to mount a robust and coordinated response while terrorists stormed the Benghazi mission and a nearby CIA annex. Though these are allegations that Clinton has fended off several times before, their resurgence with some new information will uncomfortably bring her worst night as secretary of state back to the fore of the presidential campaign.\n\nHere are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified in October 2015. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans see the revelation that Clinton was planning a trip to Libya and that Stevens wanted to make the Benghazi mission permanent as evidence that she was trying to cement her legacy as a major proponent of the intervention to topple Moammar Gaddafi, but ignored several signs that the facility was unsafe.\n\n\u201cIt remains unclear why a State Department presence in Benghazi was so important,\u201d two Republican committee members, Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mike Pompeo (Kan.), wrote in their own summary of the lengthy report. \u201cNo matter how important a presence was \u2014 to Secretary Clinton, to the State Department, to the United States \u2014 it should have become very clear that the risks of staying without more security outweighed any possible benefit.\u201d\n\nClinton has said many times that she did not personally deny any requests for more security in Benghazi; those decisions were made by lower-level State Department personnel. Republicans on the Benghazi committee argue that given Clinton\u2019s keen interest in Benghazi and her plans to visit Libya, she should have taken action to respond to the dangerous conditions there.\n\nJordan and Pompeo point to an Aug. 17, 2012, memo from Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Beth Jones, sent to Clinton, which warned of deteriorating security conditions and overall \u201clawlessness\u201d in eastern Libya, including a spike in bombings, abductions, assassinations and carjackings.\n\nWhen Clinton was asked about the Jones memo by the committee, she said: \u201cThere was no recommendation based on any of the assessments, not from our State Department experts, not from the Intelligence Community, that we should abandon either Benghazi or Tripoli.\u201d\n\nThat perceived lack of response to the growing dangers in Benghazi, set against Clinton\u2019s desire to travel to Libya and make Benghazi a permanent facility, makes Clinton culpable in the tragedy that followed, according to Jordan and Pompeo.\n\n\u201cShe had the last, clear chance to order an immediate closure of the Benghazi facility yet she did nothing, and four Americans died,\u201d they wrote.\n\n1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren join forces at rally View Photos The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and the Massachusetts senator electrified a crowd by locking arms and excoriating Donald Trump, the GOP presumptive nominee.

But the panel does report that although the first attack began at 3:42 p.m. Eastern, Clinton did not speak to President Obama until over six hours later.\n\nClinton did not talk directly with Panetta even once on the night of the attacks, according to Jordan and Pompeo\u2019s summary of the committee report. Panetta met with Obama at about 5:30 p.m. for half an hour and had no further contact with the president. Clinton spoke with Petraeus at 5:38 p.m., but only once.\n\nJordan and Pompeo wrote that senior officials should have been in the same room dealing with the ongoing crisis, as they were during the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in 2011. \u201cBenghazi should have merited the same level of urgency,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe Democratic members of the Benghazi committee dealt with the allegation that Clinton wasn\u2019t active and engaged on the night of the attack in their own 300-plus-page report, released Monday. They laid out a timeline of Clinton\u2019s other activities that night, beyond just her calls with other top officials.\n\nClinton was engaged in near-constant calls and other interactions with a host of U.S. and foreign officials, including several calls with national security adviser Susan Rice, the Libyan president, and officials on the ground, including Hicks. She was the only Cabinet official to participate in a secure video conference call in which representatives from various agencies discussed the response in the early evening.\n\n\u201cSenior officials have uniformly testified that they were doing everything possible to provide emergency assistance to those under the attack,\u201d Democratic committee member Adam Schiff (Calif.) told me. \u201cThe most Republicans can do is try to critique the secretary\u2019s actions on that day because they have nothing else left to go after.\u201d\n\nSchiff also rejected another supposed revelation that Republicans on the committee will focus on this week. The Republican report purports to reveal that no military assets were sent toward Libya until the attacks had ended. Although Panetta ordered the deployment of a Marine Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, or FAST, those assets were sent to Tripoli and no military assets were sent to Benghazi, the report alleges.\n\n\u201cNothing in the Republican spin changes the underlying facts,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cNothing has disturbed the conclusions of the bipartisan House Armed Services Committee investigation that no military assets could have gotten there in time.\u201d\n\nThe Republican committee report will also seek to reaffirm long-standing accusations that Clinton lied about there being protests in Benghazi.\n\nThough the Benghazi committee did find some new details, it failed to unearth anything so damning as to change many minds about the events of that tragic night, or who is to blame for them.", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/22/Others/Images/2015-10-22/___hrc_71445539031.jpg", "title": "House Benghazi report: Clinton was planning a trip to Libya before the attacks", "summary": "For Clinton, all news about the Benghazi attacks is bad news.\nHere are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified in October 2015.\nThe Republican report purports to reveal that no military assets were sent toward Libya until the attacks had ended.\nClinton did not talk directly with Panetta even once on the night of the attacks, according to Jordan and Pompeo\u2019s summary of the committee report.\nThe detail, which Hicks also told another House investigation in 2013, is one of the key issues Republicans are focusing on in the several-hundred-page report the Benghazi committee is releasing Tuesday.", "source": "Washington Post", "bias": "Bias: Lean Left", "authors": ["Josh Rogin Is A Columnist For The Global Opinions Section Of The Washington Post He Writes About Foreign Policy National Security"], "keywords": ["benghazi", "clinton", "libya", "attacks", "house", "republicans", "state", "planning", "committee", "night", "report", "trip", "secretary"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-06-26 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/26/brexit-leaders-are-walking-back-some-of-their-biggest-promises/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_wv-brexit-leaders-5pm%3Ahomepage/story", "text": "Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party. (Stefan Wermuth/Reuters)\n\nIn the days after Britain's momentous decision to withdraw from the European Union, there has been much talk of voter's remorse. Some who voted in favor of a British exit have said they merely wanted to lodge a protest vote and hadn't expected the \"leave\" camp to actually win. Others said they had no idea that the implications of such a vote would be so dire.\n\nBut one of the biggest reasons for regret may end up being that promises made to \"leave\" voters by leading Brexit proponents are being walked back by those very leaders. On talk shows over the weekend, three of them in particular were confronted by flabbergasted hosts over their playing down of integral elements of the Brexit campaign.\n\n[Britain\u2019s two main political parties in turmoil over E.U. fallout]\n\nIn a stunning victory for the \"Leave\" campaign, Britain has voted to exit the European Union. Here's what happens next. (Jason Aldag,Adam Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nNigel Farage was perhaps the loudest voice calling for Britain's exit from the European Union, though he wasn't officially part of the \"Leave\" campaign. As leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, he represented the isolationist, anti-immigration core of the Brexit movement. Speaking to the host of ITV's \"Good Morning Britain,\" Farage called one of the \"leave\" campaign's biggest promises a \"mistake,\" though he distanced himself from the decision to make the promise in the first place.\n\nHost: \"The 350 million pounds a week that we send to the E.U., which we will no longer send to the E.U., can you guarantee that's going to go to the NHS [Britain's National Health Service]?\"\n\nFarage: \"No, I can't, and I would never have made that claim. It is one of the mistakes that, I think, the 'leave' campaign made.\"\n\nHost: \"Hold on a moment. That was one of your adverts.\"\n\nThey then sparred over whether it was the \"leave\" campaign's advertisement or Farage's in particular, before moving on. The advertisement was the campaign's, not Farage's.\n\nHost: \"That's why many people voted.\"\n\nFarage: \"They made a mistake doing that.\"\n\nHost: \"You're saying after 17 million people have voted for 'leave,' based \u2014 I don't know how many people voted on the basis of that advert, but that was a huge part of the propaganda \u2014you're now saying that's a mistake?\"\n\nOn \"The Andrew Marr Show,\" another leading \"leave\" campaigner, Iain Duncan Smith, said that the \u00a3350-million figure was \"an extrapolation\" and that the campaign had never said that all of that money would go to the NHS, just a good portion of it. Many were quick to point out that the \"leave\" campaign had a bus emblazoned with the monetary figure and at least strongly implied that the money would be reallocated to the NHS. Smith is pictured below alongside the bus.\n\nIDS denies he was ever associated with \u00a3350 million for NHS. Photo: Rob.

Immigration flows to Britain have been increasing, and levels of resentment are high among certain segments of the British public.\n\nThat explains the exasperation of a BBC Radio 5 host who was talking to \"leave\" campaigner Nigel Evans.\n\nHost: \"Was it not inferred that if you vote 'leave,' immigration would go down?\"\n\nEvans: \"Well, we said we would control it, and that is the most important point.\"\n\nHost: \"Control it by bringing it down, Nigel?\"\n\nEvans: \"No, but there are two differences here, and this is where there is some misunderstanding.\"\n\nEvans goes on to offer some background on how the \"leave\" campaign's immigration promises were made, but the host cuts him off.\n\nHost: \"Straight question, straight answer, Nigel. Will immigration fall significantly when the U.K. leaves the E.U.?\"\n\nSuffice it to say that Evans does not have a straight answer.\n\n1 of 56 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Britons react to cutting ties with the European Union View Photos In late June, many celebrated the referendum results, and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he will resign after Britons went to the polls.

Two-thirds of Americans see him as biased against groups such as women, minorities or Muslims, and a new high, 64 percent, call Trump unqualified to serve as president.\n\nThese and other doubts about Trump have produced a sharp 14-point swing in preferences among registered voters, from +2 points for Trump in mid-May, after he clinched the GOP nomination, to +12 points for Clinton now, 51-39 percent. That snaps the race essentially back to where it was in March.\n\nSee PDF for full results.\n\nAdding third-party candidates Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green) to the mix makes no substantive difference: a 10-point Clinton advantage, 47-37-7-3 percent among registered voters. Looking at those who say they\u2019re certain to vote in November likewise produces a very similar result: +11 Clinton in the two-way matchup, +9 in the four-way.\n\nThe national poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds another apparent impact of Trump\u2019s problems: Perhaps benefitting from comparison, Barack Obama\u2019s job approval rating has gained 5 points, to 56 percent, matching its high since the early days of his presidency. That includes 55 percent approval specifically on handling the economy.\n\nUnderlying Views\n\nTrial heats are hypothetical; they ask which candidate people would support if the election were today \u2013 which it isn\u2019t. At least as important are the underlying sentiments informing current preferences, and they show the extent of Trump\u2019s troubles given his recent controversial comments. Among them:\n\n\u2022 The public by 66-29 percent think he\u2019s unfairly biased against groups such as women, minorities or Muslims.\n\n\u2022 Americans by 68-28 percent think his comment about Judge Gonzalo Curiel was racist. Regardless of whether or not it was racist, 85 percent say it was inappropriate.\n\n\u2022 While most Americans disapprove of Clinton\u2019s handling of her email while secretary of state (34-56 percent, approve-disapprove), they\u2019re equally disenchanted with Trump\u2019s handling of questions about Trump University (19-59 percent, with more undecided).\n\n\u2022 Most generally, the public by 56-36 percent, a 20-point margin, says Trump is standing against their beliefs as opposed to standing up for their beliefs.\n\nClinton, further, receives substantially better marks than Trump\u2019s for her response to the lone-wolf terrorist attack June 12 in Orlando, Florida: Americans by an 18-point margin, 46-28 percent, say Clinton did a better job than Trump overall in responding to the attack.\n\nAnother result marks a rebuke to Trump in his own party. On June 15, referring to Republican leaders, he said, \u201cJust please be quiet. Don\u2019t talk.\u201d In this survey, however, Republicans and GOP-leaning independents by a wide 62-35 percent say party leaders should speak out when they disagree with Trump, rather than avoid criticizing their likely nominee.\n\nIndeed, Trump is supported by just 77 percent of Republican registered voters in the two-way test in this survey, compared with 85 percent in this group last month and, again, essentially back to his in-party support in March. In the four-way trial he\u2019s at 74 percent among Republicans.\n\nResults of this poll temper the notion that last week\u2019s Brexit vote in the United Kingdom marks a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo that advantages Trump on this side of the Atlantic. On one hand, nativist sentiment, populism and economic anxiety clearly benefitted Trump in the race for the Republican nomination. On the other, his general election campaign requires broader support \u2013 and he\u2019s had a dreadful few weeks.\n\nQualifications, Temperament and Anxiety\n\nDoubts about Trump are reflected in yet-sharper questions about his qualifications for office \u2013 perhaps the most basic hurdle for a candidate to clear \u2013 and continued widespread anxiety about a potential Trump presidency.\n\nSixty-four percent of Americans now see Trump as unqualified to serve as president, up 6 points from an already-high 58 percent last month. Thirty-four percent see him as qualified.\n\nClinton\u2019s numbers are essentially the opposite, and unchanged: Sixty-one percent see her as qualified for the office, 37 percent as not qualified. Moreover, while 33 percent feel strongly that Clinton is not qualified, many more \u2013 56 percent \u2013 feel strongly that Trump doesn\u2019t pass this test.\n\nClinton also continues to surpass Trump easily in views of which candidate has the better personality and temperament to serve effectively. Clinton\u2019s vast 61-28 percent lead on this question is essentially unchanged from last month\u2019s 61-31 percent.\n\nFor all this, Clinton is hardly beloved. Fifty percent of Americans say they\u2019re anxious about the idea of her as president (vs. 47 percent who are comfortable with it). When it comes to a Trump presidency, however, anxiety rises to 70 percent, with just 27 percent comfortable with the idea. These are about the same as when last asked in January, and the 70 percent anxiety number matches Trump\u2019s unfavorability rating in an ABC/Post poll last week.\n\nSomeone Else?\n\nDissatisfaction with Trump and Clinton alike raises the question of a third way \u2013 but partisanship is a strong anchor, and this poll indicates little traction to date for an alternative party. Just 18 percent of registered voters say there\u2019s a third-party candidate they\u2019re seriously considering \u2013 and when asked to name that candidate, a mere 2 percent offer Johnson\u2019s name, and 1 percent mention Stein, a very low level of unaided recall.\n\nWhen presented directly with Johnson and Stein as alternatives, they receive 7 and 3 percent support, respectively, as noted \u2013 drawing similarly from both major-party candidates. Johnson\u2019s selected by 6 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters and 5 percent of Clinton\u2019s in a two-way matchup; Stein, by 4 percent of Clinton\u2019s and 1 percent of Trump\u2019s.\n\nObama\n\nThe president\u2019s resurgent approval rating is particularly welcome for Clinton, given his reported eagerness to campaign for her.\n\nHis advance is broadly based, and political divisions remain high \u2013 88 percent approval for Obama among Democrats, 50 percent among independents and just 18 percent among Republicans. Tellingly, 85 percent of Obama approvers support Clinton, vs. just 8 percent of Obama disapprovers.\n\nObama\u2019s approval rating is similar to both Bill Clinton\u2019s 57 percent and Ronald Reagan\u2019s 56 percent at about this point in their presidencies, and far better than George W. Bush\u2019s 29 percent.\n\nThat said, discontent with the status quo does remain, and poses some risk for Clinton as the incumbent party\u2019s nominee. Registered voters by 56-39 percent say they\u2019d rather see the next president set the nation in a new direction from Obama\u2019s rather than continuing his course. \u201cNew direction\u201d voters favor Trump over Clinton by a wide margin, 64-26 percent \u2013 but those who want to stay Obama\u2019s course back Clinton even more widely, 87-6 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s notable, too, that the number of Americans who prefer a new direction is about the same now as it was at this stage of Reagan\u2019s presidency \u2013 when the nation went on, nonetheless, to elect Reagan\u2019s vice president George H.W. Bush, to the top job.\n\nGroups\n\nPartisanship can follow political preferences, and in this poll Democrats account for 36 percent of all adults and 37 percent of registered voters \u2013 a non-significant (+3) difference from last month. (The former is numerically its highest since 2009, the latter, since 2012.) Republicans account for 24 percent of all adults and 27 percent of registered voters, about their average in recent years, with the rest independents.\n\nThis accounts for little of the shift in voter preferences, however. Even using the same party divisions from last month\u2019s ABC/Post survey, in which Trump was +2, he\u2019d now be -8. The reason, mentioned above, is his comparatively weak performance among Republicans \u2013 77 percent support \u2013 compared with Clinton\u2019s support among Democrats, 90 percent.\n\nObama\u2019s gain in approval, similarly, is not fundamentally based on any change in partisanship \u2013 last month\u2019s partisan divisions would put him at 54-42 percent now, vs. his actual 56-41 percent in this poll.\n\nThere are notable shifts among groups in the latest vote preference results. Largest is a 16-point loss for Trump, and 17-point advance for Clinton, among white Catholics, a potentially key group that accounts for one in seven registered voters.\n\nClinton, further, is now leading among young adults, a group in which Trump was surprisingly competitive last month. Trump is -11, and Clinton +11, among registered voters who don\u2019t have a college degree, as well as among liberals and conservatives alike. And Trump is -10, Clinton +11, among white men.\n\nClinton continues to prevail mightily among nonwhites \u2013 by 77-15 percent now, vs. 69-21 percent last month; that includes 90-8 percent among blacks and 69-20 percent among Hispanics. (For an adequate sample size, this combines results among blacks, and separately among Hispanics, from May and June.) Trump leads Clinton by 50-40 percent among whites, down from 57-33 percent last month.\n\nIn another division of potential interest, Clinton leads Trump by 57-33 percent in the states that Obama won in 2012 (+24 points), while Trump leads more narrowly, by 51-41 percent (+10), in the states Mitt Romney won four years ago.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone June 20-23, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including 836 registered voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect, for the full sample, and 4 points for registered voters. Partisan divisions are 36-24-33 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents, in the full sample, 37-27-30 among registered voters.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y.

Now they\u2019ll find out whether it will.\n\nU.K. financial leaders are scrambling to reassure households, businesses and investors that they can contain the doom and gloom they had predicted in case of a British exit, or Brexit. The pound plunged to its lowest level in over 30 years on Friday, raising concerns about price inflation, and shares in the U.K.\u2019s biggest banks and real estate builders posted double-digit declines as economists predicted the country would fall into recession.\n\nEconomists slashed their forecasts for Britain, with some expecting a recession and next to no growth next year. That\u2019s a sharp reverse for an economy that had been among the best-performing in the developed world in recent years.\n\nIn an early sign of problems, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the U.K. outlook from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative.\u201d The referendum result, it said, \u201cwill herald a prolonged period of uncertainty for the UK, with negative implications for the country\u2019s medium-term growth outlook.\u201d\n\nOnly the soothing reassurances of Bank of England Governor Mark Carney managed to ease the market carnage on Friday, as he pledged to stabilize markets if needed. But beyond the short-term market turmoil, the concern is what the vote means for the national economy and its 64 million people.\n\nBefore the vote, with campaigning in full swing, the British Treasury had estimated that an exit from the EU would cost the country the equivalent of 4,300 pounds ($5,900) per household. Tax receipts would face a 30 billion pounds shortfall that would have to be filled with tax increases on income and inheritance. House prices, the Treasury had said, could be as much as 18 percent lower by 2018 than if the country hadn\u2019t left the EU.\n\nCampaigners for \u201cleave\u201d dismissed this as scare-mongering. With the vote result confirmed, the \u201cremain\u201d camp sought to shift away from warnings and into damage control: trying to maintain confidence in the business community and among households.\n\nThe City of London Corporation, which represents the financial services industry, a big maker of money and jobs for the country, sought to downplay the impact of the vote on the City, the square mile that is the heart of London\u2019s financial hub.\n\n\u201cThe City of London has thrived as a financial and trading center for more than a thousand years and will continue to do so,\u201d Mark Boleat, policy chairman for the Corporation, said in a statement. \u201cThere will be no mass exit of banks and financial institutions from the square mile. While there will be uncertainty as Brexit negotiations go on we are still the financial center of the fifth-largest economy in the world.\u201d\n\nSome companies, particularly banks, had said they could move jobs away from London if Britain leaves the EU. That is likely to cost some jobs. How many is yet to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe real question now is how badly the EU will punish the U.K. for this decision,\u201d said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management.\n\nOthers were looking on the bright side.\n\nAt First Property Group, a London-based real estate investment firm, Chief Executive Ben Habib, who backed leaving the EU, said the vote means Britain will now be able to drive a better deal with the rest of Europe.\n\nSupporters of the \u201cleave\u201d campaign had accepted that there was a potential economic cost to leaving the EU, but have claimed it is a short-term price to pay in exchange for greater control of policies like immigration and borders.\n\n\u201cWe now have the foundations for a very good negotiation with the EU,\u201d he said, while minimizing the market turmoil. \u201cThe markets are gyrating, but these are gyrations and will not materially affect our economy.\u201d\n\nHabib said the drop in the pound would help British exporters by making their goods cheaper and more competitive in the global marketplace.\n\nHabib\u2019s colleague and friend George Digby, however, was less upbeat. He had voted to remain and said the best he could do was wait and see if there is significant economic damage, as his \u201cremain\u201d camp had claimed.\n\n\u201cI hope I am proved wrong on that score,\u201d he said.", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/brexit-economy.jpg", "title": "As Financial Leaders Heed Economic Repercussions of Brexit, Supporters Deem It a Short-Term Price for Greater Policy Control \u2013 TheBlaze", "summary": "U.K. financial leaders are scrambling to reassure households, businesses and investors that they can contain the doom and gloom they had predicted in case of a British exit, or Brexit.\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The British were warned for weeks that a vote to leave the European Union would result in economic pain.\nWith the vote result confirmed, the \u201cremain\u201d camp sought to shift away from warnings and into damage control: trying to maintain confidence in the business community and among households.\nBut beyond the short-term market turmoil, the concern is what the vote means for the national economy and its 64 million people.\nThat\u2019s a sharp reverse for an economy that had been among the best-performing in the developed world in recent years.", "source": "TheBlaze", "bias": "Bias: Right", "authors": ["Carly Hoilman"], "keywords": ["real", "shortterm", "result", "eu", "financial", "leaders", "country", "price", "greater", "theblaze", "vote", "remain", "london", "british", "heed", "policy", "repercussions", "uk", "supporters"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-06-23 00:00:00", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/23/brexit-referendum-turnout-heavy-vote-close/", "text": "The voters of the United Kingdom spoke Thursday and, to the surprise of pundits and their elected officials, declared that they want out of the European Union.\n\nIn a historic nail-biter of a referendum, the nation voted to exit the 28-member EU bloc, a result widely seen to have been driven public fear of immigration that has surged in the nation during recent years but which quickly prompted a run on the British currency.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned against leaving the EU, announced Friday morning that he will resign in October, saying that \u201cfresh leadership\u201d is now needed in the U.K.\n\nWhile turnout was at a near record levels, and officials had predicted a tally that was \u201ctoo close to call,\u201d the major TV networks BBC and ITV called a victory for the \u201cLeave\u201d forces in the so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d vote late Thursday night.\n\nWith more than 100 percent of the vote counted, the \u201cLeave\u201d forces had an edge of 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent.\n\nThe \u201cremain\u201d forces had carried a slight lead in several areas of the country during early counting on Thursday night.

Both Wall Street futures and the British pound had risen strongly Thursday in the belief that the remain forces would win.\n\nThe British currency Friday had lost about 12 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar Friday, with the pound worth $1.34, a 30-year low and a 11 percent loss just since Thursday. The Euro was also off against other world currencies, as investors began to doubt the viability of the whole European Union.\n\nThe major stock-markets in East Asia all lost significant value, and trading on Japan\u2019s Nikkei Index was reined in automatically under its \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rule, when the market had lost 8 percent of its value.\n\nBut on Thursday, the atmosphere was lively across the country. Long lines were reported at many polling stations as many braved torrential downpours and threats of flooding in some areas. Early indications were that turnout topped 70 percent \u2014 the highest since the 1997 general election.\n\nCampaign organizers and politicians carried their respective arguments down to the last minute. Prime Minister David Cameron crisscrossed the nation to plead for a vote to stay in the European Union and to \u201cput jobs first, put the economy first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that our economy will be weaker if we leave and stronger if we stay,\u201d he told one crowd in Birmingham.\n\nNot all Britons agreed. \u201cWe have a strong export capability in Yorkshire from high-tech goods to services,\u201d said Roger Tattersall, assistant director for Vote Leave in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to export anywhere in the world without the tariffs that are caused by our membership in the European Union,\u201d Mr. Tattersall said.\n\nAside from the economic and financial effects of a British exit, U.S. analysts said, a vote to leave would have massive consequences for the European Union and could inspire other eurosceptic groups to follow suit.\n\n\u201cBrexit would inevitably set in motion centrifugal dynamics on the continent, empowering nationalists in countries that have no chance of being successful outside of the EU,\u201d said Dalibor Rohac, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cFrom the economic woes of the eurozone, through the political tensions brought about by the refugee crisis, to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s use of propaganda and energy ties to undermine liberal democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, the continent is at a greater risk of descending into chaos than at any point in its postwar history,\u201d Mr. Rohac wrote in a recent commentary.\n\nBrexit proponents said a departure from the European Union would save Britain economically and culturally while freeing the country from the dictates of Brussels on issues such as immigration policy and food standards.\n\n\u201cOur campaign has been about optimism and self-reliance,\u201d said former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who broke with fellow Conservative Mr. Cameron to become a leading voice for the Leave forces.\n\nDespite the differing viewpoints, voters on both sides expressed frustration at how the respective campaigns were handled. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a load of lies on both sides,\u201d said Faith Pearson, 48, an unemployed Brexit supporter from Brompton.\n\n\u201cBut I liked Leave because they haven\u2019t told us what the economy is going to be like because they don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cRemain is telling us, but they can\u2019t make predictions.\u201d\n\nKieran Clark, a 25-year-old from Yorkshire who voted Remain, wished he had heard more facts. \u201cI\u2019m not too happy with it,\u201d he said, noting a \u201clot of scaremongering and exaggerated figures.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a lot of it has been about pure facts and figures,\u201d he said.\n\nEven Britons abroad were irritated with the campaign. \u201cI think it\u2019s made British politics look completely shambolic,\u201d said Fiona Seymour, a 48-year-old Londoner who lives in Berlin. \u201cI think the campaign has been beset with too many in-party rivalries with very little real information being given out, which makes a mockery of the English democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Benjamin Plackett and Patrick Costello contributed to this report from London.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Katherine Clark (D) of Massachusetts shows Democratic members staging a sit-in 'to demand action on common sense gun legislation' in Washington Wednesday.\n\nThe Democrats borrowed a page from the civil rights era Wednesday, staging a sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives in a demand for a vote on gun control.\n\n\"We're calling on the leadership of the House to bring common sense gun control legislation to the House floor,\" said Rep.

The sight of lawmakers in suits sitting on the blue-carpeted floor of the House \u2013 depending on one's political perspective \u2013 either represented an outpouring of frustration by lawmakers who say they are unable to sit idly by after yet another mass shooting or the theatrical grandstanding increasingly emblematic of a polarized system.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about bipartisanship? Take our quiz.\n\nOne party's bold leadership was the other party's stonewalling tantrum.\n\nThe fact that elected lawmakers are, in their own House, resorting to tactics ordinarily employed by the oppressed is perhaps not surprising in the toxic stew of the 2016 election season. But political observers were wary of both the tactic and what it might portend.\n\n\"Sit-ins are righteous when they're the tool of an oppressed minority group insisting on equal rights,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf on The Atlantic's live blog. \"But members of Congress are among the most powerful political actors in the country, and they are acting on an issue that is endlessly discussed and debated, not one that requires unusual tactics, like subverting order in the national legislature, to air all sides of the matter. When Republicans respond to not getting their way by undermining legislative norms, the press objects. It should object here.\"\n\nBut others, including two presidents, extolled the event as necessary in an age when the normal wheels of governance appear permanently stalled on the issue of gun violence.\n\n\"Thank you John Lewis for leading on gun violence when we need it most,\" President Obama tweeted.\n\n\"This is leadership,\" former President Bill Clinton wrote.\n\nThe protest comes as federal lawmakers have struggled to craft a legislative response after the murder of 49 people in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., on June 11\u2014 the worst terrorist act in the US since 9/11. Sen. Chris Murphy (D) of Connecticut led a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor last week calling for the chamber to vote on gun control legislation. The Senate voted on four bills on Monday. None passed.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine is working on another gun control proposal, but nothing has yet been proposed in the House.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has not yet committed to a vote, according to spokeswoman AshLee Strong.\n\n\"The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair,\" Ms. Strong said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe sit-in has been broadcast mostly on social media as C-SPAN's cameras, controlled by the Republican majority, have been switched off most of the afternoon, with many Democrats using the hashtag #NoBillNoBreak.

Lewis organized sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in the 1960s, and joined Martin Luther King Jr. in civil rights marches in Selma, Ala., and the 1963 March on Washington. Lewis told NBC News that \"sometimes you are moved by history.\"\n\nSome Republicans, for their part, referenced history in their criticism of Wednesday's sit-in.\n\n\"Calling this a sit-in is a disgrace to Woolworth's.

The court is scheduled to issue its final three decisions of the term, including one on a restrictive Texas abortion law, on Monday.\n\nMr. Obama said the court\u2019s immigration ruling was a stark reminder of the consequences of Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider Judge Merrick B. Garland, the president\u2019s nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cIf you keep on blocking judges from getting on the bench, then courts can\u2019t issue decisions,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd what that means is then you are going to have the status quo frozen, and we are not able to make progress on some very important issues.\u201d\n\nThe case, United States v. Texas, No. 15-674, concerned a 2014 executive action by the president to allow as many as five million unauthorized immigrants who were the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program that would spare them from deportation and provide them with work permits. The program was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.\n\nMr. Obama has said he took the action after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, promptly challenged the plan, accusing the president of ignoring administrative procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by circumventing Congress.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision keeps in place what we have maintained from the very start: One person, even a president, cannot unilaterally change the law,\u201d Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said in a statement after the ruling. \u201cThis is a major setback to President Obama\u2019s attempts to expand executive power, and a victory for those who believe in the separation of powers and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe court did not disclose how the justices had voted, but they were almost certainly split along ideological lines. Administration officials had hoped that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would join the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing to save the program.\n\nThe case hinged in part on whether Texas had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. Texas said it had standing because it would be costly for the state to give driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChief Justice Roberts is often skeptical of expansive standing arguments. But it seemed plain when the case was argued in April that he was satisfied that Texas had standing, paving the way for a deadlock.\n\nMr. Obama said the White House did not believe the terse ruling from the court had any effect on the president\u2019s authority to act unilaterally. But he said the practical effect would be to freeze his efforts on behalf of immigrants until after the November election.\n\nBreaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.\n\nHe also predicted that lawmakers would eventually act to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system.\n\n\u201cCongress is not going to be able to ignore America forever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if; it\u2019s a matter of when. We get these spasms of politics around immigration and fear-mongering, and then our traditions and our history and our better impulses kick in.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials had repeatedly argued that presidents in both parties had used similar executive authority in applying the nation\u2019s immigration laws. And they said Congress had granted federal law enforcement wide discretion over how those laws should be carried out.\n\nBut the court\u2019s ruling may mean that the next president will again need to seek a congressional compromise to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws. And it left immigration activists deeply disappointed.\n\n\u201cThis is personal,\u201d Rocio Saenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement. \u201cWe will remain at the front lines, committed to defending the immigration initiatives and paving the path to lasting immigration reform.\u201d\n\nThe lower court rulings in the case were provisional, and the litigation will now continue and may again reach the Supreme Court when it is back at full strength. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that the program will be revived.\n\nIn February 2015, Judge Andrew S. Hanen of Federal District Court in Brownsville, Tex., entered a preliminary injunction shutting down the program while the legal case proceeded. The government appealed, and a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans affirmed the injunction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn their Supreme Court briefs, the states acknowledged that the president had wide authority over immigration matters, telling the justices that \u201cthe executive does have enforcement discretion to forbear from removing aliens on an individual basis.\u201d Their quarrel, they said, was with what they called a blanket grant of \u201clawful presence\u201d to millions of immigrants, entitling them to various benefits.\n\nIn response, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. told the justices that this \u201clawful presence\u201d was merely what had always followed from the executive branch\u2019s decision not to deport someone for a given period of time.\n\n\u201cDeferred action does not provide these individuals with any lawful status under the immigration laws,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it provides some measure of dignity and decent treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt recognizes the damage that would be wreaked by tearing apart families,\u201d Mr. Verrilli added, \u201cand it allows individuals to leave the shadow economy and work on the books to provide for their families, thereby reducing exploitation and distortion in our labor markets.\u201d\n\nThe states said they had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave them standing to sue.\n\nJudge Jerry E. Smith, writing for the majority in the appeals court, focused on an injury said to have been suffered by Texas, which he said would have to spend millions of dollars to provide driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants as a consequence of the federal program.\n\nMr. Verrilli told the justices that Texas\u2019 injury was self-inflicted, a product of its decision to offer driver\u2019s licenses for less than they cost to produce and to tie eligibility for them to federal standards.\n\nTexas responded that being required to change its laws was itself the sort of harm that conferred standing. \u201cSuch a forced change in Texas law would impair Texas\u2019 sovereign interest in \u2018the power to create and enforce a legal code,\u2019\u201d the state\u2019s lawyers wrote in a brief.\n\nJudge Hanen grounded his injunction on the Obama administration\u2019s failure to give notice and seek public comments on its new program. He found that notice and comment were required because the program gave blanket relief to entire categories of people, notwithstanding the administration\u2019s assertion that it required case-by-case determinations about who was eligible for the program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one.

John Larson skipped the rare session with his party\u2019s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian. Larson had an obscure question about House rules: What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest, effectively shutting down the House?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLarson was told that it was an \u201cunprecedented instance that was hard to know what the response would be.\u201d It was assumed the raucous Democratic protest would force Republicans to adjourn the House, which is exactly what happened.\n\nAs Democrats on Capitol Hill struggle to push new gun control measures in the face of overwhelming GOP opposition, Larson and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) \u2014 with the blessing of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats \u2014 wanted to do something dramatic after the massacre in Orlando.\n\nAnd Wednesday\u2019s protest was nothing if not dramatic \u2014 an escalation of tactics by a virtually powerless minority that amounted to guerrilla warfare to force action on an issue. Longtime House watchers hadn\u2019t seen anything quite like it in many years, if at all.\n\nIf Republicans stuck together, Democrats would never be able to move their favored proposals, including blocking gun purchases by anyone on the federal \u201cno fly\u201d list, and expanded background checks for gun sales.\n\nSo Larson and Lewis and a handful of their colleagues decided to copy a GOP tactic from when Republicans were in the minority in 2008: Get dozens of members to go on the floor and refuse to leave. Demand action or say they won\u2019t let the House adjourn in mid-July. Block the House from any business until Republicans give in.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan and Republican leaders could either yield and allow a vote \u2014 extremely unlikely \u2014 or House Democrats would bring new attention to the issue. It was the GOP tactic on steroids, this time in the era of widespread social media. And the passion of Democrats on guns far exceeded that of Republicans eight years ago, when the GOP was demanding more offshore oil drilling.\n\nThe plan was laid out at a Tuesday night meeting with Larson and about a dozen Democrats. They met in the office of Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts to hash out a plan to force a vote on the matter. The lawmakers decided they were ready to play hardball \u2014 even if it meant shutting down their half of Congress for an entire day, or longer.\n\n\u201cMost of the members didn\u2019t even know what was going ahead for us,\u201d Lewis told C-SPAN. \u201cWe never said anything or shared anything.\u201d\n\nWhen Lewis and Larson led their band of roughly two dozen Democrats onto the floor Wednesday to begin their sit-in, they staged the equivalent of the Senate\u2019s filibuster. What began as an intricate behind-the-scenes plot with a handful of members grew to include almost the entire 188-person Democratic Caucus.\n\nReleasing their pent-up anger over the nation\u2019s gun laws after the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead and 53 wounded, they took over the House floor for hours, plopping down and shutting down all legislative business until GOP leadership would allow a vote.\n\n\u201cWe said at the beginning of this week that we would use every tool in our toolbox,\u201d Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cWe said some of those tools involved hammers. Some of those tools involved screwdrivers. Some are blunt, some not. We\u2019re going to keep using every single tool.\u201d\n\nHill Democrats had been itching for a political fight on guns since the Orlando shootings. In the Senate, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) last week had staged a successful filibuster that caught national attention and eventually led to a series of floor votes. Those measures failed, but there will be another vote on a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n\nHouse Democrats wanted to do something similar and had been brainstorming for days. There had been talk about trying a discharge petition \u2014 doing an end run on GOP leaders to force a vote \u2014 but they didn\u2019t have the support and it would take too long.\n\nSo they needed to come up with something bigger, something more catchy.\n\nOn Sunday, Pelosi called Israel, her caucus\u2019 top messager, and asked him to come up with a list of ways they could force the issue in the House before the chamber left for its July 4 recess.\n\nThey spoke again later that day with representatives from roughly 100 gun-control advocacy groups to discuss other options, coming up with the \u201cNo Bill, No Break\u201d mantra that House Democrats would start chanting on the floor Tuesday when Republicans refused to recognize Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) for a vote.\n\nIsrael came up with a list of options that Pelosi floated to the fuller Democratic Caucus on a conference call Monday, including asking for a vote in a motion to recommit.\n\nThe Democratic plan was to keep trying anything they could and keep causing a scene in hopes of increasing pressure on Republicans to let members go on record in a roll-call vote.\n\nSeparately, a small group of rank-and-file Democrats was plotting on its own. Just before the week\u2019s first series of votes Tuesday evening, as lawmakers were flying back to Washington from their districts, Clark hosted a meeting in her office to brainstorm ways to force a vote.\n\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici via AP\n\nLarson, whose Connecticut district is near the Sandy Hook elementary school where 20 children were shot to death in 2012, helped drive the conversation. About 12 to 15 people showed, a source present said, including Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.)\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure the House couldn\u2019t proceed until we got a vote,\u201d said one Democratic source.\n\nDemocratic leaders caught wind of the meeting and approved the plan but gave one bit of advice: Go big. If you pursue such an overt demonstration, leaders said, according to one Democratic leader, \u201cseize the opportunity\u201d and make sure it succeeded by tapping a big name to lead the protest.\n\nThe group\u2019s choice for leader was an easy one: Civil rights leader John Lewis, who decades ago protested racial inequality during his own sit-ins in the South.\n\nClark and Larson asked him to take the lead. Lewis accepted, later holding another meeting in his office Tuesday night to finalize their plans.\n\nSome were a bit concerned about the timing. One Democratic aide told Politico he was worried that the sit-in happening on the day that Clinton came to Capitol Hill would look staged and coordinated, when the effort began organically among rank-and-file lawmakers.\n\nBut with the House scheduled to adjourn on Friday for recess, it was now or never.\n\nOn Wednesday, just before Clinton arrived to meet with Democrats and as Larson went to speak to the parliamentarian, Pelosi stood up at a conference meeting to rally the troops.\n\n\u201cMany of you have said that we cannot have another moment of silence without action to follow.

Apart it will be more difficult. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) June 20, 2016\n\nIt's understandable why Europe's elite ain't too proud to beg. The great fear among many is that a Brexit could encourage other nationalist movements and kick off a partial unraveling of the entire EU. Even if no other countries bid goodbye, the departure of Britain would still diminish and weaken the European project, the thinking goes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut could that conventional wisdom be wrong? What if a Brexit is precisely what Europe needs in order to get over the seemingly intractable economic and political problems that have hobbled it these past several years? That's the theory Andrew Lilico, a British economist at the consulting firm Europe Economics, puts forward in an interview Tuesday with Vox, which the site calls \u201cthe best argument for Britain to leave the European Union.\u201d That's slightly misleading. It's more of an argument for why the EU should be happy to see Britain go.\n\nLilico argues that Great Britain is essentially holding back the rest of the EU from fulfilling its destiny as a fully integrated United States of Europe, which it needs to become in order to resolve the contradictions that have trapped it in an unending economic crisis. The eurozone, it is often noted, is a monetary union without a fiscal union. Members are required to live under the same interest-rate policies, which can make or break their economic growth. But there isn't any system to transfer money from flourishing countries to struggling ones, the way the Washington transfers money from New York to Mississippi, for instance. As a result, you see massive disparities in unemployment and growth between countries like Germany and Spain (or, worst of all, Greece). The way to fix that, of course, is to become more like the United States: \u201cthey need eurozone-wide taxes, a eurozone treasury, an elected eurozone president, a eurozone parliament, and eurozone civil servants to manage expenditures,\u201d Lilico writes.\n\nGet Slate in your inbox.\n\nThe problem is that a handful of countries in the EU, including the U.K., don't use the euro, and therefore won't allow the necessary changes that would stabilize the currency union (after all, the British are already ticked off about the money they're sending to Brussels).1 A Brexit, the argument goes, would fix that:\n\n\n\nOnce the UK is out, there will be enormous pressure on other countries to say when they will be joining. Countries that refuse to join will get rolled together with Norway (which isn\u2019t in the single market but has a free trade arrangement with the EU). Then the eurozone can take full control of the EU's institutions and be able to function properly to make it work as a currency union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn short, the EU needs to reach a point where all of its members use the euro and therefore share the same common set of interests for the future. Brexit helps make that happen.\n\nIt's not a totally crazy notion. The idea that the euro will continue to be a shambling disaster until Europe creates some sort of system in which rich Germans can lend a hand to poor Greeks is pretty much taken for granted among American observers, and a tighter fiscal union is most definitely a key part of the EU leadership's long-term plan. And, who knows, maybe this would be easier to achieve if every country in the EU also was stuck with the euro.\n\nBut there are two problems. First, this isn't really a reason for Great Britain to leave the EU\u2014right now, it still gets the best part of membership (access to Europe's free trade zone) without having to suffer through the worst aspect (being stuck in a bum currency bloc). And, unless you believe the pro-Brexit camp's promises that the U.K. will be able to instantly negotiate wonderful free trade deals once it\u2019s off on its own, seceding is still probably going to require some economic sacrifice for at least the medium term. In this case, what's (maybe, theoretically) good for Paris and Berlin might not be so great for London.\n\n\n\nSecond, it's not really clear that freeing itself from Britain will really bring Europe much closer to a glorious federal future. As Pew has found, people also have a pretty unfavorable view of the EU in eurozone countries like France, Germany, and Spain\u2014and the idea of national governments handing even more power to Brussels doesn't go over particularly well anywhere. As of now, the notion of a U.S. of E. has next to no democratic legitimacy, and attempting to force it on voters seems like a recipe for more referendums like what's happening in Britain.\n\nPew\n\n\n\nStill, Lilico does make a fundamentally good point. So long as Britain is part of the EU, the fate of the eurozone will probably rest in part on the whims of a country that's not part of it.

Despite a flurry of negotiations over the past week, and some movement among centrist Republicans toward a compromise that continued over the weekend, there\u2019s little indication the outcome will be any different this time.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have to look at themselves in the mirror and they have to look at their constituents in the eye this November,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said on a recent conference call with reporters. \u201cThey hear the same messages we do from thousands and thousands of their constituents, just as we do from ours.\u201d\n\nThe Senate will take a series of roll-call votes at 5:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic lawmakers are sponsoring different versions of legislation to flag suspected terrorists trying to buy guns and reform the background check system.\n\nBut negotiations between party leaders on something that could actually pass with significant bipartisan support fell apart last week. The National Rifle Association backed a bill from GOP leaders that Democrats won\u2019t accept. Democrats mounted a high-profile filibuster to press for more gun regulations \u2014 a deeply politicized response, in Republicans\u2019 view.\n\nThe uncertainty that remains is whether centrists in either party can craft a deal and sell it to their leaders \u2014 which aides on both sides of the aisle say is a long shot.\n\nInstead, Monday\u2019s votes will be all about gaining political advantage in the November election and positioning each party for any effort to take up gun restrictions in 2017, when a group of red-state Democrats will be facing reelection the following year.\n\nBut this fall, Democrats plan to accuse vulnerable Republicans of being more interested in doing the NRA\u2019s bidding than making the country safe. Republicans counter that Democrats are the ones exploiting a tragedy, the killing of 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe leader of the filibuster, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said the effort led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to draft a compromise bill on preventing potential terrorists from buying guns would not have happened without his nearly 15-hour speech.\n\n\u201cThere is consensus here,\u201d Murphy said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cNone of that would\u2019ve been happening if we didn\u2019t stand up and conduct that filibuster. We were just going to go on, like business as usual.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans say Democrats have already gone too far by forcing GOP senators to vote against Democratic measures \u2014 and then, in all likelihood, turn the votes into fodder for ads against Republicans.\n\n\u201cI understand what Chuck Schumer\u2019s motivation is,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), whose efforts to find a middle ground were brusquely shrugged off by the same Democratic senators working to oust him from his Senate seat this fall.\n\nBehind the scenes, several Republicans are working with centrist Democrats on a compromise that could pass the Senate. Collins backs a bill that would create a narrow list of suspected terrorists who would be barred outright from buying firearms. Her measure would also set up a broader list of suspected terrorists that would be used to notify federal authorities if someone on the bigger list tried to purchase a gun.\n\nThose negotiations continued over the weekend, and even some conservatives seemed hopeful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Susan is so careful about those things and she\u2019s worked really hard to figure out the differences in various lists and what kind of proof it takes to get on that list,\" Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"Some way we should be able to make this work.\u201d\n\nBut Republican leaders have already allowed four votes on gun measures for Monday \u2014 that alone was a win for Democrats given the limited calendar time and proximity to the election. Republicans are growing tired of responding to the Democratic minority on an issue that could be troublesome for them in blue and purple states.\n\nRepublicans would rather turn the scrutiny away from themselves and on to President Barack Obama, who they argue has failed to effectively respond to the Islamic State, the genesis of the terrorism threat against the United States.\n\nView Sen. Chuck Schumer on NRA, Trump, and ISIS Sen. Chuck Schumer holds a press conference on proposed changes to gun laws.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to actually talk about the real cause of that attack, and that is a terrorist attack on our own soil, and why the policies both in the Middle East and here at home are inadequate to deal with the threat of homegrown radicalization,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n\nThe votes on Monday evening are likely to break on familiar partisan lines.\n\nThe first two will focus broadly on background checks for gun sales. That issue stymied the Democratic-led Senate in 2013, which could not advance legislation just months after 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has a proposal meant to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System by boosting its funding and trying to make it easier for the system to gain records it doesn\u2019t already have. The measure would also revise legal definitions on who is barred from owning a gun due to mental-health considerations.\n\nAs a counter, Senate Democrats, led by Murphy, are pushing a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales by private sellers, including at gun shows and over the Internet. It\u2019s similar to legislation written by Toomey with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that did not pass in 2013. The Democratic plan also has provisions to bolster the records kept by the background checks system.\n\nBy making the bill different than the one supported by Toomey, a senior GOP aide argued the proposal is \u201cintentionally partisan.\u201d Toomey is likely to oppose Murphy's background checks because it is more restrictive than the 2013 universal background checks bill.\n\nThe final pair of votes is likely to get more attention in light of the Orlando shootings and the massacre in San Bernardino, California, which were both primarily carried out by U.S. citizens who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.\n\nThe Democratic plan, written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), would allow the Justice Department to block sales of guns to people who are suspected of having terrorist ties. Republicans have said Feinstein\u2019s proposal would intrude on the Second Amendment rights of those who are wrongly included on federal terror watch lists. Meanwhile, the GOP plan drafted by Cornyn would halt a sale only if a judge found probable cause that the person trying to buy the gun is involved in terrorist activities. Democrats say that burden of proof is too high.\n\nAll of the proposals need 60 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to advance. In December, just one Senate Democrat voted against Feinstein\u2019s plan, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. The moderate senator, who is up for reelection in 2018 and has been a source of deep frustration for gun-control advocates, has not signaled she will change her mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust one Republican voted with the rest of the Democrats in December: Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who has perhaps the toughest reelection race among incumbent GOP senators this fall. He issued a news release Friday touting himself as a co-author of the Feinstein plan.\n\nThe NRA is keeping the pressure on Republicans to hold the line. In an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, the group's vice president and chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, called the Democratic push for new gun restrictions an intentional distraction.\n\nTrying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like \u201ctrying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex,\u201d LaPierre said. \u201cAnd this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that\u2019s not going to solve the problem.\u201d", "image": "http://static.politico.com/39/11/6ae2f1bc422eaafbef6f3b1cbe9a/160617-blumenthal-booker-murphy-guns-gty-1160.jpg", "title": "Senate braces for showdown over gun control", "summary": "The first two will focus broadly on background checks for gun sales.\nBy making the bill different than the one supported by Toomey, a senior GOP aide argued the proposal is \u201cintentionally partisan.\u201d Toomey is likely to oppose Murphy's background checks because it is more restrictive than the 2013 universal background checks bill.\n\u201cAnd this president, by diverting the attention to the gun control movement, that\u2019s not going to solve the problem.\u201d\nAs a counter, Senate Democrats, led by Murphy, are pushing a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales by private sellers, including at gun shows and over the Internet.\nTrying to fight terrorism with gun control legislation is like \u201ctrying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex,\u201d LaPierre said.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Brent Griffiths", "Louis Nelson", "Steven Shepard", "Burgess Everett", "Seung Min Kim"], "keywords": ["control", "votes", "republicans", "terrorists", "senate", "showdown", "gun", "democrats", "background", "sen", "democratic", "checks", "braces"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-06-20 10:16:11-04:00", "url": "http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2016/june/donald-trump-campaign-manager-is-out", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump fired his hard-charging campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Monday in a dramatic shake-up designed to calm panicked Republican leaders and reverse one of the most tumultuous stretches of Trump's unconventional White House bid.\n\nLewandowski, in some ways as brash and unconventional as the candidate himself, had been by Trump's side since the beginning of his unlikely rise to presumptiveGOP nominee. But he clashed with longtime operatives brought in to make the seat-of-the-pants campaign more professional.\n\nThe former conservative activist played a central role in daily operations, fundraising, and Trump's search for a running mate, but Lewandowski's aggressive approach also fueled near-constant campaign infighting that complicated Trump's shift toward the general election.\n\nReached by the AP on Monday, Lewandowski deflected criticism of his approach, pointing instead to campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\n\"Paul Manafort has been in operational control of the campaign since April 7. That's a fact,\" Lewandowski said, declining to elaborate on his dismissal. Asked by CNN why he was fired, he said: \"I don't know the answer to that.\"\n\nLewandowski also says his relationships with Trump's top adviser, Paul Manafort, and the candidate's daughter, Ivanka are good.\n\nLewandowski was fired Monday after a tumultuous period for the campaign, marked by infighting and rumors. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement earlier in the day that she wishes Lewandowski the best.\n\nHe is the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party's delegation to the GOP national convention.\n\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks described Lewandowski's departure as a \"parting of ways.\" A person close to Trump said Lewandowski was forced out largely because of his poor relationship with the Republican National Committee and GOP officials. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe move came as Trump faced continued deep resistance from many quarters of his party concerned by his contentious statements and his reluctance to engage in traditional fundraising. Trump was upset that so many Republicans \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell among them \u2014 were reluctant to support him, the person said, and at least partially blamed Lewandowski.\n\nPeople close to Trump, including adult children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., also had long-simmering concerns about Lewandowski, who had limited national experience before becoming Trump's campaign chief. Some of Trump's children were among those urging the billionaire businessman to change tactics for the general election.\n\n\"Firing your campaign manager in June is never a good thing,\" said veteran Republican operative Kevin Madden. \"The campaign will have to show dramatic changes immediately on everything from fundraising and organizing to candidate performance and discipline in order to demonstrate there's been a course correction. Otherwise it's just cosmetics.\"\n\nLewandowski has long been a controversial figure in Trump's campaign, but benefited from his proximity to the presumptive Republican nominee. Often mistaken for a member of the candidate's security team, he traveled with Trump on his private plane to nearly every campaign stop, giving him more direct access to the businessman than nearly any other campaign staffer.\n\nHe was a chief promoter of the idea that the best campaign strategy was to \"Let Trump be Trump.\" Lewandowski frequently dismissed the notion that Trump needed to hire more experienced political hands, spend on polling and sophisticated data operations, and moderate his rhetoric as he moved toward the general election. That approach clashed with seasoned operatives hired in recent months.\n\nMinutes after news of Lewandowski's departure was announced, Trump aide Michael Caputo tweeted, \"Ding dong the witch is dead!\" and included a link to the song from the film, \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nLewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery in the spring for an altercation involving a female reporter during a rally. The charges were later dropped. Trump defended Lewandowski throughout the episode and repeatedly framed his own actions as a sign of loyalty and a demonstration that he would not give in to outside pressure.\n\n\"Folks, look, I'm a loyal person,\" Trump told voters at the time.\n\n\"It's so important,\" he said of loyalty in a subsequent interview. \"And it's one of the traits that I most respect in people. You don't see it enough.\"\n\nLewandowski's consulting firm, Green Monster, was paid more than $360,000 by the Trump campaign through the end of April, and reimbursed an additional $15,000 for travel expenses, according to fundraising reports.\n\nYet his approach within the campaign sparked intense criticism from experienced Republican operatives inside and outside of the campaign.\n\nThe move comes a day before Trump is to attend a major New York City fundraiser, organized by longtime GOP financier Woody Johnson, the NFL Jets owner.

That's down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\n\nTrump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a \"proven history of terrorism\" against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States.\n\nHe also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party's general opposition to gun control.\n\nWhile Trump's comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters.\n\nSome 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump's idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll.

But both have been working on potential alternatives to the Cornyn and Feinstein bills.\n\nCollins said Thursday that she was working with \u201ca group of Republican senators\u201d on a measure that would give the attorney general full authority to deny the right to buy a gun to anyone on the No Fly or Selectee lists \u2013 subsets of the FBI\u2019s consolidated terrorist watchlist of 800,000 names.\n\nIt would also include a five-year look back provision ensuring that the FBI would be alerted whenever someone who used to be on one of those lists, like the Orlando shooter, purchased a gun.\n\nSomeone like Mateen \u201cwouldn\u2019t be denied the ability to buy a gun because he\u2019s no longer on the list, but the FBI would be pinged that he had purchased a gun,\u201d Collins explained, concluding that sequence of events \u201cwould undoubtedly put him back on the list.\u201d\n\nToomey was also in talks Wednesday with a gun-control advocacy organization backed by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to craft a measure that Republicans could live with to prevent terrorists from obtaining firearms.\n\n\u201cThis is not rocket science to figure this out,\u201d Toomey said on the Senate floor Wednesday, adding that he had been speaking to \u201cseveral\u201d senators about a compromise.\n\nBut by the day\u2019s end, leading Democrats were deriding the specifics of the Pennsylvania Republican\u2019s proposal, and a spokeswoman for Bloomberg\u2019s organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Toomey proposed his own language, in which a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would annually vet a list from the attorney general of potential terrorists, who could be prevented from purchasing a firearm or explosive if the court agreed.\n\nMeanwhile, other attempts at compromise fell short.\n\nFeinstein approached Cornyn to try to reach a deal Wednesday, but those talks appeared to have frayed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d Feinstein told reporters late Wednesday of her efforts to find a middle ground with Cornyn.\n\n[Senators target terrorist watch lists]\n\nBoth the Cornyn and Feinstein measures failed to pass the Senate in December following the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif.

The closest the Senate came to making headway in recent years was in 2013, when the Senate voted on a measure written by Toomey and Sen.

That's groundbreaking for a presidential candidate.\n\nThe term \"reproductive justice\" was promoted by the grassroots women of color collective SisterSong over a decade ago to describe \"the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being\" of a person. This means considering a broad array of factors that affect a person's ability to have, not have and/or raise children.\n\n\"For too long, issues like these have been dismissed by many as \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 \u2013 as though that somehow makes them less worthy, secondary,\" Clinton said. \"Well, yes, these are women\u2019s issues. They\u2019re also family issues. They\u2019re economic issues. They\u2019re justice issues. They\u2019re fundamental to our country and our future.\"\n\nThen, she noted that reproductive rights are inextricable from other progressive priorities, like raising the minimum wage, passing comprehensive immigration reform and equal pay laws, preventing gun violence and challenging systemic racism.\n\n\"All the issues we\u2019re talking about today are connected,\" she said. \"They intersect. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m grateful to the reproductive justice leaders in this room and across America. Because you know that all those issues go straight to that fundamental question: whether we believe women and families of all races and backgrounds and income levels deserve an equal shot in life.\"\n\nClinton's speech was a powerful reminder that the concept of \"choice\" is hollow for low-income people who may not actually have a choice when it comes to terminating their pregnancies because they can't afford an abortion.\n\n\"Let\u2019s repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it nearly impossible for low-income women -- disproportionately women of color -- to exercise their full reproductive rights,\" she said.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, on June 10, 2016 in Washington.\n\nThe Democratic Party platform advocated for access to abortion \u201cregardless of ability to pay\u201d in 2012, but reproductive justice advocates have had trouble convincing Democrats to expend the political capital necessary to push for the Hyde Amendment's repeal in a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nClinton also noted the hypocrisy of Republicans who would simultaneously force pregnancy upon women who do not want to remain pregnant while opposing guaranteed paid family leave and policies that would help reduce unintended pregnancy in the first place. The United States is the only developed country in the world that does not guarantee some period of paid family leave for new parents.\n\n\"Have you ever noticed that the same politicians who are against sex education, birth control and safe and legal abortion are also against policies that would make it easier to raise a child -- like paid family leave?\" she asked.\n\nA large portion of Clinton's speech was dedicated to attacking the GOP's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, for his misogyny and for his promise to defund Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court justices who would support overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion.\n\nBut what may ultimately be more significant is that Clinton showed how a high-level, mainstream Democrat can unapologetically explain why repealing the Hyde Amendment matters, even when Republicans will inevitably attack her for supporting \"taxpayer-funded abortion\u201d in the general election.", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/575b09ba1500002b00739eb9.jpeg?cache=8wsrm9vyav", "title": "Hillary Clinton Spoke About Reproductive Justice In A Genuinely Intersectional Way", "summary": "They\u2019re justice issues.\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m grateful to the reproductive justice leaders in this room and across America.\nThe United States is the only developed country in the world that does not guarantee some period of paid family leave for new parents.\nThey\u2019re also family issues.\nThe term \"reproductive justice\" was promoted by the grassroots women of color collective SisterSong over a decade ago to describe \"the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being\" of a person.", "source": "Huffington Post", "bias": "Bias: Left", "authors": ["Samantha Lachman", "The Huffington Post", "Staff Reporter"], "keywords": ["family", "clinton", "spoke", "reproductive", "justice", "abortion", "intersectional", "theyre", "hillary", "speech", "paid", "way", "women", "presidential", "issues", "genuinely"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "None", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/muhammad-ali-orrin-hatch-224132", "text": "Have you heard the one about the Mormon and the Muslim?\n\nPolitics makes strange bedfellows, but there may no odder couple in recent American political history than Orrin Hatch \u2014 the white, rock-ribbed conservative Utah Republican and Mormon \u2014 and Muhammad Ali, the most famous boxer ever, African-American icon and Muslim convert.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYet the two had a friendship that lasted decades, up until Ali's death last week at age 74. Ali's wife, Lonnie, asked Hatch to speak at her husband's funeral Friday in Louisville, Ky., Ali's hometown.\n\nHatch said he was honored to do it.\n\n\"[Ali] helped me by being my friend,\" Hatch said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office. \"I have to say that it was one of the great friendships that I've had in my lifetime.\"\n\nThe better you know Hatch, though, the less unlikely his bond with Ali actually becomes. The senator has struck up similarly quirky connections with ideological or political counterparts in the past. He and the late Sen. Ted Kennedy \u2014 a liberal Catholic whose personal predilections were utterly unlike those of the teetotaling, non-smoking Utahan \u2014 became such close friends that Hatch even wrote a song for the Massachusetts Democrat when Kennedy got remarried in 1992.\n\nHatch is essentially an old school pol; he likes to look people in the eye and judge them for himself. It may not always be an accurate read, but Hatch trusts his own opinion more than what he reads or hears. And the one-time Mormon bishop's default position is that he must \"love everyone,\" no matter who they are.\n\nHatch and Ali first meet in 1988, when Ali made an unannounced stop at Hatch's Senate office to thank him for helping a friend get confirmed to a federal post. Ali had seen Hatch on TV during the Iran-Contra hearings and the brutal Senate fight over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, and he apparently was impressed by the then second-term senator.\n\n\"I like Orrin. He's a nice fella,\" Ali told Insight Magazine in 1988. \"He's a capable man and he's an honest man. And he fights for what he believes in.\"\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch reflects on pictures taken with Muhammad Ali in his office. | Courtesy Sen. Hatch Office\n\n\"He just walked into the office one day and said, 'I like you and I want to support you,'\" Hatch recalled Thursday. \"I said, 'Gee, that means a lot to me.'\"\n\nAli and Hatch \u2014 who did some amateur boxing himself \u2014 took to each other quickly. Ali ended up traveling to Utah and campaigning for Hatch's reelection that year. Hatch later brought Ali to meet his parents, and Hatch's mom made fried chicken for the three-time heavyweight champion.\n\nThe visit thrilled Hatch's parents and cemented the relationship between the senator and the boxer. \"That probably bonded our friendship more than anything else we did, and we did some really good things together,\" Hatch said.\n\nFurther visits to Utah followed. Ali came to Hatch's annual golf tournament \u2014 he didn't play but crashed a golf cart one year \u2014 and the two went to see the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Ali handed out autographed pamphlets on Islam during that excursion.\n\nAli also once gave Hatch one of his (smaller) championship belts and a ring, but the Senate Ethics Committee made the senator return them. The two did hospital visits together and other events. In 1988, Ali attended the Republican convention in New Orleans as Hatch's guest. He wore a button proclaiming \u201cBush in \u201988, Hatch in \u201996.\u201d\n\nYet it was more than a photo-op or a staged event. The two men were genuinely friends.\n\n\"My friend Ali had the greatest personality,\" Hatch said. \"He had converted to Islam and I admired him for that, and standing up for his personal beliefs... He was as humble a man as I've ever met.\"\n\nHatch was fascinated by Ali's charisma, his ability to draw people to him with jokes or hugs or even some magic tricks he'd perform.\n\nThe 82-year-old Hatch remembered going with Ali to a fight in Las Vegas one time. Even a U.S. senator was stunned by the glamour of the crowd around Ali, who at one time was believed to be the best-known person on the planet.\n\n\"There were all kinds of professional athletes there. People that were idols to me,\" Hatch said of the crowd in Ali's penthouse suite. \"I was almost blown away by it all.\"\n\nWhen it came time to go into the arena for the fight, Hatch said Ali told him to grab his hand and not let go. \"People are reaching over me, and elbowing me, they didn't know who the heck I was and didn't care,\" Hatch said. \"They just wanted to touch the great champion. It was a lot of fun. It was something to see how he was treated.\"\n\nAli was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, and the long, slow progression of the illness eventually limited his interactions with others, including Hatch. They would speak on the phone every year or so, but it gradually just became Hatch talking to Lonnie Ali.\n\n\"If there's a hero in this whole thing besides Ali it's Lonnie,\" Hatch said. \"She loved him tremendously, took great care of him, watched over him... I love the woman, she's just a wonderful woman.\"", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201606/683/1155968404_4933482276001_4933476450001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "title": "Muhammad Ali and Orrin Hatch: An unlikely friendship", "summary": "\"Senator Orrin Hatch reflects on pictures taken with Muhammad Ali in his office.\nHatch and Ali first meet in 1988, when Ali made an unannounced stop at Hatch's Senate office to thank him for helping a friend get confirmed to a federal post.\n\"The better you know Hatch, though, the less unlikely his bond with Ali actually becomes.\nThey would speak on the phone every year or so, but it gradually just became Hatch talking to Lonnie Ali.\n\"[Ali] helped me by being my friend,\" Hatch said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office.", "source": "Politico", "bias": "Bias: Center", "authors": ["Nick Gass", "John Bresnahan", "Seung Min Kim", "Brent Griffiths"], "keywords": ["hatchs", "office", "orrin", "senate", "mormon", "ali", "utah", "muhammad", "unlikely", "hatch", "senator", "alis", "friendship"], "tags": []}, {"publishedDate": "2016-06-02 05:31:02-04:00", "url": "http://theweek.com/articles/627055/what-katie-courics-deceptive-editing-teach-about-media-bias", "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nKatie Couric has finally apologized for her misleading editing of a documentary on gun violence. But that shouldn't be the end of this sordid story.\n\nCouric's documentary, Under the Gun, shows her interviewing members of a gun rights organization, the Virginia Citizens Defense League. She asks activists from the group, \"If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\"\n\nThe documentary then shows the silent faces of the activists, giving the impression that they were stumped by the question, for nine awkward seconds. It's powerful.\n\nOh, except for one problem: In reality, as audio uncovered by the Washington Free Beacon shows, the activists did give a range of answers, including sophisticated ones.\n\nJon Stewart turned this sort of deceptive editing into a classic form of comedy. After a question, he would splice in unrelated footage of the interviewee staring to make him or her look stumped, or stupid, or awkward, to great comedic effect. But Stewart was a comedian and never claimed to be a Serious Journalist. Katie Couric is supposed to be a Serious Journalist.\n\nEditing is a craft. No professional video editor who decided to add the footage of stumped gun-rights activists in this particular spot could fail to know what the result would be. Couric's initial excuse that the \"pause\" was intended as a \"dramatic effect\" to \"give the audience a moment to consider the question.\" That is simply not credible.\n\nAnd yet, this is just an uncommonly egregious example of the very-common progressive bias of many figures in the supposedly mainstream media. While they usually don't resort to being actively deceptive, journalists, intentionally or not, frequently frame subjects in a way that advances a progressive narrative.\n\nBut what rankles me most about this case is the hypocrisy.\n\nRemember how last July a group called the Center for Medical Progress started publishing videos exposing Planned Parenthood's practice of trafficking body parts obtained from aborted fetuses? And how Planned Parenthood issued talking points calling the videos \"deceptively edited\"?\n\nI point this out because Couric, who has marched in support of abortion rights, conducted softball interviews with Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, in which she called the videos \"edited.\" (A dubious claim, at best.) As The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway points out, Couric's write-up of the Richards interview stated that the videos \"were edited together in a way to depict Planned Parenthood employees talking about selling fetal tissue, which is illegal.\" Apparently, a far worse sort of \"editing\" is a-okay for Couric herself.\n\nBut it's not just about Couric. Matt Continetti, the editor of the Washington Free Beacon, which got the scoop about Couric, had a bit of deserved fun at the expense of The New York Times, which covered the Couric controversy under this headline: \"Audio of Katie Couric Interview Shows Editing Slant in Gun Documentary, Site Claims.\" \"Site Claims\"!\n\nNo claims by a site are necessary. The audio shows that the gun video was deceptively edited.
